                <h2>Montgorock</h2>
<h4>Javea, Spain</h4>

<h2>BC Festival 150</h2>
<h4>Victoria, Canada</h4>
<p>I was backstage at the 150th anniversary celebrations of the province of British Columbia in Canada. Despite not being the primary photographer for the event, the majority of my photographs were purchased by the concert organizers for use in their official brochures. The artists that participated in this historic event were Feist (Leslie Feist), Sarah Mclachlan, Burton Cummings, Alex Cuba, and more.</p>

Notable musicians and presenters during the event were Michael Bublé, Leslie Feist (Feist), Blue Rodeo, Jim Cuddy, Sophie Milman, State of Shock, Jessie Farrell, Aaron Pritchett, Lindsay Ell, and comedian Russel Peters.</p>
