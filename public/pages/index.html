                While I don't have a ton of experience making PCBs or designing hardware, I do have a small amount. During the COVID lockdowns I started playing with some tube amplifier designs, and to make them more interesting, I threw in some digital logic to control a display and what not.
At the time, my only hardware experience was using the Arduino platform. But since them I've played a tiny bit with both Raspberry Pi and the STM32 ecosystem. Arduino is great for tinkering around, but the general consens...

                As I mentioned before, it's been a 20 year dream of mine to build some type of amplifier that I can use at home and listen to music. 20 years ago I was lusting after a tube amplifier, and even started work on building one during the COVID lockdown. But the more I got into that project, the less enthused I was, mostly because I really have no use for a tube amplifier. In my current apartment I mostly hang out in the living room, and if I'm not listening to Spotify (or some other streaming service...

                Now that the chassis is mostly assembled, and we have a power connector installed, the first order of business is to earth the chassis. As I mentioned previously, this serves the dual purpose of allowing the chassis to shield against electromagnetic radiation, but more importantly, protects the amplifier and its user against a potentially catastrophic fault.
Normally this type of fault involves a live wire or current going where it shouldn't. For example, a wire may slip loose at some point and ...

                Once the chassis is assembled, the next step is to install the IEC power socket and fuse. The IEC socket is a standard size, but make sure you match it for whatever chassis you have. For safety reasons, it's also important to ensure that the mains power supply is fused, that way if there is some type of catastrophic failure, the fuse will limit the damage that can occur (which is important, especially if the failure is damaging you).
The fuse holder I'm using is 5x20mm chassis fuse holder. This ...

                Once I had the idea of building an amplifier, the next step was to find a decent chassis for it. While I appreciate the idea that anything you build yourself is going to be special, not only did I want an amplifier that sounded good, I also wanted one that looked good. I remember reading Walter Isaacson's biography about Steve Jobs, and how Steve Jobs' father taught Steve that even though nobody could see the inside of a computer, or the back of a cabinet, it was important that it looked good as...

                If you look at most photos of do it yourself (DIY) audio amplifiers, they almost always use screw terminals to connect everything together (and rarely have any sort of digital component - they are almost always two channel audio systems). While using screw terminals is pretty easy as a do-it-yourself'er, to me it seemed a bit inelegant.
For example, if you open a commercial amplifier, you're almost always going to see a bunch of neat interconnects between components. So I knew from the start I w...

                In the winter of 2022, I decided to finally realize a 20 year dream by constructing, mostly from scratch, an audio amplifier to use in my living room.

Everyone was in awe that something a person could make at home could sound so good.
Since around that time, I also have been dreaming about building a tube amplifier, and even bought most o...

                One of my favourite outdoor activities for the spring and summer months is outdoor hiking. Over the years I've completed several long distance hikes, and plan to continue trying to get one in every year or so. Obviously with COVID19 things are still a bit up in the air, but it's still nice to work on planning some of the other ones.
