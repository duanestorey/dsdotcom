                <h2>Education</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>2006 - Master of Applied Science, The University of British Columbia, Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong></p>
<p>I completed my master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My master's thesis proposed changes to the new H.264 video standard to increase efficiency and also a transition scalability scheme (H.264 extended layer on a MPEG-2 base layer) for cable operators. My supervisor for my degree was Dr. Panos Nasiopoulos, who was part of the original team that brought the digital video disc (DVD) to the world.</p>
<p>I graduated with a perfect GPA - all “A”s in my academic courses, as well as my thesis and presentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2000 - Bachelor of Applied Science, The University of British Columbia, Engineering Physics</strong></p>
<p>Engineering Physics was one of the only degrees offered at UBC that involved a full five years of academic study instead of four. As a result, it was thought to be the most difficult undergraduate degree offered in western Canada. The degree involved completion of many difficult physics courses (quantum mechanics, solid state physics, nuclear physics), as well as a combination of mechanical, electrical and computer engineering courses.</p>
<p>I graduated with an “A” average, and completed my degree under the Chancellor’s Entrance Scholarship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Honours and Awards</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>2011 - <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7958276B2/en">Patent US7958276B2</a>, Automatic configuration of peripheral devices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1995-2000 - Academic Dean’s List, The University of British Columbia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1995 - Chancellor’s Entrance Scholarship, The University of British Columbia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1995 - Full Scholarship, Simon Fraser University (Turned down to attend UBC)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>2008 - 2017, BraveNewCode Inc., Co-founder and Lead Developer</strong></p>
<p>I was one of the original co-founders for BraveNewCode Inc., a Canadian software company that initially designed and built WordPress websites for clients. Some of our clients were Juno award winning musician Matthew Good, country music star Jessie Farrell, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, and one of Vancouver’s largest software companies, Vision Critical.</p>
<p>We developed two popular WordPress plugins, WPtouch and WordTwit. WPtouch was voted the #1 plugin for all of WordPress in 2009, and WordTwit was voted #3. WPtouch was acquired by SureSwift Capital Inc. in October of 2016.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2004 - 2008, CounterPath Solutions Inc., Principal Engineer</strong></p>
<p>I was originally hired to add video capabilities to CounterPath's (formerly Xten Networks) flagship voice over IP product. After adding video, I helped acquire a few key contracts, including Yahoo! and British Telecom. I was then promoted to one of two principal engineers in the company: I was responsible for overseeing the entire suite of voice over IP products and for acting as a mentor for the other engineers. I eventually took over lead development of the company’s media stack (audio and video) which was licensed to companies such as Yahoo! and used in over 100 million active end points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2001 - 2002 JDS Uniphase Inc., New Product Introduction (NPI) Product Engineer</strong></p>
<p>I was responsible for the manufacturing line where JDSU's most advanced and experimental products were being developed. These included Bragg-grating based tuneable dispersion compensators, laser welded thin-film optical filters, and a MEMS-based optical cross connect. My role was to oversee the manufacturing process for each product and help convert it into an active and profitable product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2000 - 2001, JDS Uniphase Inc., DWDM Product Engineer</strong></p>
<p>I was responsible for the manufacturing of fibre-optic components used in networking. I was responsible, from an engineering perspective, for approximately $500,000 USD of revenue per week.</p>
<p>I was given two promotions within my first year (with a corresponding 50% increase in salary) and was promoted to the New Product Introduction group in 2001 to help bring JDSU's most important products to market.</p>
</li>
</ul>
