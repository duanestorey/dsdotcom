                This is my first post in a long time, as you can tell. One of the reasons I'm writing 
an entry is due to what's been going on in the WordPress world. In case you've been living under a rock,
there is currently a big public battle going on between Matt Mullenweg, the company he runs, 'Automattic', and a rival 
called WP Engine.
I can only speculate as to the reasons for this public spat. On its surface, one side claims it's about a trademark dispute. But based on the actions of 
that same side, ...

                Stock is one of those things that seemed magical before I made it. I had purchased a few cooking books, and many recipes said to use 'vegetable stock', 'chicken stock', 'beef stock', or 'fish stock'. At that time I was used to buying bouillon cubes to take the place of stock, but decided at some point to try making a homemade stock.
Not only is making stock at home easy, but it's a simple way to use up leftover pieces of vegetables and bones. I've grown accustomed now to making a chicken dinner ...

                The Italian Mountain range known as the Dolomites is famously home to several amazing long distance thru hikes known as the Alta Vias, the High Routes. Many of these are old trails from World War I, complete with Via Ferratas, difficult stretches of climbing where a person needs to physically link themselves to metal guide wires. It's been on my wishlist for a few years now to actually walk one of these routes, and I may finally have the chance.
A few months ago I started planning to do one of l...

                With the COVID19 state of alarm shortly ending here in Spain, I've been slowly getting myself ready to do some long distance hiking. My original plan, before COVID19 hit the world, was to hopefully make it to Italy in the summer of 2021 to do a 10 day hike through the mountains. Whether or not that happens this summer is anyone's guess, but I'm still going to act like it may happen, which means I need to start training for a high-altitude hike in the mountains.
For the last month or so I have be...

                I was looking through some of my old posts recently, particularly with regards to COVID-19 and the first lockdown here in Spain, and realized I hadn't done an update in a while. Strangely, it's going on the one year anniversary from when this all started. I had friends visiting from Canada when this all began, and as each day went by more and more activities were suspended in Spain. The first inkling of trouble was that the tickets we had to a futbol match here in Valencia were ultimately cancel...

                This last weekend I finally got around to writing up my trip report for my hike along the West Highland Way in 2018. Now that that's out of the way, I'm thankful I can finally get around to posting my thoughts on the Great Glen Way.
The Great Glen Way for all intents and purposes can almost be looked at as the second half of the West Highland Way (WHW). While the WHW finishes in Fort William, the Great Glen Way literally starts where it leaves off. After I finished the WHW, my friend Tony and I ...

                While I've done my fair share of hiking in my life, as I've gotten older I've gravitated more towards multi-day hikes rather than single day hikes. I certainly enjoy an afternoon hike on a weekend, but there's something magical (and inherently challenging) about hiking for days or weeks at a time.
In 2017 I did my longest hike yet - the Camino de Santiago in Spain. I spent 28 days walking from St. Jean Pied de Port, France, to Santiago de Compostela, Spain, a distance of roughly 800km. When it w...

                I realized this morning that I haven't really given an update since I was smack-dab in the middle of our lockdown here in Spain. Most of us here spent 98 days essentially locked up in our apartments, only venturing outside to quickly get some groceries or to go to a pharmacy. It was one of the most intense and invasive lockdowns of any country anywhere, and many people here really struggled to cope with it. While I didn't mind being at home, especially since I had many renovation projects on the...

                Tomorrow marks the end of the third week of forced quarantine here in Spain, and unfortunately at this point there still is no end in sight. At the start of this week both the active cases of COVID-19 as well as the number of deaths seemed to be on the cusp of plateauing, but yesterday brought new highs for both. I normally try to stay up each night until midnight, mostly to see what the latest numbers are - while they aren't complete, usually there is an update shortly after midnight that gives...

                This morning I woke up and like most days since the quarantine started here in Spain, immediately checked the official statistics to see if the curve has started to flatten yet. Today's update shows rough 5,500 new cases since yesterday with another 443 people having died. roughly the entire capacity of Surrey Memorial Hospital back home in the Fraser Valley. While these numbers are slightly less than the ones from the day before, I've learned not to get too excited with a low day on the charts ...

Little did I know, in roughly two months we would be on lockdown here in Spain for the foreseeable future in an effort to curb the rapidly increasing countrywide death rate associated with COVID-19.
Like many countries who now find themselves in a similar place, Spain mostly ignored the lessons we should have l...

                In 2004, the Human Genome Project was completed. The goal of that project was to sequence the entire human genome, ultimately revealing the cause of a majority of ailments in the modern world.
Instead what it revealed was that most of us share over 99% of our genetic code, and that 1% difference doesn't seem to explain many of our diseases. So if our own genetics aren't entirely responsible for if we are healthy or sick, what else potentially can be?
The answer to that question came shortly afte...

                There is great deal of evidence to show that our guts used to be in a much healthier state decades ago. For example, the Hadza in Africa, one of the last 'hunter-gatherer' species on the planet, appear to have 300% more bacteria in their guts than we do. It seems that over time we have lost many of these bacteria, and whatever functions they once provided.
In terms of gut health, one metric that's often used is diversity. Similar to the environment, it's often thought that the health of any ecos...

                Years ago, when looking for a way to do local WordPress development, I eventually stumbled upon a pretty nifty tool called MAMP.  MAMP stands  for "Mac/Apache/MySQL/PHP", and it's the Macintosh equivalent of the well-known Linux-based LAMP stack.
While you can configure MAMP by editing configuration files, I decided to upgrade to MAMP Pro, as it gives you an easier UI to use when managing some of your local websites.
Despite MAMP 'mostly working', it has a number of really annoying downsides a...

                I live a fortunate life. I have a profession that effectively lets me work from anywhere in the world, all while making an income generally in North American dollars. Popularized by such ‘visionaries’ as Tim Ferris, my lifestyle, and the lifestyle of potentially a billion people by the year 2035, is likely a new world norm. No longer are people like me stuck in offices - we can get on airplanes and work from anywhere in the world - from the remote jungles of Vietnam, to the beautiful mountai...

                Hey everyone,
I've started a new website called TapasForever detailing my goal for living for a year in Spain. If you're interested in the journey, or perhaps want to move to Europe for a year or longer in the future, head on over and check it out.

I recommend visiting the Start Here page for information on the various resources that will be available. I'm looking forward to getting my visa and checking off a lot of boxes in terms of things I would to accomplish in life (Spanish language, I'm l...

                So if you're here, you're likely thinking about moving to Spain at some point. I know this, because that's my end goal as well. Maybe not forever, but likely for a year or more.

One of the first hurdles you may encounter is opening a bank account. Once you have a long-term stay visa or a temporary residence in Spain, you can open an account as a resident. But there are certain advantages to having one sooner. For example, I thought moving larger amounts of money from Canada to Spain would proba...

                One of the hardest aspects of being a business owner is being able to come up with a metric, even an internal one, for what it means for that business to be successful. For some people, that goal is completely monetary - i.e., if they can sell the business for 1 million dollars within 10 years, then that represents success for them.

As an example, one of my good friends recently sold his business. While it was always his dream to build a popular retail business...

This is a brilliant marketing move, and it's help Iceland become a hugely successful tourist destination in the last few years (one tour guide told me that fishing used to be about 70% of the economy, and now tourism is coming close to ec...

                I used to proactively write about every upcoming travel adventure I had, but I tend not to do that much these days. One of the reasons is that sometimes my plans change, and then I end up with a post that's no longer accurate. Another reason is that people, while well intentioned, tend to sometimes aggressively give advice on how I should change my trips around, which ends up putting me on the defensive regarding my choices (most of which are well thought out in terms of what I want to get out o...

                People keep asking me what my next travel plans are, so I thought I would give a little update. While I used to only come back to Canada for a month or two at a time, now that I have my own cottage in Canada I tend to spend longer periods here. Plus, while last year I dabbled in renting my cottage out while I was gone, it's really only the summer months that seem to appeal to most renters; so it makes more sense for me to travel then so I can rent my cottage out and at least break-even while gon...

It's 7am in the morning, and the trail in front of me is barely lit by the LED headlamp I'm wearing on my head. I'm up earlier than I have been over the last few days, mainly due to the orchestra of snoring in my albergue room throughout the night.
Yesterday I limped my way into town, hobbling in pain due to sore knees and a pair of star-crossed blisters on my feet. I had been chewing ibuprofin for the last 12 hours, hoping it would take away some of the pain in my knees and allow me to continu...

                I've been in the market for a new outdoor patio table for quite some time. Unfortunately for me, I didn't really want to spend a huge amount of money on one, which is why I originally was looking at buying a used one.
As I live in a cottage, I really wanted a wood table for my outdoor patio as opposed to a metal one. I spent the last few weeks looking at used offerings in the area, but everything looked pretty beat up or just in an older style that wouldn't really fit in with my decor.

                In less than two weeks from today, I'll be leaving St. Jean Pied de Port, France and starting my 800 kilometre journey to Santiago de Compostela. People keep asking me if I'm excited, and a small part of me at this point definitely is. But I typically don't start feeling real excitement or butterflies until I'm on the airplane heading to my destination.

                While I still have roughly two months before I head to St. Jean Pied de Port, France to start the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage, I have been focusing a lot of time recently with packing. I'd like to start being able to do some practice walks with a full pack shortly, which means I need to get my pack to roughly the same weight as it will be when I arrive. Of course, I could just fill it with rocks for now, but since I already have many of the items with me at home, I thought I'd just finish buyi...

                In about 90 days, I'm heading to London, England, to spend my birthday. As you get older, birthdays become less and less important I find, certainly not enough to warrant a huge drunk at the bar. So I thought this year I would spend my birthday in another country, hopefully meeting a few new people and maybe exploring the countryside.
A few days after my birthday, I'm heading to Spain to start the Camino de Santiago, a famous Christian pilgrimage that ends in the city of Santiago, Spain. Histori...

                Earlier this year, I got a Facebook invite for a surprise birthday party in Malta.

But as soon as I received the invite, I decided it would be really fun to show up, and also a chance to see a little more of Europe.

                Back in roughly 2007, I managed to acquire a clostridium difficile infection. It's a really serious infection, usually preceded by antibiotic exposure, and it can often can lead to death if not treated. In my case, it mostly started out with flu symptoms, but gradually led to me being hospitalized for a few days due to loss of fluids.
Once being discharged from the hospital, I was prescribed flagyl to combat the c. diff infection. I did one or two rounds of that over a month or two, but unfortun...

                I realized recently that it's been almost a full year since I wrote anything on this website. I have tried at various times over the last year to sit down and write, but the words just wouldn't come. But tonight I thought it was probably best to blow the layer of dust off and finally write an update.
And the main update is this: last year my heart broke.
As many people know I was in a pretty serious relationship; it unfortunately ended almost a year ago today. As an engineer, I'm trained to solv...

In about ten days I'll be jumping in the vehicle with my girlfriend and driving across North America, yet again. We moved out to Ontario last year from the British Columbia-area to spend a year in Hamilton, and were forced to do the drive in four days due to commitments that were waiting for us. Thankfully we are going to do the drive back in about nine days, which should be a lot more enjoyable.
This is actually my fourth time moving across the country, and I've done this song and dance enough...

                My girlfriend left the other day to spend three weeks in Italy and Hungary. I have to say, I'm more than a little jealous. I spent three years basically up and travelling whenever I felt like it, but currently we're too busy at work for me to slip away. But the thought of sitting around a patio, nibbling on a wood-oven pizza and sipping a beer sure sounds appealing right now.
As people may remember, Luciana and I moved out to Hamilton, Ontario last year to spend a year working in the new office....

                I was recently looking for a decently priced VPS where I could host a couple of small to medium sized websites. I actually signed up for a few random ones that I found on Google and tried them for a few days, but they didn't strike me as working very well. One of them actually crashed after about an hour, and it took about eight hours for support to finally restart it for me.
Eventually I started looking around the internet a bit more, and ran into a relatively new company called Digital Ocean.

                A friend of mine is making preparations to leave on a big European adventure, and trying to get everything ready before she leaves. One of her recent questions on Facebook was regarding how to be paid as a US-based contractor via PayPal and not lose any excessive money due to currency conversion.

This is actually a tricky problem for a few reasons. First, most banks in Canada only deal in Canadian dollars. If you want to deposit USD into your CAD account you can, but the banks usually tack on a...

                Despite the amount of cool technology I own (iPads, iPhones, etc.), I actually don't really spend much money on anything else in my life, other than plane tickets when I travel. While I appreciate new clothes, my brain rarely comes up with the idea that I actually go buy some new ones. The one exception to that is socks - whenever I see a nice pair I generally always buy them. Which is why I probably own about 100 pairs (and even then it's hard to find a matching pair from time to time).

                I was recently attending WordCamp Europe near Amsterdam, and met Vladimir from ManageWP. I've heard lots about ManageWP over the last year or so, and even helped do an integration with WPtouch Pro to make it work with their system. But I've never actually sat down and spent any time with their system, and decided it was time to sign-up for an account, do a bit of exploring and write a basic ManageWP review to let people know what the service is all about.

                As much as I love travelling to new places, you'll often hear me complaining about how much I dislike the process of travelling - the airports, customs line-ups, security line-ups, crappy airport food, turbulence, jet-lag and many more. For new travellers, these things are somewhat exciting in their own right, but after a while they grow old and tiring.
With that in mind, I was recently reading Anthony Bourdain's travel tips via a link on Facebook (most of which are great) and thought I would fo...

                The last time I was in Brazil, I was there from June until August in 2013, which was basically the tail-end of their winter. The weather was actually quite nice (compared to a Canadian winter), with most days hovering around 20C. But I haven't experienced summer in South America since my first trip to Argentina in 2011.
Given that it's been snowing and below zero here in Hamilton for the last two weeks, seeing the sun again and 30C days is going to be a great change. I'm flying out of Pearson in...

                When you do a ton of traveling, you are invariably faced with finding accommodation wherever you end up. While it's possible to find private apartment rentals for a week at a time, most people that aren't traveling as part of a vacation package generally opt for a hotel for shorter trips.

I'm no stranger to booking hotels online. In fact, I started using Hotwire for most of my bookings not long after the service first came out. While I sometimes wait until I get to a destination prior to bookin...

But now that I have an apartment lined up, I'm back in British Columbia getting ready to do a road trip across North America with my girlfriend.

                I started my long-term travel adventures in January of 2011, almost 2.5 years ago. Looking back, I really had no idea how the airline systems worked: I wasn't really collecting any sort of air-miles, didn't know how to fly for free, nor was I trying to get to any type of elite status (I didn't even really know how to be honest).

                It's hard to be in New Zealand and not eventually stumble upon some of the filming locations from The Lord of the Rings trilogy. While most of the scenic areas from the films are on the South Island, there are plenty of opportunities on the North Island to take a visit to Middle Earth, most notable is of course Hobbiton near Matamata.

                I posted around Christmas about a project I was starting to build an electric brewery. I realized recently that I hadn't given an update with it basically since then, and thought it was time to share the progress.
Most of the parts were waiting for me back in Canada when I arrived back from Australia, so I laid them all out on my temporary butcher block work station for assembly. That butcher block is actually a 7' countertop from Home Depot that I got on sale - eventually it will form the base ...

                In just a few weeks, I'll be boarding a plane and making the roughly four hour trip to Ontario (seven if you count a quick nacho stopover in Calgary). As I've indicated on Facebook, my plan is to move to Hamilton, Ontario for probably a year or so, mostly to work with Dale on some projects at BraveNewCode. Without a doubt I'm looking forward to a new change, as I originally moved out here to Chilliwack to help get BraveNewCode off the ground, something that happened nearly five years ago.

                One of my main strategies for earning free airline travel that I discuss in my eBook is leveraging a travel rewards card. For most people simply using a travel reward card for day-to-day purchases is enough to earn a free vacation each and every year. I've been using a few different cards for three years now, and I've earned a full return trip to Machu Picchu in Peru, a free return trip to Auckland, New Zealand, and enough for another trans-continental trip already accumulated. And all I had to ...

                I friend of mine recently asked if I was putting all my beer recipes online, and I unfortunately was forced to answer no. When I started brewing I tried to put them all online, but the write-ups just took too long.
So I've decided to start posting them again, but in a very limited format. That way it doesn't take me long to post them, and hopefully I can solicit input from others.

                I started brewing beers at home a little over a year ago. Having no real experience before starting, I did what most people do in this day and age and tried to read as much as I could on the internet as I could before starting. While many people start with extract brewing, I decided at the time to just dive right in with all-grain brewing. Like most beginners, I made many mistakes when I started. But over time I have slowly improved the areas where I felt most deficient and have generally been m...

                Over the past few years I've flown to many exotic destinations New Zealand, Brazil, and even Peru. Normally those trips would costs thousands of dollars, but I managed to do all three trips for free thanks to several of my travel reward credit cards.

                There are a few privileged travelers that you encounter from time to time who don’t really seem to have any sort of budget. Often they have saved for several years and intend to continue traveling until it simply runs out.
But for the rest of us, traveling for more than a week or two often means that we have to stick to a pre-defined budget for a particular trip. I know personally that spending money is the one main aspect of traveling that causes me stress, more so than worrying about theft o...

                Unless you are coming from Australia, you’ll likely arrive in New Zealand and be instantly surprised with how hard it is to find usable Internet, or how much money you have to pay to get online.

                Whenever a person goes to a new destination, one of the first things they need to decide is what they are going to bring. And for most people, that depends on the duration of the trip and likely how far they will be traveling.
If I go anywhere for a month or more, I often take one of my larger suitcases to minimize laundry. I figure since I am allowed to check a bag on the plane, I may as well take advantage of it. And since I usually rent a full apartment in a new location, I have room to store...

                A little over 24 hours ago we boarded Air New Zealand flight 83 in Vancouver for a 14-hour trip back to Auckland, New Zealand. I spent four weeks in Auckland about two years ago and really enjoyed myself. My original plan at the time was to slowly make my way south to the South Island and spend some time in a CamperVan, but eventually decided against it because I couldn't find anyone to share the adventure with me.

                A few years ago I visited my physician here in Chilliwack with a complaint of nasal congestion that simply wouldn't go away. It's something that I've mostly always dealt with, but only started to complain about it when I realized that other people didn't seem to have the same problem. My doctor noticed that the inside of the nose was inflamed, so he prescribed nasal corticosteroids to help me breathe better.
Since that time I've visited many different countries around the world. In some of them ...

I had quite a few friends who were into the hobby before me, and it just so happened that there was pretty great home-brew supply shop in town. So I thought at the time it would be fun to try my hand at brewing my own beer at home.
I quite enjoy the entire brewing process to be honest. For me a picture-perfect Sunday usually involves a few movies on Netflix, a roast chicken in the oven for a late dinner, and brewing an occasional beer over...

In the movie The Hunt For Red October the Russian submarine captains use a technique called a Crazy Ivan by the Americans. Basically every once and a while the Russian captains will make the submarine do a complete circle, startling any potential followers behind them. Unless the other submarine is extremely careful, the Crazy Ivan is meant to detect them since it will likely catch them by surprise.

                A few months ago I started a small series to talk about my ongoing goal to make at least $500 a month from this website. You can read How To Make Money From A Travel Blog: Part 1 and Part 2 here.

This Month's Results
In the month of October I made $709 from this website, which is a 100% improvement over the previous month's revenue of $347. That means I not only hit my goal of making $500/month, but I passed it by over $200.
In terms of revenue, here's where it came from for the month of Octobe...

                If you're a routine flyer around North America, you may have heard today that United Airlines dropped a bombshell on its loyalty program members. But chances are you didn't, because it seems that they chose to release the information at night. You know, during Halloween, when everyone is reading the news.
The long and short of it is that many people with accumulated mileage, myself included, are facing a pretty severe devaluation of our mileage. On some international routes on other Star Allianc...

                A few years ago I visited New Zealand and fulfilled one of my lifelong dreams. The highlight of the trip for me was undoubtedly my trip to Matamata, New Zealand to visit the actual, real-life set of Hobbiton from the Lord of the Rings movies.

Due to time constraints, I only spent one month there and only saw the North Island. I had wanted to head down to the South Island at the time and possibly rent a campervan, but it didn't really seem like something that w...

                One of the first orders of business I take card of whenever I land in a new country is to try and get a pre-paid data plan for my phone. Some people chose not to have a working phone when they travel, since it's sometimes a bit of a pain to find the right provider. But I don't see much point in owning a smartphone and not having access to data with it whenever I want.

                After my recent mention on Reddit last week, I decided to try and improve the responsiveness of my little DigitalOcean VPS even more than it already was. I was definitely happy that I was able to withstand almost 20,000 visitors in just a few hours, but thought I might be able to improve things further by switching from Apache to Nginx.
I debated it a long time ago, but never made the plunge for a few different reasons. First, I typically used hosting services based on cPanel. From what I gather...

                If you travel outside of North America you'll quickly realize just how different we do things with regards to power. First, power in North America is typically around 110V, but can range from around 100V all the way up to around 125V. In Europe and many other parts of the world, a voltage of around 220V is normal.

In the old days, prior to intelligent power adapters, if you plugged a device designed for 110V into a wall socket wired for 220V, you could pretty much kiss that device goodbye as it...

                I've been traveling around the world for almost three years now. Without a doubt, nothing is more frustrating than trying to access Google, say in Argentina for example, and being presented with a Spanish website. I don't have exact numbers, but I'd say 80% of companies use some form of GeoIP (geo-location using the IP address as a means to determine where you are) to decide which language to serve you.
The problem of course is that even though I am currently in Portugal, I don't speak Portugues...

                Yesterday I was casually flipping around some apps on my iPhone and opened up my Adsense application which shows me how much I've made from Google Adsense each day. I noticed almost immediately that there was an anomaly - for the current day I had served almost 4,000 ad impressions, when normally it would have been more like 200 around that time of day. I then followed up by logging into Google Analytics to see if I had been mentioned somewhere, and sure enough I noticed that my number one refer...

                One of the downsides to always having the latest and greatest iPhone is that most places outside of North America and Europe seriously lag behind in terms of adoption rates. For places like Brazil and Argentina, that's even more true because the cost of picking up a new iPhone is nearly twice as much as we would pay in North America.
When I went to Argentina in 2012, I couldn't find a Micro SIM card anywhere, and was forced to buy a normal full-sized SIM card and perform surgery on it to make it...

                One of my favourite aspects of travelling is the process of arriving in a new destination. It doesn't really matter how much research you do online before getting there, the actual experience of seeing it for yourself for the first time is always unique and usually unexpected. Almost always a place is better in person that you imagine in your head after doing research, but sometimes it takes a little time to overcome your first impressions after arriving.

                I was recently generating some new server and email passwords, and realized that while most of the strong password generators available online work great for desktops, they aren't very user friendly for entering on iOS or mobile devices. Often you can find a few checkboxes and sliders for those tools to make it a bit more iPhone friendly, but they don't always work. Ideally a password that you frequently use on an iPhone or other iOS device should be "strong" (i.e. have possibly a symbol or two ...

I've been reading a lot of Breaking Bad predictions these last few days and I thought I would toss my own hat into the ring. I'm sure I'm going to be wrong on a few counts, mainly because the writers have been really great at surprising us.
There are lots of spoilers here, so don't read any of these if you aren't totally caught up with watching Breaking Bad.

I've been working on a travel eBook for a few months now, mostly on airplanes and during the odd evening. It's been slow going since I have a lot of other things going on right now, but I've managed to make a bit of progress each week. I'm pleased to announce that last night I managed to put the finishing touches on it, and it's now officially available.
My travel ebook contains two main topics: how you can make and execute plans for long-term travel (anything more than a week or two), and how ...

                I've been trying to track where exactly people go when they leave my website for a few pages recently, and wrote some code based on a few other examples on the Internet. Basically this bit of Javascript will force Google Analytics to log a special request so that you can see where the user went. It uses jQuery, so you have to make sure you have that included in your theme.

Every time I tell my mom about some of the places I’ve recently visited, she seems to reach as though I just barely escaped being killed or taking hostage due to all negative media that certain parts of the world get on the local news. The truth is though that in much of the world it’s just as safe as it is in your part of th...

                Prior to visiting Barcelona for my first time this year, I had no idea who Antoni Gaudi was. But after spending a few days in Barcelona visiting architectural sites, it's pretty clear what a revolutionary architect he was.

                One of the most impressive geological formations in the world are the Cliffs of Moher located in County Claire, Ireland. Located approximately an hour drive away from Galway, it's an easily accessible location in the beautiful Burren region of Ireland, which has an eerie resemblance to a moonscape.

                I've been bouncing around Galway for a week now, and one thing that surprises me compared to a lot of other countries I have visited is how hard it is to find free WiFi. Lots of places seem to offer it on the internet, but when you actually show up to use it you typically only get 20 minutes for free via BitBuzz or Boingo. As someone who typically works remotely as I am travelling, 20 minutes just doesn't cut it.

                Back in high school I signed up to take English Literature, which for me at the time was a rather unusual departure. One of the reasons I decided to take the plunge was due to the rather passionate sales pitch by the teacher at the time, Mr. Chadsey. As it turns out, it was one of my most enjoyable courses ever, and many of the poems and prose I read at the time has stayed with me throughout most of my adult life.

A simple visit to a doctor's office probably won't set you back too far in most countries, but being hospitalized can potentially bankrupt a person in certain parts of the world, such as the United States.

Fundamentally jet lag occurs because your body's internal clock is out of sync with the time in the new location after you arrive. While you can observe jet lag whenever you cross a time zone or two, it's usually more prevalent...

                I used to wear a watch all the time, probably since I was around 18 years old. My first watch was some tacky gold-plate Seiko that I took a fancy too around that age, but over the years I slowly upgraded to more stylish options. That changed around the time I purchased my first iPhone though, when I suddenly stopped wearing one. I guess at the time I figured wearing a watch was a bit redundant since my phone could show the time with just a single click of a button.
But last year I started notici...

While I've tried off and on to make a little money from my website over the years, it's never been something that was really important to me, primarily because I have another full time job that makes me more than enough money. Another reason is that I personally am not a huge fan of most advertising, as I find a lot of it to be intrusive.
That said, travelling around the world and writing about it isn't cheap. I likely spend anywhere from $6,000 a year ...

Last time I was in Ireland, I opted for a Vodafone SIM card for my iPhone. I remember at the time it was reasonably priced and gave me 100MB or so of data. Since I was going to be in Ireland for a month though, I wanted to have more data. I look at Voda...

But unfortunately when I travel finding some of the herbs and spices that I'm used to can be a challenge in many parts of the world, and basically impossible in other parts. A good example of that is chilli powder - it's basically av...

Since she was adamant that she didn't want to bring a full computer with her on this trip, we decided we could make due by sharing my Macbook Air for various tasks. That meant that whoever wasn't on the Macbook Air would have to make due with one of our two iPad Minis.

The Mona Lisa, or La Gioconda, is a painting by Leonardo da Vinci, and is thought to be a painting of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo. Part of the painting's appeal is the beautiful Tuscan background and the enigmatic pose of ...

                After three years of travelling solo and about ten or so of travelling with various businesses, I've become pretty used to booking accommodation online. Hotwire Hotels, Hotels.com, Priceline, HostelWorld - I've done them all. While each of those services listed above has advantages and disadvantages, one service I always go back to faithfully is Hotwire Hotels.

I first heard about the Drobo Storage Array from my friend Tony a few years ago. A Drobo Data Array is basically a self-contained RAID-5 data storage array in a box. For anyone that doesn't know what that means, it's basically a fault-tolerant form of storage where you can lose any one drive completely and still recover all of your data.
Unlike most RAID-5 software or hardware systems though, the Drobo unit is intelligent in that it will work with different sized drives, and expand accordingly ...

                Probably the best book I read last year was Steve Job's biography by Walter Isaacson. I thought it was a fascinating book that showed just what a polarizing figure Steve Jobs actually was.
Recently I found myself looking for a new book, and Amazon recommended Walter Isaacson's biography of Albert Einstein, Einstein: His Life And Universe. I recently finished reading it and I wanted to share my review of it here.

                Whenever I look to book a hostel nowadays, I almost always gravitate towards one of the online booking services such as HostelWorld. Not only can you see a huge inventory of available hostels in the area, but you can also see reviews from recent visitors. Sometimes a hostel with a good rating will have a bunch of poor reviews recently due to something like construction noise nearby, so it is always a good idea to read the reviews in detail.
For our trip to Cuzco, Peru, we decided to stay three n...

                When you travel around as much as I do, you eventually find yourself in need of a rental car. While I'm usually quite happy to take a bus, often it's more economical to rent a car for a few days, especially if you're trying to get to a hard to reach destination (Cape Reinga in New Zealand was one location where I purposefully rented a car).
If you've ever pulled up to a gas station in a rental or unfamiliar car, I'm sure some of you have wondered how to find the gas tank. I personally used to sl...

                I recently returned from Brazil, and decided to stock up on some new electronics. While down at the Apple store I managed to grab a new bluetooth keyboard for my iPad Mini, as well as a few other gadgets. That's when my eye caught some of the Fitbit devices on display in the Apple store, and I decided to get one.

                I recently returned returned about four month's ago from a three week visit to Australia. I managed to make it as far as New Zealand in 2011, but didn't have the time to get across to Australia. Despite appearances, most people think Australia and New Zealand are fairly close - but they are actually separated by a distance that would take between 3.5 and 4 hours to fly between them, which is obviously quite far (like going from Calgary to Toronto).

                Last year I sold my Nikon DSLR and replaced it with an Olympus OM-D M5 micro four-thirds camera. While I've had a few of the micro four-thirds cameras, the Olympus OM-D camera was the first one where the image quality seemed on par with my DSLR, not just for outdoor photos with tons of light, but also for low-light photography as well.
As a former wedding and concert photographer, it was a bit challenging to go from my Nikon and Canon gear (where most of my lenses were f/2.8 or faster) to my mic...

                In 2011 I spent three months living in the beautiful country of Argentina in South America. I enjoyed my trip so much that in 2012 I went back and spent another two months there. From the steaks and tango in Buenos Aires, to the vineyards of Mendoza, to the rolling hills and epic landscape of Patagonia, the Argentina scenery all around the country is absolutely amazing.
If you're thinking about taking a trip to South America, then definitely make sure you visit Argentina, one of the prettiest co...
