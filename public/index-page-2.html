                I was originally looking for a hostel on the internet that was central to Kuala Lumpur and also had a view of the Petronas Towers. Eventually I found the highly rated Reggae Mansion hostel, which had an amazing roof-top bar with views of the KL Tower and the Petronas.
Without a doubt, my stay at the hostel was the highlight of my trip to Kuala Lumpur. After the first night of drinking, most of us quickly became friends in the hostel, often eating together and heading out in the evenings together...

It's no surprise to anyone reading my site that I'm a big advocate of reducing carbs. Pretty much everything out there nowadays is full or both refined carbohydrates and sugar, often in the form of high fructose corn syrup. While complex carbohydrates aren't that bad for a person, anything that converts immediately into glucose (such as simple carbs and sugars) can cause large insulin spikes, leading to fat gain and ultimately diseases such as...

                After traveling the world for almost 2.5 years, I've become pretty knowledgable, mostly through trial and error, about which technology is useful to bring along during a trip and which should simply stay at home. It's not always obvious, as evidenced by about 2 pounds worth of technology currently in my suitcase which I haven't made use of in a long time.
But one item that I've found practically indispensable is a portable external hard drive, especially since many of the new laptops (such as my...

                It has been a long-time dream of mine to finally visit Machu Picchu, the Lost City of the Incas. I actually tried several times over the last few years, but somehow never made it to the ruins. I even bought a plane ticket earlier this year from Vancouver to Cuzco, Peru, but ended up not being able to go due to work commitments. Since I've been living in Brasil for the last month with my girlfriend, we decided it would be a good opportunity to finally visit Peru and Machu Picchu.

                Anyone who uses an iPhone knows that under normal usage the battery rarely lasts a full day. When I'm at home relaxing, the battery life issue is not really that big a deal since I can simply plug my phone into the USB charger half-way through the day and top the battery up to full, usually in an hour or so.
But unfortunately when I'm traveling (which is quite often as most people know), plugging my phone into an outlet isn't always an option . Sometimes when I'm working from coffee shops it sim...

                Luciana and I headed to the airport around 1am last night, with plans to catch a flight at 3:50am for Lima. Obviously that's not an ideal flight time, but since it was heavily discounted we thought we could live with it. Another reason we booked that particular flight is that it was with TAM airlines, and they happen to be with Star Alliance. Since I'm going for Gold Status this year with Star Alliance, I welcomed the chance to get 6,000 more miles with them.

Unfortunately due to the launch of WPtouch Pro 3, I wasn't able to go at the time, and ended up tossing a $1,000 plane ticket in the garbage since Expedia wouldn't give me a refund.
All in all though the launch was a big success, so I can't really complain. Sacrifices like that are part of owning your own business, and why I personally don't feel as guilty when I enjoy a bit of rel...

I'm currently down in São Paulo, Brazil, living with my girlfriend Luciana in her apartment in Vila Leopoldina. The original plan was to spend two or three months here exploring Sao Paulo, and then eventually head to Europe to continue on with our travel adventures.
Our plans have changed somewhat though in that Luciana is now able to travel sooner than she would have originally been able to. So we've decided to accelerate our plans slightly, first by heading on a trip to Machu Picchu tomorrow...

                One of the hardest parts of traveling to remote countries is that it is not always easy to find some of the foods you enjoy the most back home. That in itself presents a great opportunity for exploring new foods, but let's face it: sometimes it's nice to have some tried and true comfort food.
 Homemade Salsa
A good example of that for me is mexican food. It's probably my favourite cuisine, and it was pretty rare that we didn't have tacos at least weekly in my household growing up.

British Columbia's MSP actually is only valid if a person is in the province for more than six months in any given calendar year. If a person is planning on being gone longer, then insurance should be reapplied for upon coming back. Outside of that, a person can make use of a two year exception t...

                For many software developers, grabbing a can of soda is far more natural than grabbing a glass of water. At several companies I've worked at previously the employers even stocked the fridges with free soda. So when given a choice between grabbing a can from the fridge or getting a glass and going to the water cooler, often soda was chosen, especially in my case.

When I was younger I never gave much thought to how much soda I consumed, but definitely in the last few years I've been more consciou...

From there we are going to head back to Ottawa for a weekend, then off to Banff, Lake Louise and hopefully Jasper.

The other reason is that I'm often busy, and so I can simply make an order online and have it show up a week to ten days later.

                I've been a 'world traveler' for almost two and a half years now. Back then I hadn't really been away from Canada for very long before, and the thought of spending multiple weeks, let alone multiple months, in a foreign country was a pretty strange idea.

Now the idea of loading a backpack up and heading to a new country feels about as foreign to me as doing a load of laundry. If I saw a plane ticket somewhere for a good price, I could probably be at the airport in three hours, ready to go on a ...

                Back when I got back from Europe in December, I decided I needed a hobby to help me get through the cold Canadian winter. I eventually decided to take up beer making, since a) I like beer b) some of my friends brew beer and c) most of my friends like to drink beer, especially when it's free.
I've probably done close to 10 all-grain beer brews so far, and I wanted to share some of the things I have learned in this adventure. Had I read a post like this before I started, it probably would have sav...

I had an opportunity the other day to record an hour long podcast with my friend John Biehler. John recently started a technology-based podcast called TekEh that has a particular emphasis on Canadian content and guests.
His first episode was Kemp Edwards from HootSuite, and talked mainly about the experiences of being in Austin, Texas for South by Southwest.
I was excited to be the second guest in the series, and spent an hour sipping a rum and coke and talking about WordPress, our experiences ...

                I was sort of hoping to keep this trip a secret, but enough people know now that it doesn't seem to make any sense to not talk about it anymore (basically, I suck at secrets).
While I have been to South America twice now, there is one destination there that I have never been able to make happen on my previous trips - I have always wanted to visit Peru, and in particular Machu Picchu, the Lost City of the Incas (now found, thankfully). So I decided to finally plan a trip to Peru.

                While there is still a great deal of world left for me to explore, I have to admit that I've managed to see many of the places I was really hoping to over these last few years. In the last 18 months I've visited Argentina, Uruguay, New York City, Ireland, Scotland, Oahu (Hawaii), Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Bali (Indonesia), South Africa, England, New Zealand, Brazil, Malta, Italy, France and Serbia. I also did a few trips around Canada, including Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, and Montreal.

                My previous beer, a Milk Stout, was pretty much a total failure. So I decided I would make another attempt at a stout, this time without lactose though (for arbitrary reasons).
A beer I've always quite enjoyed is Howe Sound Brewery's Oatmeal Stout, so I thought I would try my hand at making an oatmeal stout. An oatmeal stout, as the name implies, uses oatmeal as part of its grain bill. While the oats don't really add a dominant taste, they do impart a particular body to the beer as well as some ...

                Another year is almost upon us, and I thought a final post was in order. It was definitely an interesting year for me, the highlight (at a personal level) probably being a third surgery on my eye socket (which I was told four years ago wasn't possible). But I also did a fair bit of traveling, and I thought a little photo-finish finale was in order for 2012.

                About a week after I brewed my first beer I decided I would get another one in the queue so I would have one more to taste when they became ready. I decided to try my hand at a milk stout, another type of beer I thoroughly enjoy.
I spent some time looking at other milk stout recipes and ultimately crafted something in BeerSmith2 that I thought would taste pretty good (based on a theoretical imagination in my head of what each of these base malts taste like).
Unfortunately I missed my FG on this ...

I decided when I was in Europe that the first method for all-grain brewing I would attempt when I returned back home would be Brew In A Bag (BIAB). Basically you use a big-ass nylon bag to hold all your grains and have your brew kettle do ...

                So last month when I was in eastern Europe I saw that Square released their Square credit card reader that plugs into the headphone jack on iOS devices and can be used in Canada. Apple has always had a mobile credit card system at their Apple stores, but it's something that's been harder to obtain for the rest of us. I look at this type of device as a potential game-changer, since it essentially puts commerce into all of our pockets.

While I had a good time on my last trip, it wasn't something I was totally looking forward to at the time, mainly because I had just gotten through recovering from a big surgery and was enjoying life around home.
In terms of my surgery, I think the end result is quite a bit better. I had a private CT scan done in Serbia so I could gain some peace of mind with regards to the outcome, and here was the end resul...

                France - the legendary birthplace of Roulette - has a very long tradition of playing gambling games. The popular French game 'Poque' is thought to be the forerunner of modern poker. This lends itself perfectly to the story that modern poker derived from French settlers in the Louisiana basin before it moved up the Mississippi.

And while there are always interesting things to do in each new city or country I visit, sometimes I miss some of the comforts of home (such as english TV or movies).
Back home when I am bored I typically watch Apple TV or Netflix. Unfortunately when I am outside of North America and I try to access Netflix I often end up with a message like this:

 One Argentine penguin. Answers to the name of "Waddles". Last seen in Malta, but visited Rome briefly. Could be anywhere between Sliema, Malta and Novi Sad, Serbia. A handsome reward, in beer, for his discovery.

                In exactly four weeks from today, I'll probably be waking up in Vancouver General Hospital after having my third surgery to correct some orbital fractures I received in 2006. I met with the surgical coordinator yesterday to complete all the pre-surgery documentation giving the surgeons my consent to operate on me, one more time.
The surgeon performing the operation is one of the best in his field, even internationally. Years ago he helped start Singapore's eye care centre, and he frequently trav...

                Vancouver has always been the only destination I've considered for the past few years to spend summer near. Last year unfortunately was a bit of a bust due to the weather, but I managed to spend four months around the Vancouver area back in the summer of 2011. I came back from Argentina at the end of June and spent a month in my home town, and am now in Yaletown for the remainder of August.

                It's been quite a while since I've done any sort of update on here, and I thought now was probably a good time to do one. I'm back from South America, and have been staying in Chilliwack for the last month. I just checked into an apartment in Vancouver's Yaletown, and will be staying here for all of August. I haven't lived in Vancouver for at least three and a half years I believe, so it will be nice being right downtown again.

                While I own several guitars, I previously have never attempted flying with a guitar. A quick Google search on the Internet reveals a lot of confusion about the process, as well as a few horror stories about damaged or stolen guitars. An infamous story of breakage ended in a viral internet video known as "United Breaks Guitars":

When I was in Argentina in 2011, I ended up having more free time than I thought I would have. In those moments, I really missed having access to a guitar that I could p...

                To be honest, it still feels a bit strange to be using the "Argentina" category on this blog again. When I left in March of last year, I wrote my final entry and had not envisioned coming back so soon. But as I mentioned in my previous post, after being away for a while I started to miss some of the better parts of this city, as well as some of the friends that I have here.

As people who read this blog know, I started off this great travel adventure of mine last year in that very city. At the time I was a pretty green traveler, and struggled with the language and figuring out how the city worked for the first month or so of my trip. I was frustrated a few times, and a little disheartened with how hard it was at first to meet people. But I eventually overcame most of those obstacles, and probably...

While it ended up being relatively light, having only a single focal length lens significantly impacted my ability to take the photos I wanted to. Other than one or two shots that turned out well, I didn't really walk away from Argentina ...

                I was reading about the Rio Theatre and their liquor license issues over at http://www.miss604.com. To summarize, the Rio theatre applied, and was granted, a liquor license for their movie theatre. Their intention was to have limited showings of movies where alcohol could be served to adults. The BC Liquor Control Board has now placed a restriction on the license which essentially means they can't use it to that effect anymore (not without cancelling regular movie screenings).

At the time I had become a bit bored of life in Chilliwack, and wanted to take advantage of the fact that I can work anywhere with an internet connection and actually see some of the world. I sold most of my furniture at the time and put the rest into a storage locker. And almost exactly a year ago, I boarded a plane and headed to South America.

I spent approximately eight months of this past year living out of a suit...

                Now that I've had time to reflect on my time in New Zealand, I thought I would post an update with what I thought of the country in general.
First, New Zealand is gorgeous. I didn't get a chance to visit the South Island on this trip, but I made my way from tip to tip of the North Island. One thing that's pretty amazing there is just how green the grass is. We have green grass in Canada, but it's more of a florescent green in New Zealand - it's pretty surreal. It's like what grass looks like whe...

                As many people now know, I'm back at home in Chilliwack. I left Wellington a little over a week ago, flew to Auckland, and caught a flight back to Vancouver. I was always planning on being back for Christmas, but decided to leave Wellington a bit early to get back home and sort a few things out.

I have a few more posts to write about the last few months of travel - I'll try and get those done over the Christmas break. But people keep asking me what my plans are, so I thought I'd detail those a ...

                In less than three days I'll be vacating my little apartment here in Auckland and hitting the open road again. Most people told me beforehand that Auckland wouldn't be that interesting, but I quite enjoyed my time here. Here is a summary about my four week visit to Auckland, New Zealand.
First, I took two weekends worth of sailing lessons from a pretty famous New Zealander named Penny Whiting. While I still have a ways to go, I now have a Certificate of Sailing Competency, which should allow me ...

                Last summer I was sitting in a rented room in Vancouver, trying to decide where I was going to go next on my little adventure. I had always had New Zealand at the top of my list, but given how it was winter in the southern hemisphere, I needed to come up with a plan that didn't involve freezing to death. After all, I am a migratory nerd, so I should probably follow the sunshine.

That's when my friends, Scott and Sam, contacted me and said they were going to be in Thailand for a few months and t...

I'm only in Auckland until the end of the month, but I have a pretty busy schedule until then. This weekend I start sailing lessons with the Penny Whiting sailing school. It looks like there are about 8 people in our group, so it should be a fun experience. I've already received some introductory material, so I'll spend the next few evenings going over it to get ready for the course on Saturday.
One of the items we were told is that we're not allowed to wear any non-white soles on the sailboat....

                I left Koh Samui just a few days ago and flew up to Bangkok. My original plan was to spend three days in the city and then fly out to Auckland, New Zealand on the following Monday. Unfortunately though, the flood crisis in Bangkok was hitting the tipping point, and residents were being urged to get out of the city if they had the means. Since Air Canada was offering free change fees on all flights in and out of Bangkok, I decided to change my flight around.
All in all it worked out for the best....

                As per my last post, I was supposed to spend the weekend in Bangkok this weekend and then head to Auckland on Monday. But given how people are evacuating from Bangkok, I decided to try and change my flights around to get out before things get even worse.

Thankfully most airlines (including mine, Air Canada) are offering free change fees on flights to and from Bangkok due to the flooding crisis there, so my ticket was eligible for a change. I tried calling last night to sort it out, but unfortun...

                I checked out my hotel in Ubud, Bali and made my way down to the airport. I gotta say, driving in Bali is one of the scarier driving experiences I've ever had. People are fairly ruthless on the roads, and most of the paid drivers are extremely agressive (passing in the other lane when there's lots of traffic). You sort of have to trust that these guys know what they are doing, and do your best not to pay too much attention to what is going on.
I heard that traffic might be bad, so I left the hot...

                After visiting Kuala Lumpur for five days, I decided to take a three hour flight down to Bali, Indonesia. Bali is known as The Island of the Gods due to it's amazing temples. It also happens to be a primary resort area for most Australians looking for an ocean-side vacation.
I spent my first few days laying low in the hotel, mainly to catch up on sleep after a fun, somewhat exhausting weekend in Kuala Lumpur. I was staying in a hotel in Sanur, which is a beach area on the south-east coast of Bal...

                The more research that's published, the more evidence I seem to run into that indicates insulin resistance (and consequently obesity) seems to be related to oxidative stress and/or nutritional deficiencies. As I've pointed out before, one of the strange paradoxes that most theories generally can't explain is why obesity often goes hand in hand with poor nutrition. That is, if obesity is caused solely by overeating, then we should see the lack of obesity in populations where food is scarce or nut...

I always knew I would be in Kuala Lumpur briefly, since I have a 9 hour connection there on my way to New Zealand. But outside of that I really wanted to make a trip down to Malaysia, if only to see the Petronas Towers in person.
Given that my laptop was dead in Phuket, I decided to simply head down to Kuala Lumpur early. I stumbled upon a really cheap flight ($50) on Malaysia airlines and booked it the same day. Five hours later I was getting off a plane in Kuala Lumpur and heading down to the...

                After leaving Koh Tao, I took the ferry back to Koh Samui and boarded a Bangkok Airways flight for Krabi. Krabi is a little town on the west coast of Thailand, and one of two gateways over to the Phi Phi Islands (the other being Phuket). Given the distance between the two locations, I couldn't find another way to get to Koh Phi Phi in one day, other than to fly to Krabi instead of bus. So that's what I ended up doing.
The ferry was late getting back to Koh Samui, and even though I had pre-booked...

                I left Koh Samui in the afternoon on Friday and made my way down to the Maenom ferry dock. I booked a high speed catamaran with Lomprayah. They actually had a deal going on where they would include a pick-up at your hotel, so that worked out great. They give you a 20 minute window where you need to wait in front of your hotel, and eventually a shuttlebus picks you up and takes you down to the ferry. We actually were there with plenty of time to spare, but I suspect that's deliberate since they h...

                By the time this year is over, I will have spent nearly eight months away from home and on the road. I've been to South America, Europe, back to North America, over to Asia, and will soon be heading down to Oceania. I'll have close to 100,000 kilometers of flying under my belt by the time it's over, and will hopefully have my silver elite status. And yet despite all the traveling I have done though, I haven't really done much backpacking, other than the odd weekend trip.

                Last year my friend Dave got his genetic profile done up by 23andMe. Basically they can take a saliva sample, extract your DNA from it, and then compare it against all the current research in the field of genetics.
When they originally launched they were asking over $400 for each profile. I've been patiently waiting for a sale to get mine done, and eventually managed to find a coupon to bring the cost down to $99. So right before leaving to Thailand I mailed off a saliva sample to California and...

                I've been in Thailand now for about three weeks. So far, it's pretty much everything I hoped it would be. Food is amazingly cheap, the people are super friendly, and in general Thailand is really laid back and accommodating. While the weather has been mostly cloudy lately, it's still warm by North American standards, and a daily dip in the pool has become part of my routine.

Back home a Pad Thai dish probably runs around $12 or $13 a plate. Some of the best Pad Thai I've had here costs around 5...

                I had heard of the legendary full moon parties in Thailand before coming here, but I wasn't entirely sure I'd get a chance to check one out. It wasn't until I got set up in Koh Samui that I realized Koh Phangan, the island where the full moon parties take place, was literally next to us. So it seemed like a shame to be so close and to not visit it.

                A few weeks ago I stumbled across a few websites where you can order custom clothing from Asia. Since I was heading to Asia, I decided to Google around and see how easy it was to get custom tailored clothing in Thailand. Sure enough, not only is it easy, but tailors in Thailand are extremely prevalent.
Unfortunately, many of the tailors here are simply around to sell you expensive fabrics. Once purchased, they are sent somewhere else along with your measurements for the actual sewing. Often you ...

                I made it!
After nearly 18 hours of flying, I finally landed in Koh Samui a few days ago. My friends Scott and Samantha had an airport shuttle booked for me, so I simply got in the shuttle after landing and headed down to my new apartment here.
The place I'm renting is about a 10 minute walk from the beach, but it's in a new complex with a pool, internet, maid service (for $5 a pop), and air conditioning. Normally these units run for about 21,000 Baht/mo (around $700 CAD), but because we were re...

About a week ago, I got word that my cousin Corey had died back in Chilliwack. It obviously caught everyone off guard, since he was only 38 years old and was relatively healthy. As a family, all we have been left with are questions, sadness, and the hole where Corey's life used to be.

When I returned from Europe in April, I went down to my storage locker to grab a few items.

                I gotta hand it to the S&amp;P ratings agency - I didn't think they had it in them. After the other two ratings agencies reaffirmed AAA rating a few days ago, I thought S&amp;P would simply cave to political pressure and keep the rating in tact as well.
In fact, I read a few news articles that basically seem to allude that the government was frantically trying to get S&amp;P to keep the rating in tact. There was even talk in congress about passing some legislation to restrict the ability of the ...

                Earlier this year I was visiting the city of Ushuaia, Argentina, which is the southern most city in the world. I spent an afternoon visiting a penguin rookery, which was absolutely amazing and probably one of my best memories from my last trip. In the town of Ushuaia I ran into a store that was selling a bunch of plush penguins. I thought at the time it would be pretty cool to take one along with me on my travels, but unfortunately just didn't have the room in my bag to bring one back with me on...

                The senate passed the deal to raise the debt ceiling today, which means the United States can pay their bills and not default. But truthfully, that's probably the worse thing that could have happened, since the US has delayed dealing with some very hard problems.
First, let me comment on the ratings agencies. Right after a deal was announced, two of the three major rating agencies reaffirmed the United State's AAA credit rating. These are the same ratings agencies that also gave AAA ratings to t...

                Canadians who just show up in Thailand are usually given a 30 day tourist visa without any hassles, or so I'm told. But given how I'm heading there for two months, I require a visa that is valid for a longer than normal duration.
Generally people in my scenario can simply do a visa run, where basically you exit the country and return a short while later. In Buenos Aires most people would simply head over to Uruguay for the day and obtain a new 90 day visa upon return.
But truthfully, I didn't re...

                I wrote a post recently about my travel metrics from the last six months. One of the observations I made was that I had spent roughly $500 a month on average for airfare. Given that I gave my apartment up in British Columbia prior to leaving, airfare is one of my only extra expenses I have when I travel. Taken together with a $90 a month storage locker and roughly $50 a month in travel insurance, that's a rough cost of $650 a month that is in excess of what I would normally spend back in North A...

                I've been a pretty loyal user of Apple's Macbook Pro line for the last few years. I purchased my first one after Northern Voice in 2007, mostly because the laptop that I recently had Vista installed on failed to work for me during a presentation. Since then I've probably been through three or four of them, often upgrading every year or so to keep up with technology. The first few were the 15" model, and the last Macbook Pro I purchased was a 13" model.

                One of the hardest parts about traveling with technology is lugging all of your gear around with you. Once you arrive at a destination and rent an apartment, you can store some items and only carry along a few things at a time. But when you're in the process of traveling to or from a destination, you have to have all your items on your person for a period of time.
