                Yes, it's that time of month again, maid day. When I got sick with pneumonia in the fall my mom came and spent a few days with me and ended up cleaning my entire apartment. Being a busy, single guy, it was in a pretty sad state. My mom, being a constant worrier, implored me, for her sake, to get someone to help clean my apartment so it would be clean and I wouldn't have to worry about getting sick at home.
Since I'm sort of cheap (at least for things that don't involve technology), but wanted to...

                As of October of 2007, Apple has sold approximately 120 million iPods worldwide. At approximately $250 each, that's $30 billion dollars in revenue. It is without a doubt one of Apple's crowning technical achievements, both for the ingenuity of the hardware and for the revolutionary integration with software on several platforms.

And yet lately, as I've trekked the 30 minute walk between my home and work with my iPod blaring away, I've started to wonder what the impact of this technology really ...

After work I'm meeting up with Rebecca, Kasia and maybe Keira for some wings and beer. Life's rough I know.

                I get a lot of notifications in my inbox daily about scientific rumblings going on in the world, but this one caught my eye this evening. Some recent NASA data in the arctic region seems to point to a huge acceleration in the melting rate of the ice -- should the melting continue at its current rate, NASA scientists project that it's only a matter of years before the arctic might be completely ice free in the summers.

While Europe is ahead of North America in this regard, we have slowly been migrating most of our North American television services to digital, and in most cases, HD. I believe the US has a target date of around 2013 to be completely digital.

                2007 is officially in the past now, and today was basically the start of a whole new year, at least in terms of my routine again. I spent the day at work today getting back into the groove again. Tomorrow I will most likely dive head-first into a fairly large new project, which should be pretty exciting.
I still have some unpacking to do from my trip, and will most likely take the tree and decorations down this coming weekend. At that point, the holidays will be completely behind me. I think tom...

                I rarely dream, or remember them at least. Last night however, I had one of the best nights of dreaming in a long time. Most of them were a bit messed up, and a few of them were of the past. I woke up at around 5am this morning actually feeling like it was about ten years ago based on some dreams I was having. That's a strange feeling.
Then, at 6am, the fire alarm went off, so I spent the first few minutes trying to find something to wear downstairs, and then evetually stumbled down 15 flights o...

                Well, I made it. I had originally been scheduled to fly out on the 2nd of January, but since I figured everyone would be tired and hungover on the 1st that I'd just head back then and get rested up for the grind again. After everyone left the hotel, I called West Jet to see if there were any openings on any flights. Pretty much the only one that worked was the 7am flight out of Toronto. Since it was already 4am, I figured I might as well just head to the airport and sleep on the plane.

There's already one on Facebook that mimics the old version (although, it's basically a wrapper for a website that already has it), but I have some ideas that will sort of bring the game into the modern age, including a mobile component.

Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema have reached agreement to make J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit," a planned prequel to the blockbuster trilogy "The Lord of the Rings."
Peter Jackson is set to oversee the film adaptation of "The Hobbit."
Jackson, who directed the "Rings" trilogy, will serve as executive producer for "The Hobbit." A director for the prequel films has yet to be named.
Relations between Jackson and New Line had soured after "Rings," despite a collective w...

If you haven't seen it, you should immediately head out to the movie store and rent it. It's full of touching moments, laughter, self discovery and even a dash of romance.

                Heat is a totally awesome movie starring both Al Pacino and Robert Deniro. There are many classic scenes in it, but one that stands out is the coffee shop banter between Pacino and Deniro where we learn a pile about both characters. This type of scene has been used in countless movies since then, but they all basically pay homage to this part.
Why I think it's so fascinating is that both characters open up to each other and somehow relate, even though they are basically enemies by trade. And let...

                Last night I made the long trek out of the downtown core and ended up near Metrotown, which surprisingly isn't as far away as I imagined. Chad has a really nice pad out there, complete with an outdoor deck that would be just killer for summer parties and BBQing.
Chad has a tradition at his party where everyone has to pick a decoration for the tree, and then proceed to make love to it somehow. Not sure how this came to be, but everyone eagerly began licking and kissing their decorations.

There were about 150 people that probably showed up, and it got rather tight and cramped at times, but it was cool meeting a lot of the people involved, and hanging out with a few old friends.
