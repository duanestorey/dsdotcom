                <p>So, this weekend I decided to leave the city life behind and join my dad and Cathy for a few days in the wilderness down south.? The destination was a little place along the ocean called Fort Casey, near Deception Pass, Washington.? I had a great time, consuming an ample amount of alcoholic beverages, and sitting by the fire.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the one major downside to travelling to the United States is having to go through customs on both sides.? No matter how many times I cross, or how many stamps I have in my passport, I always get grilled pretty hard.? It's gotten worse now that I have a decent car.? ? The way down wasn't that bad, although the border guy asked me &quot;do you have anything in the car?&quot;, which I had no idea how to respond to.? &quot;Uhh, yeah, I have stuff in the car.&quot;? ? The way back was even worse.? My dad gave me a Calvin Klein duffle bag that he got for free when shopping in the duty free shop.? I figured all I had to do was tell the border guy I got a free bag, and I would be on my way.? Here's how the conversation went:</p>
<ul>
<li>Border guy: &quot;Can I see your ID&quot;</li>
<li>Me: I hand him my ID.</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;No, I don't want to hold it.? I just want to see it.&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;Uh, ok&quot;.? I open my passport and show it to him.</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;Where you from?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;Vancouver&quot;</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;Where were you?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;Camping near Fort Casey.&quot;</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;Why were you camping alone?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;I was camping with my parents.&quot;</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;Where are you parents?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;Not with me.&quot;</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;You bringing anything back?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;Yeah, my dad gave me this free bag.&quot;</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;What's it worth?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;It was free.&quot;</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;But what is it worth?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: Obviously confused.? &quot;Zero.? It was a gift when they bought something else.&quot;</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;Nothing is free.? What is it worth?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: Holding the bag up to the window, showing him the big sticker on it that says *Free*.? ? &quot;It says free, I think that means it was free.&quot;</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;Yeah, but what is it worth?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;Uhh, $10.&quot;</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;It looks like it's worth more than $10.&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;How about $20.&quot;</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;Ok.? Anything else you're bringing back?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;No.&quot;</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;What about alcohol? Any of that?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;No.&quot;</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;Any tabacco?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;No.&quot;</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;Any weapons?&quot;</li>
<li>Me: &quot;Still no.&quot;</li>
<li>Border guy: &quot;Ok, go ahead then.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, I hate crossing the border.? Ironically I always have more problems getting back into Canada than I do leaving it.? Oh well.</p>
