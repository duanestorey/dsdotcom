                Strangely enough, most people in Vancouver probably don't remember me as ever being super skinny. For whatever reason, I've always had a bit of meat on my bones. You can chalk it up to a slow metabolism, or crappy genes or whatever, but there are not many times in my life where I've been rail thin.
The first time I came close though was probably around grade 11. I was playing three sports at the same time, getting lots of rest, and for the most part, lived a pretty stress free life. I couldn't t...

                Despite being tired, I dragged my ass down to the gym tonight. Without a doubt, it was probably one of history's most pathetic workout sessions, but I managed to get through it. I also score fairly low on the whole "coordinated gym-goer" scale, mostly because I don't have any shoes that are really gym worthy. I have a pair of running shoes, but they're not really meant for going to the gym, and they hurt my feet. So instead, I usually wear a pair of vans or something else to make sure there's a ...

Seattle's one of those cities I always expected to fall in love with, but for whatever reason, just haven't managed to yet. I suspect it's because I don't really know where to go when I'm in the city, but I'll do a bit more research this time around.

Two important states, to be sure. For me, I find myself bouncing between those two states from time to time, often as a result of some cycle I'm trying to break. Most of the time, that cycle for me starts with lack of sleep, and progresses into this weird state of limbo where I'm constantly feeling unhealthy.

I still think there's lots of promise with their grid service, but I don't think their paying cliental should be used as guinea pigs on technology.

                It's widely recognized nowadays that many people have a condition known as insulin resistance. Internally, their cells have become desensitized to insulin, which ultimately forces the body to create more of it in order to meet the cellular demands on the body (insulin is required to move glucose into the cells for usage). Unfortunately though, high insulin levels lead to heart disease, type II diabetes, obesity (or a difficulty in losing weight), high blood pressure, and are potentially implicat...
