                <p>I just did a quick check of my Google calendar for the week, and it's look pretty jam packed for the next few weeks. Things start off with a bang tomorrow -- I have to go to St. Paul's Hospital for some intestinal tests in the morning, and head down to Vancouver General Hospital tomorrow evening for an MRI (two hospitals in one day people, good times). Just did some reading on an MRI, and it's not a very dangerous procedure, unless <em>you have certain types of implants in your eye socket</em>. I'm fairly certain mine is ok, otherwise we wouldn't be going ahead with this, but I've seen one too many TV shows, so I'm a bit nervous now.</p>

<p>On another note -- I picked up the movie "Across The Universe" the other day based on a recommendation from Dan Lilly. It's the most unique movie I've seen in a long time, and to be honest, I actually really enjoyed it. Even my dad and my step-mom were talking about it the next day. It's sort of like a cross between Moulin Rouge and a 60s psychedelic film. So yes, there are guys periodically breaking into song -- if that makes you uncomfortable, this movie probably isn't for you. But anyways, I'm watching it right now for the second time in the last 24 hours. You should check it out.</p>
