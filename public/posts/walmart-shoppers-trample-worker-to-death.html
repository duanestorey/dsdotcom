                <p>This is one of the most <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/11/28/2008-11-28_worker_dies_at_long_island_walmart_after.html">tragic things I've read in a very long time</a>. Shoppers at a WalMart were so eager to get through the doors for today's sale that they literally stomped one of the workers there to death. Even while he was down, people still trampled past him, with nobody stopping to help him up or make sure he was ok. Another worker also hit the ground, as did a pregnant lady.</p>
<p>I really have to question what type of world we live in where something like that can happen. It's one thing at a music concert when something like that happens due to a surge in the crowd (which still isn't acceptable), but when people are literally stomping a man to death in order to save 25 cents on some toilet paper, you seriously have to question what is it inside of us that can be so brutal.</p>
<p>What a sad, crazy place we live in sometimes.</p>
