I hardly even realized we were into October until today (shows how little attention I pay to dates), but I guess that means I'm in the clear. This is a pretty relaxed month in terms of things going on for me (which is a nice change), but November more than makes up for it (a stag, a wedding reception, and a trip to Mexico are the highlights next month).

HARVEST MOON: Tonight's full moon has a special name--the "Harvest Moon." It is the full moon closest to the northern autumnal equinox. Long ago, before electric lights, farmers relied on the Harvest Moon to light up their fields at night, allowing them to harvest autumn crops even after sunset.
The Harvest Moon of 2006 is a big one--almost 12% wider than some full Moons we've seen earlier this year. Why? Because the Moon is near perigee, the side of the Moon's lopsi...

It disrupts REM sleep, making you feel tired in the morning
It increases cortisol, making you feel stressed out
It distrupts the body's glucose system, increasing insulin levels by as much as 50%
It makes weight loss difficult since the body can't burn fat with high levels of insulin i...

                Well, the last 24 hours have been very frustrating. It started at around 3:30pm as we left the Boston Waterfront Hotel and headed to Logan Airport. Our original flight was supposed to leave at 6:30pm, bounce through Toronto, and get us back into Vancouver at around 11pm PST. Once we got to the airport they informed us that our 6:30pm flight would be cancelled, but there was one at 7:30pm we could catch. This also changed our Toronto-Vancouver lag of the journey, getting us at home (in theory) at...

                Well, in about nine hours I'll be lifting off from Vancouver International Airport, heading for Logan airport via Toronto. I'm actually pretty surprised how normal I feel about flying tomorrow. I thought I would be pretty nervous. Maybe flying with 3 of your close pals makes it a bit easier, or maybe it's the thought of the stewardess and her cartload of beer that makes it worthwhile.

But now that I've done a week of development on the little mac mini beside me, I can honestly say that development on a mac mini is just a bad idea.

                So there's this buzz amongst photographers about this new technique called HDR (high dynamic range). The basic idea is that a camera isn't capable of capturing nearly as much dynamic range as what our eyes can capture.? With HDR, you take multiple shots of the same scene using a digital camera on a tripod, and create a new photograph using the information from all the shots. That new image contains a much larger dynamic range than would be possible using any one shot.
Here are some cool examples...
