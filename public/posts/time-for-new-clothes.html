<p>I haven't purchased anything new for myself to wear in probably a full year at this point. Unfortunately for me, that means most things in my wardrobe are starting to look pretty ratty. In fact, I was wearing a shirt the other day and noticed at the end of the day that there was a big hole in it that didn't used to be there.</p>
<p>Yes it's true, I'm that awesome.</p>
<p>I was telling Dale the other day that I'm probably about two shirts away from seriously having to consider wearing a garbage bag for the day. So, definitely time to go out and buy a few new things. Unfortunately, I don't really want to buy that much since I'm about to leave traveling and am only bringing one backpack worth of stuff. But, I can't continue living like a POW, so I need to buy a few items at least.</p>
<p>So I'll probably head into Abbotsford or Langley on the weekend and see if I can score a few new items. I'm also in the market for some new sunglasses for my upcoming Mexico trip. I'm hoping to solicit the help of some girl I know to perhaps take along for the ride - I suck at picking out clothes, and can use whatever help I can get.</p>
