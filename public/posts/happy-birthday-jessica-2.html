A few hours later I was back in Chilliwack, and Jessica, my niece, was welcomed into this world. Over the course of her life, I unfortunately haven't been around as much as I would have liked. But thankfully now I'm in Chilliwack and I can spend more time with her.</p>
<p>One time I was back in Chilliwack visiting and decided I wanted to get a Whopper from Burger King. Jessica asked if she could come with me, so we went together. Here's a photo of Jessica with her jar of bees and her flower.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday Jessica -- your uncle loves you!</p>
