                <p>It's finally here. After over a full year of campaigning, tomorrow the United States will be voting on who will be the next president of the United States. As I've blogged about many times before, I'm hoping Barack Obama wins. Compared to most politicians in this day and age, he seems upfront, humble, intelligent, and with an honest desire to improve the state of America.</p>
<p>I'm probably going to hole myself up tomorrow near a TV and watch the coverage as it happens. Without a doubt, this is bound to be the most important political event that I've witnessed in my lifetime. Whoever wins tomorrow will have eight years of damage to work on repairing, eight years of failed foreign policy to contend with, and an economic crisis (that many believe may ultimately be comparable to some aspects of the Great Depression) that threatens jobs and consumer confidence on a global scale.</p>
<p>If you have any thoughts about the election, feel free to drop a comment. I predict a record turn-out of voters tomorrow, with Obama ultimately winning.</p>
