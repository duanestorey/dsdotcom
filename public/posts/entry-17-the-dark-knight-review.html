                <p>I've always been a fan of the super-hero genre of films. Spiderman II was without a doubt my favourite of the bunch so far, mainly because of the character development and chemistry between Peter and Mary-Jane.</p>
<p>While I have enjoyed the Batman series of films, I was never really that interested in the character. I think of all the versions, I like Michael Keaton's version the best. Batman Begins was an interesting film, but I wasn't entirely sold on the depiction of Batman by Christian Bale.</p>

<p>I've seen The Dark Knight twice now, and I think it's as close to perfection as you can get with a super-hero movie. A remember actually feeling emotion with a few of the scenes, especially near the end when everything is finally unfolding.</p>
<p>The Dark Knight is a depressing film. It shows great people trying to do great things, only to have them all undone by the madness of the Joker, a character that will go down in cinematic history thanks to the performance given by Heath Ledger. Ledger's Joker manages to somehow stay a step or two ahead of Batman, Dent, and everyone else in the movie, and represents one of most brutal antagonists of any movie in this genre. He's smart, he's ruthless, and most definitely crazy. And that is why he can always seem to get the upper hand on everyone else, because he literally abides by no rules.</p>
<p>I don't want to spoil the film for anyone, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes these types of films.</p>
