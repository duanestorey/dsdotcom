                <p>I came across this as part of my morning read. Sort of gross, but I actually know of similar things happening to people. My cousin works at Holt Renfrew in Pacific Center, and she said one time someone went to try on some clothes, and came out of the change room practically running to the door. When they went into the back, they found she had used the entire change room as a big bathroom (I guess she really had to go).</p>
