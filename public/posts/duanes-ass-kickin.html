                <p>When I was back in Chilliwack last weekend, I had this strange urge to play tennis. I used to play like ten years ago with Jeff, Landy and Michele, but I had no idea where my old raquet was. So, I went down to Cottonwood Mall and picked up a new raquet and some tennis balls. After hitting the ball against the wall for about 20 minutes, I realized that it wasn't as fun as I had hoped it would be.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that right after I got back into Vancouver, I talked to Jason and he was asking me if I played tennis. So, today Jason and I went down to David Lam Park and played some tennis (my first game in about ten years). Even though Jason kicked my ass across the tennis court, I was actually pretty happy with how I played. I just gotta figure out how to serve again, and slowly improve my game.</p>
<p>Jason and I had a rule that for every ball we hit over the fence, we'd owe the other guy a beer. Unfortunately, nobody hit the ball over the fence, so we both have to supply our own beer.</p>
<p>Final score 6-0. 6-2.</p>
