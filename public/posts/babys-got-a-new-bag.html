                <p>As you can see, things look a little different around here after tonight. I got tired of looking at my old theme about two days after I put it up, but just didn't feel like doing anything about it. So tonight while watching Million Dollar Baby, I decided to take a stab and making it a bit different.</p>
<p>It's nothing fancy -- all I did is start with the default Wordpress theme and add a few things here and there. The main header is a HDR sunrise I did off my patio about a month ago. Gravatars are broken right now, but since Keira and I seem to be the only ones using them, it's not really any big hardship. Also, I'd like to get the concept of "notes" or "asides" back, but I want to do something new with them (I was thinking some kind of Ajax ticker tape maybe?)</p>
<p>I'll try and get those working and finish things off sometime this weekend. Feel free to comment on what you think so far.</p>
<p>** One of the unexpected side-effects of all this is that it seems to be so much faster now.</p>
