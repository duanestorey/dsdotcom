                <p>I was just lying on my bed, opening some mail from the last few months that I haven't gotten around to opening. I thought since I have an appointment for taxes coming up that I should get all my receipts and everything in order.</p>
<p>In one envelope, I find this letter, apparently involving some parking violation I had around Christmas:</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>THIS IS TO COMMAND YOU IN HER MAJESTY'S NAME TO APPEAR BEFORE A JUSTICE ON APRIL 14, 2008</p>
<p>In case you're not following the date, that was yesterday, and I obviously didn't show. The next part is the worrisome piece of information:</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>FAILURE TO ANSWER A SUMMONS IN PERSON OR BY COUNSEL MAY RESULT IN APPLICATION BEING MADE FOR A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST</p>
<p>Can you say fuck? I'm setting my alarm and calling down first thing in the morning to try and sort this out. How do I get myself into this shit.</p>
