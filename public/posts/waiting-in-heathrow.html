                <p>So I have a few minutes to kill here at Heathrow, so I thought I would write a quick blog entry. The flight from Vancouver to here was relatively uneventful. The guy next to me was sort of a prick, and unfortunately for me I don't think he brushed his teeth yesterday, but I survived. I haven't slept a wink, so I'm hoping I can sleep for an hour or two on the next flight to Helsinki. I think my next flight is delayed slightly, which means I probably won't get into the hotel until around 10pm or so. One thing is for certain -- I'm definitely going to be ready to have a nice long sleep when I get there, and wake up bright and early for a fun filled week of work.</p>
<p>My laptop is about to die, and apparently I was too dumb to pack the European power adapter in my carry-on, so I gotta end this entry now and go look at perfume or liquor or something for another hour or so. I'll do a quick blog entry when I get into Finland later.</p>
