                <p>Given that summer is just around the corner (at least, I hope it is -- it's really hard to tell with this weather), I decided about 6 weeks ago to try and get in better shape. One of the things I wanted to do when I moved out to Chilliwack was to be a bit healthier. I've definitely done that in terms of what I eat, but not so much in terms of how much exercise I get in a typical week. Summer is usually better for me as I like hiking and playing tennis, so I'm sure it'll increase.</p>
<p>When I got back from Hamilton at the start of March I decided to start hitting the gym hard and being very critical of what I eat or drink. I've had the occasional beer, but for the most part I haven't really been drinking all that much (burning 400 calories at the gym and then drinking 1,500 calories worth of beer seems counterproductive, even by engineering math).</p>
<p>Anyways, down 12 pounds so far and I'm on the last hole on my belt. Like the tortoise, slow and steady wins the race.</p>
