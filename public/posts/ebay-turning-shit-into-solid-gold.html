                <p>Considering that my 70-200mm f/2.8L is completely hosed, and there's absolutely nothing I can do with it, I figured I would just toss it on eBay and see if I could get like $50 from some guy that wanted to play with it or something. So, you can imagine my surprise when, after getting out of the hospital and checking my eBay page, I noticed that the sucker had sold for $260.</p>
<p>I was completely clear in the description that the item doesn't work, and that it would require major repair. But still, I'm completely astounded that someone would pay that much for what I perceive as basically a paper-weight.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go around the house tomorrow and see what other broken things I can flog on eBay.</p>
