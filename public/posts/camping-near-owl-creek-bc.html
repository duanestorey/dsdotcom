                <p>This last weekend my friend Dave and I made a hasty escape from the city and headed towards Pemberton. I ad a pretty rough prior week, as did Dave, so we were both looking to get away for a few days and simply enjoy some time in the outdoors.</p>
<p>The place we ended up going to is called Owl Creek, and it's a small campground about 15 minutes past Pemberton, BC. Usually when I'm up in that neck of the woods I head on up to Birkenhead Lake, but Owl Creek is about 40 minutes closer from Vancouver, and offers a nice bit of seclusion.</p>

<p>Despite forecasts calling for heavy rain, most of the weekend was a mix of cloud and blue sky. So we spent most of the days just chilling by the campfire, sipping some Howe Sound brewery beers, and chatting the days away.</p>
<p>If you're looking to get away from city life for a weekend and escape into a tent, then I'd definitely recommend the Owl Creek campground. There are only about six or seven sites, but the seclusion and lack of noise make for a great, relaxing weekend.</p>
