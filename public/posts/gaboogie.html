                <p>When I first started my current job, the COO and one of the founders was a guy named Erik Lagerway. During the time he was at our company, we shared many a beer and even a plane ride or two together (the most memorable being the one to Phillidelphia where we got to witness first-hand drunken broomball in Horsham and Whatchamachukinchunk).</p>
<p><a href="http://gaboogie.com/"><img src="images/gaboogie_logo.gif" alt="" /></a>His current brainchild is a service called <a href="http://erik.lagerway.com/t.cgi/488">Gaboogie</a> which was designed in an attempt to simplify conference calls in the enterprise environment. Most conference calls today are setup via email, and involve participants calling into a conference bridge at a specified time, entering a six to ten digit conference code followed by a password, and then sitting around for ten minutes waiting for all the late comers to show up.</p>
<p>Gaboogie attempts to circumvent some of these problems by having the conference system call the participants itself at the correct time, forcing people to be punctual, and removing the need for passwords.</p>
<p>I was actually sitting around in the bar with my friend Chris a few months ago, and we hashed out something similar over a few beers. The only difference we came up with has possibly having the service send out courtesy SMS reminders 10 to 15 minutes prior to the conference for those people that had associated a cell phone with their account.</p>
<p>I think it's a great idea, and I'm pretty sure it will take off. So, good work Gaboogie guys, and best of luck.</p>
