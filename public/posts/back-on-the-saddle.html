                <p>Despite being tired, I dragged my ass down to the gym tonight. Without a doubt, it was probably one of history's most pathetic workout sessions, but I managed to get through it. I also score fairly low on the whole "coordinated gym-goer" scale, mostly because I don't have any shoes that are really gym worthy. I have a pair of running shoes, but they're not really meant for going to the gym, and they hurt my feet. So instead, I usually wear a pair of vans or something else to make sure there's a clear separation between the cool people and me from a fashion perspective.</p>
<p>Upon leaving, I decided to hop on the scale at the gym. It was kind of a beat up model, but I figured it would be accurate. Unfortunately for me, my heart dropped when I realized it was showing me as a lot heavier than I thought I should be. So first thing I did when I came home was to pull out my fancy digital scale from a box and hook it back up. Thankfully, it was exactly where I thought it should be, so I guess the scale at the gym is wonky or not calibrated properly. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.</p>
<p>But anyways, I'm hoping I can start getting a decent sleep such that going to the gym becomes a normal routine for me. With any luck I'll get up tomorrow morning and hit the gym again, this time a bit harder.</p>
