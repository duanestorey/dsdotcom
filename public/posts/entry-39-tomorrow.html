                <p>Tomorrow should be an interesting day. We're going to leave Workspace here sometime around 6am. With any luck, I'll be fast asleep sometime around 6:15am. Tomorrow there's a baby shower on the north shore that I'd really like to attend, so as of now I'm hoping to hit that. But in the odd event I feel like complete garbage tomorrow, I'll just head back home. But, assuming I feel ok, I'll be swinging by the North Shore for a while tomorrow.</p>
<p>I have a bit of work I need to do when I get home tomorrow back home in Chilliwack, so I'd like to be home around supper time if possible. But, given how my sleep schedule is completely messed at this point, I really don't know what tomorrow will look like. I'm still short on vacation time this summer, so I booked a few days up at Cultus Lake this week. I'll still do some work during the days, but am planning on picking up a few books and just chilling out inside my tent, or in a chair under the stars.</p>
<p>I'm also still $10 short from my goal, so if you're thinking about donating, now would be a great time! Thanks everyone!</p>
