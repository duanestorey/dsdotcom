            <p>In case you don't know who <a href="http://greaterfool.ca">Garth Turner</a> is, he's a former MP and now financial guru who has been predicting the troubled real estate market for years. Obviously not many people took him seriously a few years ago, but the majority of his predictions have panned out.</p>
<p>Tomorrow night Garth is speaking to a sold out audience at the Four Seasons hotel in Vancouver. Since Vancouver is thought to be ground zero for the impending real estate market implosion in Canada, many people are obviously eager to hear him speak. The event was originally planned for around 300 people, but due to popular demand, is over 1,100 people now I believe. I signed up for the event a long time ago, and thankfully made the list before they sold out. I've been following Garth's blog now for about six months, so it'll be interesting to hear what he has to say.</p>
<p>I'll post my thoughts on his talk on Friday, or possibly the weekend.</p>
