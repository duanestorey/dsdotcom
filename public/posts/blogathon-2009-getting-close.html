                <p>I just got off the air with <a href="http://www.895thehawk.com">The Hawk</a>, Chilliwack's Rock station, located at 98.5 on your Chilliwack/Abbotsford dials. <a href="http://www.miss604.com">Rebecca Bollwitt</a> is currently putting a recording of the broadcast on her Viddler account, at which point I'll put it up here for everyone to listen to recorded the interview, and has provided it for everyone's listening pleasure -- thanks Rebecca!</p>
<p>I hadn't really thought about a goal for fundraising, so I said I was going to attempt to raise $2,000. The good news is that I think that's a realistic goal, but I'll need everyone's help. So if you can help at all by pledging, then <a href="http://www.canadahelps.org/GivingPages/GivingPage.aspx?gpID=4875">please do so here</a>. I'll be on the radio again on Monday talking about the final stats for the event.</p>
<p>As mentioned on the air, this year I'm supporting the BC Children's Hospital. Being back home this year and spending time with my niece and nephew has made me realize that there is probably nothing worse than watching a little family member get super sick and end up in the hospital. So I'm going to do what I can to help them out this year.</p>
<p>I'll probably be heading into the city on Friday night to spend Blogathon with a few of my friends. Writing 48 blog entries in a period of 24 hours is actually extremely difficult, so I'll need all the motivation I can get.</p>
<p>Thanks if you tuned in today. As I mentioned, I'll need everyone's help to hit my goal of $2,000, so if you <a href="http://www.canadahelps.org/GivingPages/GivingPage.aspx?gpID=4875">can contribute anything</a>, that would be appreciated.</p>
