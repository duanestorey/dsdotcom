                <p>Well, in just a few hours, yours truly will be turning 30. I originally set out last night to write something memorable, and spent a few hours writing a blog entry that I hoped would detail the last ten years of my life. However, upon waking up this morning, I realized that it wasn't really what I wanted to say, probably because I think it was heavily influenced by the events of the last six months.</p>
<p>The truth is, this has probably been the hardest year of my life. Between a big breakup, that assault in November, a surgery and some other personal things in my life, it was really quite a challenge to get through it. But the good news is that I did get through, mostly with the help of some great friends and family.</p>
<p>So, as I turn 30, I'm going to take this opportunity to turn the page on some of the bad things that have happened, and to say thanks for all the great people in my life for helping me get through them. I am looking forward to all the amazing things that will happen in the next ten years, and the people I will get to share them with.</p>
<p>For everyone in my life, thanks for being with me this whole time. I hope to see most of you out tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Here are a few photos from the last ten years. Also, thanks Matt and Rebecca for the public birthday wishes on your blogs.</p>
