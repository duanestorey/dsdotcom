    <article class="main section content">

            <p>This upcoming weekend I'm shutting the computers down and heading over to Vancouver Island. One of my best friends from high school (and also university) lives over in Oak Bay in Victoria now -- strangely enough I haven't really seen him in about a year, mainly because we've both been busy.</p>
<p>I'm sort of known amongst my friends as the guy who is always busy. I don't try to be, it just always seems like there's some event or something I've committed to that I have to go to. That's why a few months ago I said I was taking a break from all the Vancouver events -- it's not that I didn't want to go, I just really needed to make up for some lost time with a few people in my life. My friend Jeff has been to Chilliwack a few times since moving to Victoria, but we just haven't had a chance to get together this last year.</p>
<p>This last weekend I was in Vancouver and made a point of heading to North Vancouver to see Ianiv and Arieanna, since I didn't get a chance to visit them over Christmas. Likewise, I decided I would clear a full weekend and head to the Island to spend a few days just chilling my friends Jeff and Michele and their 2.5 year old daughter, Maya.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helijet.com/n/">Helijet</a> saw that I was looking for a way to get to Victoria, and offered me a free Helicopter ride on Friday in exchange for a few photos, which is totally awesome. So on Friday I'll head into the city and board the Helicopter for Victoria, arriving sometime around 5pm or so.</p>
<p>I have no plans really -- just hang out with some old friends, passively drink a few beers in front of the DVD player, maybe even hit a park or two with Maya. I may even leave the laptop locked up in the trunk of my car, and spend a weekend completely away from everything. Regardless, I really like Victoria, and am looking forward to a weekend away.</p>
