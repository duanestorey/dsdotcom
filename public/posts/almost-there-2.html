                <p>In less than 24 hours, Blogathon kicks off in Vancouver. I forced myself to go to bed around 11pm last night such that I would have a pretty decent sleep. I tried to get up at around 7am, but my body wasn't too happy about it, so instead I slept in until around 8:30am, and now I feel pretty decent.</p>
<p>In theory I should go easy on coffee today such that tonight I can have yet another decent sleep, so that's probably what I'll do. Tomorrow however I'll be pushing my little donkey cart down caffeine mountain there and riding it all the way to the bottom. I'm hoping there's some easy to access coffee at <a href="http://www.abetterplacetowork.com">Workspace</a>, otherwise I'll have to head out at some point and get some.</p>
<p>I'm currently up to $330 worth $430 worth of pledges, which is obviously awesome, as it means I'm 33% 43% of the way towards my goal (of $1,000), and Blogathon hasn't even started yet. So thanks for everyone who has supported me so far, and to all the people who might be sponsoring me during the event. My charity of choice is the BC Children's Hospital Foundation, and all proceeds go directly to the foundation and to the kids. If you'd like to donate, even a small amount, you can do so <a href="http://www.canadahelps.org/GivingPages/GivingPage.aspx?gpID=4875">by clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>Tomorrow at 6am Blogathon begins, which means I'll probably be awake sometime around 5am and getting ready. I'm hoping to crash on a friend's couch in the city tonight, and also spend a few hours doing research. See you all tomorrow!</p>
