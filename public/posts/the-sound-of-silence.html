                <p>Someone came to look at my apartment in Vancouver the other day, and their first comment about it was how noisy they thought it would be with all the traffic over the Howe Street on-ramp. I guess after living here for years, I've sort of grown used to it.</p>
<p>Truthfully though, it is really loud. While lying in bed this morning I heard at least three loud sirens in about ten minutes, along with tons of trucks, cars honking, and traffic over the bridge. I've never really been one for earplugs, mainly because I'm paranoid about sleeping through a fire alarm or something like that. That being said, I tried wearing some ear plugs the other night, and actually ended up sleeping a lot better.</p>
<p>I'm pretty certain that noise will not really be a problem in my new place. There's no police station, firehall or hospital nearby, so the chances of hearing a siren are pretty much zero. Also, I'm not really next to any major roads, so I don't think I'll hear much in the way of traffic during the night. It's been years since I've had a sleep that wasn't interrupted by noises, so it's going to be a welcome change living somewhere quiet again.</p>
