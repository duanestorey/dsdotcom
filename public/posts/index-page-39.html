                All my stitches are out. This is day five after surgery now. All the areas are a bit red, but they're healing. Was nice to take a real shower today and also shave.

It generally takes about 6 months for surgery sites to finish healing, so I still have lots of healing to do. A little bit of trivia - after 7 days, surgery sites only have about 7% of the tensile strength of normal skin. So still have to be careful for a while....

But, I'd like a bit more input from some photographers about features I can potentially add.

Tonight some of my old friends came for a visit, and we went down to the little park near where we grew up to take a few family photos. Unfortunately the weather wasn't really cooperating, and we got rained on a little bit.
One of the biggest challenges for taking family photos is working with children. Children are obviously full of energy, and taking photos isn't always something they like to do, especially when there are swing sets and ducks waddling around. Thankfully Kaede was happy to acc...
