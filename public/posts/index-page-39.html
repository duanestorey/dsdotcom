                Everyone always bugs me at work for sitting in a sort of "lying down" position. However, recent research seems to back me up.

The "slouch" position revealed a reduction in spinal disk height, signifying a high rate of wear and tear on the lowest two spinal levels. Across all measurements, the researchers concluded that the 135-degree position fared the best. As a result, Dr. Bashir and colleagues advise patients to stave off future back problems by correcting their sitting posture and finding a...

                Clay posted an article today talking about the snow, and how his camera tended to make everything look dark. What he didn't realize is that his camera was actually doing what it was probably supposed to do. And here's why.
Almost all cameras have light meters that are set up to try and make every scene around 18% grey. Some guy a long time ago looked around and realized that almost every real-world scene is made up of midtones, and these midtones are usually in the ballpark of 18%. So, whenever ...

I sent his opinion to my plastic surgeon, and he eventually agreed that I do have one and that it should also be fixed. Which raises sort of an interesting question -- how did the two or three doctors that looked at me initially not see this?

                So, I figured it was about time for an update, since everyone has been asking how I'm doing. I had a bad episode today. I was sitting on the couch watching TV, when suddenly I felt a sneeze coming on. It really freaked me out, because I knew at that moment just how painful a sneeze would be. I couldn't stop it, and before I knew it my teeth were bashing together from the sneeze, and my whole head was in agony. That happened about three more times, and by the end of it I thought I was going to pa...

                Normally I'd be writing about Erin's wedding, posting some photos and saying what I good time I had. Unfortunately, something happened on the way home that night that sort of changed the focus of this blog entry. After the wedding, a few of us decided to go down to the Railway Club for a few more drinks. After it was over, everyone slowly made their way into cabs and headed back home. I was the last guy to get one, so since it was proving difficult to get a cab, I made my way into the store righ...

Chilliwack was pretty ahead of the curve, and they even opened up their own computer club that my dad and I dropped in on from time to time (oh yeah, we were cool). ...
