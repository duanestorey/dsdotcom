                <p>I was up late playing around with some stuff on the computer, and didn't manage to actually lay down until around 2:30am. I figured since I was getting up at 6:30am to drive <a href="http://miss604.com">Rebecca</a> to the airport that four hours should be enough time. Unfortunately I think forgot to factor in the amount of caffeine I had had over the course of the evening. So when my alarm started beeping at 6:30am, I realized I hadn't really had any sleep yet.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at the airport, Rebecca had a call from her people out in Toronto letting her know that her flight had been cancelled. So we went to Milestone's restaurant to have something to eat, hoping eventually there would be a plane that would take her to Toronto. The strange thing is Air Canada didn't really offer any excuse or anything for why the plane suddenly wasn't flying at 9am. Thankfully they put her on the 10:30am flight, which when John and I left at around 9am wasn't scheduled to leave until 11am due to some other reason. Those of you who follow my blog know I have absolutely no love for Air Canada, so I'm not surprised at all. Hopefully she's in the air by now and on her way.</p>
<p>For those of you turning in, Rebecca will be on the air tomorrow at 8pm local time on CBC. Make sure you check it out!</p>
<p>I got home and put my head on the pillow, and just woke up now at around 1:30pm. So much for Saturday morning.</p>
