                <p>Why is it that hairdressers just can't follow simple instructions? How does "just a little off the top" translate into "shave my head bald?" I just don't get it. I've been trying to grow my hair a bit longer for like six months now, and yet whenever I go in to clean the sides up a bit, they always chop like a full inch off the top, even though they always promise not to.</p>
<p>It doesn't start that way either, which is what I don't get. The hairdresser always says "yeah, don't worry, I'll just take a quarter inch off the top to clean up your ends." And then, it all just goes to shit. Do this people just sit in boredom most of the day, waiting for some dumb sap to walk in so that they test out their latent skills on some guys head, or do I just have really crappy taste in hairdressers? Also, why do they hold that stupid mirror up to the back of your head after they are done? It's not like it's a bottle of wine that I can send back if it's tastes bad -- if the back is all messed up, what can I really do about it? It's like "uh yeah, you cut the back way too short, can you put some of the hair back?"</p>
