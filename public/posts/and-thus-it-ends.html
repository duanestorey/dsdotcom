            <p>Well, folks, Blogathon is over. Most of us left workspace sometime around 6:30am yesterday. I went with Rebecca and John back to their place, and we got there probably close to 7am or so. While everyone was totally fried, there was brief talk about watching a movie for a while to help the brain ramp back down to sleep mode. I laid down on the couch then, and woke up a few hours later to some of the sounds of downtown Vancouver.</p>
<p>At that point I adjusted some blankets, and fell asleep again, waking up sometime around 12:30pm. Unfortunately, I couldn't really sleep anymore, so I decided to just get up at that point. Given that I didn't really have any clothes that were clean at that point, and that my brain was still totally friend, I decided just to head back to Chilliwack and recuperate for the day, which kind of sucks because I had wanted to hang out with some of my friends at a shower today. But given how I was feeling pretty crappy, and the lack of clothing situation (in fact, most of my clothes had ketchup drippings on my shirts -- so classy), I just decided to head for home. So sorry guys -- but next time I'm in Van I'll swing by with a little present.</p>
<p>As soon as I walked in the door back home, I went to check out my patio plants. Not only were they all wilted, but pretty much every single one was on it's side -- apparently they had quite a storm here. All my clocks were flashing as well, so apparently the power was out sometime during the night. I watered all my plants, righted them again, and then crawled into bed for an hour nap.</p>
<p>That hour nap turned into about a three hour nap, and I just woke up. Given that I don't have any food here, I just made an order for some pizza, and I'm patiently waiting for it to arrive. I'm going to do a few hours of work tonight, and then hit the sack early. I believe I'm supposed to be on the radio again at 8am, so I'll do that when I wake up. Then I'm going to head up to the lake and grab my camping spot for the next three days. I'll be mostly camping in the evenings, and doing some work during the days, so I'm not sure how accessible i'll be the next few days.</p>
