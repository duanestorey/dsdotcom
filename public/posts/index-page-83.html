                Sylvain sent me this link today that basically concluded that one or more cans of diet soda can lead to health risks such as the metabolic syndrome

"We found that one or more sodas per day increases your risk of new-onset metabolic syndrome by about 45 per cent, and it did not seem to matter if it was regular or diet," Dr. Ramachandran Vasan, senior investigator for the Framingham Heart Study, said Monday from Boston.

The study included nearly 9,000 observations of middle-aged men and women ...

                I came across this article this morning, which says that Apple is starting to charge a $5 entrance fee into their stores. I'm not entirely convinced it's true based on the wording of the article, but if it is, it's absolutely ridiculous:

If you want to see the iPhone at an Apple store, be sure to bring some cash. Large crowds flocking to see the iPhone and next generation iPods have forced Apple to begin charging a $5 entrance fee for Apple stores. Many analysts anticipated the move, and expect...

Jason sent an update email yesterday:

Sheila and I are very proud to announce that the twins were born at 11:44 and 11:45 on Thursday, July 19th, 2007. Their names are Louis Marc Fischl and Hanna Michelle Fischl. Louis was born 6 lbs and Hanna was 5 lbs 7 ounces. Both babies and Mom are doing well and should be home from the hospital on Monday.

So drop Jason and Sheila ...

                A while, I posted an article on my recent purchase of a Toshiba HD-A2 high-definition DVD player. Since that time, I have slowly been figuring out just what to do with it. After purchasing it, I sort of assumed that it would be easy to rent HD-DVD movies, but it's actually still rather tough. Blockbuster recently announced an exclusive deal with Blue-Ray so that they would only carry Blue-Ray titles. And while a few people have said that it's most likely the death-blow to HD-DVD, I disagree.

                I got bored tonight and threw on a few episodes of 24 Season Four. The whole season revolves around a nerve gas attack. While watching it, I thought I would google a bit and find out about the history of nerve gas and its use in warfare. While scanning the Wikipedia entry for nerve gas, I read these paragraphs:

In 1972, The United States Congress banned the practice of disposing chemical weapons into the ocean. However 32,000 tons of nerve and mustard agents had already been dumped into the oce...

Why people stop blogging
The other day, I wrote a pretty detailed article on my frustrations with how people have been using my Flickr photos, all of which are associated with a creative commons license. In that article, I had an interview with the Vice President of Creative Commons where we discussed what proper attribution means, and some of the grey areas associated with the non-commercial parts of the CC licenses. A few days after I wrote it, Darren Barefoot chimed in with some of his thoug...

My cousin works at Holt Renfrew in Pacific Center, and she said one time someone went to try on some clothes, and came out of the change room practically running to the door. When they went into the back, they found she had used the entire change room as a big bathroom (I guess she really had to go).

                So I found out something pretty cool on Friday night with Wordpress. It was around 11pm and I wanted to put a new post up but have the date say the next day at 1 minute past midnight. The idea being that I could post Saturday's photo of the day Friday night before I went to bed. However, once I modified the timestamp in Wordpress and published the article, it didn't show up at all, which I thought a bit odd at first.
However, after reading through the documentation, Wordpress has the ability to ...

REFLECTIONS
The idea is that you should take photos of the world that show some type of reflection. Be inventive, but some ideas are puddles, lakes, mirrors, glass, spoons, anything that casts a reflection. Send them in and I'll try to put them all in a group somewhere to reflect everyone's efforts!
