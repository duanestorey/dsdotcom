                <p>I'm a gadget whore, plain and simple. If you were to come into my apartment, you would probably be surprised how many useless techie gadgets I have. From my iPod stereo adapter to my Satellite radio in my car, I just love things the beep and glow. This isn't a recent development either -- when I was a kid, my parents always made sure I had some type of computer around to play with. My first experience in the realm of engineering came probably around the age of 12 when I decided it would be a great idea to dismantle my entire commodore 64 and it's disk drive using a screwdriver -- I did manage to put it all back together again, but the look on my mom's face when she came home that day to a floor full of computer parts was absolutely priceless.</p>
<p>As I get older, I've been less impulsive with my purchases, since I now realize that every gadget I own is just another thing that can break and force a costly replacement. So, as things die, I'm reevaluating whether or not I actually really need these things around, and if not, I don't replace them. I recently turned off my Satellite radio subscription (even though it's only $12 a month) because I just don't really use it enough to justify the cost.</p>
<p>But one of the recent side effects of having all these gadgets around is the unexpected noises that they sometimes make. For example, last night I was getting ready for bed when my cell phone started beeping and vibrating violently. The culrpit -- some fun birthday party debachery by none other than <a href="http://www.miss604.com">Miss604</a> herself -- the phone was set to give me a reminder for a late night meeting entitled "Rebecca is great!"</p>
<p>Tonight, while lying in bed, I heard the odd gadget chirping in the other room. After doing some exploring, I found the culrpit in my bag -- a high tech portable computing gadget I had brought home from work. Apparently it likes to let you know when it's not really doing anything by emitting a really loud annoying sound. Thanks gadget. I wasn't doing anything either until you rang -- now I'm walking around my place in my boxers with a hammer looking for you.</p>
<p>I also seem to be fighting an ongoing battle with my iPod to disable the alarm in it. No matter how many times I disable it, it somehow always ends up going off in the middle of the night. Which is sort of stupid really, because it just makes a mildly audible sound that wouldn't really wake me up if my head was lying directly on top of it. I guess I could tape my headphones into my ears and set the alarm, and then maybe it might do something. But for the most part, it just annoys me.</p>
<p>And while this doesn't classify as a beep, my Macbook Pro has a light on the front with a slowly oscillating intensity that indicates it is in sleep mode. However, when I usually go to bed, it's right beside me, and it's sort of the visual equivalent to a dripping faucet. I guess I could turn it off, but that sort of defeats the purpose of having a sleep mode.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm off to bed, assuming the gadgets cooperate.</p>
