                <p>Well, I made it. The flight was, for the most part, uneventful. I actually had to stop in Edmonton briefly which was unexpected. That being said, it got me off the plane for 20 minutes to stretch and get a bit of sunshine, which was nice.</p>
<p>In fact, it was one of the most enjoyable flights in a while. I spent most of it reading a book I picked up in the Vancouver airport called "From Good To Great" which methodically investigated the top 11 companies in the last 30 years to see what they did differently than the rest. I usually don't like business books as most of the authors seem to be full of hot air, however I enjoyed this one, primarily because the author approached it as a research project instead of a "hey I did it, so you can too" type of book.</p>
<p>I'm in a coffee shop right now doing a bit of work on my laptop. Tonight or tomorrow we'll probably be hooking up with Patrick for a few beers. I'll post a few photos when I have a minute or two.</p>
