                <p>I do tons of flying compared to most people. The last few years haven't been as busy as normal, but for a while there I was getting on a plane on average of about once a month to go somewhere with work. I chronicled <a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/2007/11/where-in-the-world-is-duane-sandiego/">some of my trips over the last few years here</a>.</p>
<p>One of the things I've always sort of snickered about on planes is the need to still blatantly point out that smoking is not allowed on a plane. I always thought it was fairly self-evident that one shouldn't light anything while sitting on top of several thousand pounds of kerosene, but apparently I was wrong. It turns out <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/TRAVEL/09/06/flight.diverted/index.html">some idiot on a Jet Blue flight thought he would sneak in a few drags</a> in the bathroom last night. When the guy's family found out they decided to smack their brother around a bit, and ended up causing a fist fight on the plane. The plane then had to divert and land due to the disturbance.</p>
<p>Of course, smoking on a plane is a felony, so that guy is in a ton of trouble. It will be interesting to see what happens now, as I haven't heard of anything like this before.</p>
