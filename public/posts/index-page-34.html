It's not as contrasty as I normally like, and I bumped the contrast up slightly before posting them, but it's not that bad. The dynamic range is pretty decent, and the only shots that it struggled with were taken outside in the sun. All in all, I'm impressed enough that I'll give it another go.

It was a 36 shot roll of Ilford XP2, and it's probably the only black and white roll I've ever shot in my entire life, now that I think about it. The neat thing about this roll is that you can develop it in C41 chemistry (used for colour print film), which means you can basically get it developed anywhere in the city for next to nothing. I also have a few rolls of pure black and white to shoot, so I think it will be a useful c...

                So, I gotta hand it to my pal Kris -- he's managed to get me interested in something I never thought I'd be interested in again -- film photography. Kris is a really awesome fashion photographer here in Vancouver, and his stuff never ceases to amaze me.
What's interesting about Kris, and a variety of the local photographers I've met recently, is that they have started shooting film again. Which is sort of surprising, given the focus local photography shops seem to place on digital nowadays (I ca...

                In the last couple days, I've read several reports of people discovering embedded user data in the new DRM-free versions of music on iTunes.
While I'm not suprised, having embedded user data within these files is essentially a form of Digital Rights Management, which at the very least points to false advertising by Apple regarding these new music files. I'm quite certain that a utility will exist shortly to strip it out, should people want to, but Apple is being very guarded about these files an...

                Yesterday Apple released verison 7.2 of iTunes which finally gives users the ability to download DRM free versions of songs from iTunes. The added bonus is that you can also download 256 kbps AAC versions of the files instead of the 128 kbps AAC versions.
So, before I actually go into the experience, I'd have to say I was slightly hesitant about this. When people think 128kbps, they automatically think of the old MP3s. And at 128kbps, MP3 files are fairly close to CD quality (for most people), b...
