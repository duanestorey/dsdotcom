                <p>While out watering my tomato plants outside tonight, I noticed that a few of the roma tomatoes were looking a bit limp. Upon further investigation, it appears that not only are they ripening a bit early, they also have some weird dark spot on the bottom of most of the fruits.</p>
<p><img src="images/blossom-end-rot.jpg" alt="" />I did a bit of research, and it sounds exactly like blossom end rot. Blossom end rot typically is a result of lack of calcium, which in a lot of cases is due to inconsistencies in moisture or large temperature swings. Given that my plants got pretty dry there a few times, especially in this last heat wave, I'm pretty sure it was probably due to that.</p>
<p>Either way, most of the tomatoes that have already fruited appear to be suffering from it, which basically means I'm hooped. Some of the green ones look ok still, so maybe they'll turn out fine. But it's not going to be a very large harvest, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Oh well, better next luck year I guess. I'll definitely use larger pots next time so that I can water them more and not have to be on constant water watch.</p>
