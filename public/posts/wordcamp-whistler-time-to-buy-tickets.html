                <p>WordCamp Whistler is just around the corner, and we've already seen an increase in ticket sales these last few days. If you're interested in coming, you should go ahead and buy your tickets now. Right now tickets are $35, but as of Friday, January 9th, they'll increase to $40. The following Friday, January 16th, they will increase to $50, and shortly afterwards they will no longer be available. If you'd like to purchase your tickets, please visit <a href="http://wordcampwhistler.eventbrite.com">our EventBrite page</a> and pick up your tickets now. Included in the price of your ticket is a full day of WordPress-related talks, complimentary lunch, a one-of-a-kind piece of winter-related WordPress swag, and access to the social event, complete with a few free drinks.</p>
<p>There are still a few sponsorship spots open, so if you're looking for some extra exposure for your company, and to be a part of the first WordCamp in Whistler, then <a href="http://www.wordcampwhistler.com/sponsorship">please visit our sponsorship page</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Also, we have a really great group rate at the Fairmont Chateau Whistler, so if you're interested in booking, <a href="https://resweb.passkey.com/go/wordcamp">please use this link</a>. Many people have booked both Friday and Saturday nights, so there should be lots to do that weekend and lots of great people to hang out with.</p>
<p>We're announcing the last few speakers today and tomorrow, and then we'll start final preparations for the event. We already have a pretty awesome line-up, and will be adding a few more talks today regarding using WordPress as a CMS, and an SEO power talk.</p>
<p>So, now is the time to act, before it's too late! Hope to see you all up on the hill!</p>
<p>Also, we've just received our first look at the WordCamp Whistler toques! Check 'em out. Everyone who attends will get one.</p>
