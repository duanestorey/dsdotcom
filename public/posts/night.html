                <p>Did a quick HDR off my patio before bed. And before I drop off, here's one more bit of info -- my dad and step-mom are getting on a plane at 7am to spend a week near Cancun relaxing. They usually spend most vacations every year in the RV camping somewhere, and this is the first trip that they've taken to a far-away place (except of course when they came to visit me out in Ottawa). So, I hope they have a really awesome time down there.</p>

<p>Also, Jari and Seppo should be stepping off a plane any time soon to spend the week up here in Vancouver. These are the two Finnish guys I got loaded with during my last trip, so I'm hoping to return the favour on this side of the world for them. It looks like the Canucks might even be in town for a game while they are here, so we'll definitely try to get tickets, or possibly find the nearest watering hole so they can check it out.</p>
