                <p>In October 2003, <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solar_flare_031028.html">there was a massive release of energy from our sun</a>. The resulting coronal mass ejection (CME) headed straight for our planet, bombarding it with a massive amount of charged particles. The official classification for the flare was an X17.2, which is one of the top three recorded solar flares in the history of our planet.</p>

<p>The charged particles disrupted satellite communications in space, and also lead to auroras being seen as far south as the Chicago. I was fortunate enough to be following the activity while it was happening, and was notified via email (via <a href="http://spaceweather.com">SpaceWeather.com</a>) that auroras might be visible at low latitudes.</p>
<p>At around 4am, I walked upstairs to my rooftop patio in Kitsilano, only to be greeted with one of the most amazing light shows I've ever seen.</p>

<p>The Aurora In Vancouver, October 2003</p>
<p>I was one of the few people who managed to see the entire sky over Vancouver lit up in a glorious array of red and green hues that night. Despite only having a little digital camera at the time, I managed to capture a few shots, several of which ended up on Nasa's website and local television stations. It was a really exciting event, and one of my fondest memories of my time living in Kitsilano.</p>
