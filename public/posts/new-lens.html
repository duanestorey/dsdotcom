                <p>So, today I took the plunge and bought a new lens. I have been debating for a while just which I was going to get: the 24-70 f/2.8L or the 70-200mm f/2.8L. I found some guy in Vancouver who needed to sell his 70-200mm to get some cash, so that basically made the decision up for me. I saved about $500 compared to buying it new. I met him at Richmond center early this morning and did a bunch of test shots near the mall. I had my laptop with me so I could see just what this puppy could do. I was really happy with the shape of the lens (mint), and the pictures that it produced. So, I handed over the cash, and walked away with a new lens.</p>
<p>First, let me just say that all the photos I've seen of this lens really don't do it justice - it's big.. Actually, it's not just big, it's insanely huge. It completely dwarfs the camera body. There's absolutely no way you could walk around with this thing in public and keep a low profile. People will notice. People will stare. It's gonna be strange taking shots with it.</p>
<p>The lens itself weights a few pounds, so it's really heavy. It's so heavy in fact that it has it's own tripod mount on the barrel so that the tripod doesn't tip over when you mount it on the standard camera mount.</p>
<p>I haven't had too much time to play with it yet, but I've added some photos here that I took with it today.</p>
