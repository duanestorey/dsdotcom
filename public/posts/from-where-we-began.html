                <p>So, I was reading my buddy Joey's website when I stumbled across a recent article of his. It shows a video of him riding a bike when he was a kid, and of course, in typical kid fashion, hurting himself. When I saw this, I was reminded of a similar accident I had when I was a kid. My sister tied my wagon onto the back of her bike and was pulling me up and down Wiltshire street in Chilliwack. I was having a great time, probably because I was wearing my bright green boots and my tacky overalls. Out of nowhere, my sister hits the brakes. Unfortunately, the wagon didn't have any way to stop, so I smashed into the back of the bike at a pretty fast speed. I tried to open my mouth to cry, but I then realized that all my top teeth were firmly planted in my bottom lip, and I couldn't really open my mouth. I ran inside as fast as I could, only to have my parents pry my mouth open again.</p>
<p>So without further ado, because Joey's a big success story now making <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/josephcharles/397068125/">Hollywood movies with Amanda Bynes</a> and kickin ass in the internet space, I thought I'd share some of his earlier memories here by showing where he came from. So if you want to check out Joey's crazy bike accident, <a href="http://emuse.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/511">click here.</a></p>
<p>You can <a href="http://surrealsites.com/blog/2007/04/10/becoming-a-semi-famous-internet-star-part-ii/">read the whole article on his website</a>.</p>
<p>** only one kid was hurt in the making of this video</p>
