                <p>I'm such a big fan of Christmas. I don't know why, since most people tend to get a little grumpier, the malls are way busier, traffic is far more hectic -- yet somehow I always tend to get a little happier when my lights are up, or when I see presents under the tree.</p>

<p>The last couple Christmas's have all sort of slipped past me without me really noticing. I guess I was just really busy, but I always found myself in Chilliwack a day or two before Christmas, wondering where in the world December went, and how was it that I didn't remember it. So, today I went out and bought a few small things to make my place a little cheerier. I put up some Christmas lights around my place, cleaned up a bit, and even set up a small tree in the corner. It's not real, but it's does the job and makes my place a little brighter. I even bought some of that fake snow stuff, and I'm a man on a mission looking for things to spray. There's not really going to be any presents under my tree, but it's actually the first tree I've ever had by myself, and I think it's pretty cool.</p>
<p>There are quite a few Christmas parties coming up in the next few weeks, so I'm gonna be pretty busy up until Christmas. But I'm really looking forward to the parties, and the break that's coming up. Even though I haven't really been at work much of the last month, it hasn't really been that relaxful. I'm looking forward to a nice relaxing break over Christmas, and an actual vacation somewhere warm in the New Year. I'm probably gonna be going alone, since all my friends already did theirs, but I'm ok with that. Maybe I'll hit a warm resort somewhere in the Carribean with a suitcase full of books, or maybe I'll try my hand at surfing somewhere in Hawaii. I still have a bunch of healing to do, but I'd like to take a real vacation sometime soon, so we'll see.</p>
