                A while ago I posted about my recent purchase of the Agent 18 Eco-Shield product. I received it via FedEx the other day and have had it on my iPhone ever since. I thought I'd give a quick review of the product.

Agent 18 Eco-Shield
First, I have to say that my primary motivation for purchasing the product was that it is supposed to be made entirely from recycled plastic. The product is indeed made of plastic, and fits my iPhone 3G perfectly (the last case I bought didn't fit properly at all). Un...

                I read this interesting article today that basically said that most people in the United States were only 11 days away from financial ruin. That is, if they were to lose their jobs tomorrow, they only have enough money to last for about 11 days:

More than a third of adults could survive financially for only 11 days if they were to lose their job or be too ill to work, according to a survey.
The finding gives a worrying insight into the lives of millions who are living on a financial tightrope.

                I have lived in Vancouver most of my life. It is a city I hold dear to my heart, but a city that has, over time, grown cold to some of its inhabitants. My daily walk takes me from my apartment near Beach avenue in Vancouver, down across Yaletown, passing near Gastown, and into Vancouver's business district. One thing that has become evident, especially in the last few years, is that the homeless crisis in Vancouver is reaching epidemic proportions, with many people forced to sleep on the street ...

The Wilkins Ice Shelf is experiencing further disintegration that is threatening the collapse of the ice bridge connecting the shelf to Charcot Island. Since the connection to the island in the image centre helps to stabilise the ice shelf, it is likely the break-up of the bridge will put the remainder of the ice shelf at risk. ..

As you can see, my LCD has a wicked crack in it. I did a quick scan in the forums, and replacing an LCD via the Apple store runs about $1000, which is rather insane. Thankfully I found a few companies on eBay that are selling the raw LCD screens for around $200, so I put in an order for a replacement. Hopefully I'll be able to install it myself when it comes in the mail.

                It appears that things are almost back to normal with regards to my blog. I had to juggle the DNS entries around a bit the other day, and that caused a period of time where both versions of my blog existed on the internet for a while. I think for the most part most people will be directed to this one, which is the way it should be.

                On September 12th, 1962, John F. Kennedy took the stage at Rice Stadium, and made one of the most ambitious pledges of any presidency - in less than ten years, the United States would put a man on the moon:

There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation many never come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And th...

Anyways, here is a trailer for season 3 or Heroes. I hope Peter keeps his shirt on for more of it.

They had a really nice (that is, if power supplies can be described as such) $150 one that was on sale for $75, so I went with that. The good news is that my old power supply was basically taxed in terms of connectors, and it would have been impossible to add anything else to it. This new one has an extra 300W of headroom on it, and also 3 more SATA connectors.

                As everyone knows, Rogers announced their lackluster iPhone plans not that long ago, and were immediately criticized by most Canadian wireless customers as being far too expensive. In addition, the lack of an unlimited data plan, a feature that Bell and Telus have for some of their phones, is also fairly disappointing give the web-based nature of the device.
In response to the data rates, RuinediPhone set up an online petition asking Rogers to change their data rates. Since going live nearly a w...

                I've always been a big fan of four day work weeks, or better yet, working at the rate which you are most productive. That's why I have always gravitated towards jobs that don't have fixed hours. Where I currently work, I really don't have a fixed schedule. If I wake up early, I'll stroll in at 8:30am. If I have a rough night sleeping, nobody cares when I stroll in at 10:30am. Given that flexibility, I'll often do a bit of work at home during the evenings when I'm listening to music or whatever.

At the Matthew Good show the other night I ran into a good friend of mine from high school. We ended up chatting and drinking beers over at Doolin's after, and it was great to catch up. Rob and I became friends back when I was working at Bonanza when I was 16, and I haven't talked to him in a few years.

                I do the odd post from time to time on health issues and current research I think is interesting. About a year ago I posted an article discussing how caffeine seems to have a negative influence on the body's insulin signaling, which ultimately affects blood sugar levels in the blood. What this ultimately means is that caffeine might be a major contributing factor in the obesity epidemic, since high insulin levels in the blood promote the storage of fat and make it difficult to burn it.

Whenever I think of Canada Day, I am always reminded of the few years I spent in Ottawa. Out there, Canada day is a day-long party, where they basically shut the downtown core down and let everyone mingle, get their face painted, and for those of you of legal drinking age, have a few street-side beer. At the end of the night there was always a big concert on Parliament Hill.

So by comparison, Canada Day in Vancouver is pretty tame. Last year I got together with some friends and had a few pints...

                Dave summed up the sentiment behind this post with one of his recent Flickr photos:

While most of Canada is ecstatic for the release of the iPhone in Canada, one company seems rather mute about the whole event. Ironically, that company is Rogers, the only company that has the technology to actually bring the iPhone to Canada. As Dave pointed out, the Apple website has been updated to reflect all the available information regarding the iPhone in Canada. Roger's unfortunate marketing campaign inv...

I missed the boat on the first round of Canadian iPhone action last year mainly because I was (quite stupidly) locked into a crazy Bell Mobility contract. The current consensus of the rumour mill is that Apple is gearing up to announce the 3G version of the iPhone on June 9th, which would hopefully put that model into Canadian stores sometime in the near future. I have been patiently awaiting it's arrival so I can call up Bell and tell them where they can shove my phone and my crappy contract.

I've seen a few rumour sites suggest that Apple is preparing to seed developers with an early 10.6 release of their operating system. You can read about it here. If true, it sounds like it's more of a maintenance/stability release, which makes me really wonder why they would name it a 10.6 instead of a 10.5.4. And to be honest, I'd be really disappointed if they were to release 10.6 as a real, full fledged (i.e. you have to pay more money) update to the operating system, considering Leopard isn...

                I got back from Deception Pass early this afternoon, and I have to say, it was a really great trip. I spent most of the time there just sitting around the campfire reading, often taking a sip from a can of beer when my attention wandered from the pages.

I took a little day trip on Saturday, driving back along the water towards Anecortes, and then south towards Oak Harbour. Driving along the open road with the windows open made me realize just how long it has been since I've gotten away for a we...

                Being that this weekend is the May long weekend, and unofficially (at least in British Columbia circles) the start of summer, I thought I might get in the car and take a little road trip. My sister and the kids are camping near Deception Pass in Washington, State, and I'm seriously considering hopping in the car later tonight and making the trek down to hang out with them.

It's supposed to be 30C, which is rather nice weather to be sitting outside. I have to see what the state of my camping gea...

                Tonight was a jam packed night. I left work around 7pm, and then headed down Granville Street, frantically looking for something to eat. I actually walked into Wings, but it was completely full. So eventually I settled on my old-faithful nacho-haven, the Two Parrots. They had a 35 cent wing special on, so I filled up with that.

Eventually I ended up at some Spanish place (coincidentally, it's only one block from my place, and I had never been there) to celebrate Raul's graduation from UBC with ...

                I read an article this morning that made mention of QR codes, and to be honest, I had never heard of them before. After doing some research, it appears that QR codes are essentially two-dimensional bar-codes that are fairly popular in Japan. A user with a camera phone can simply point their phone at a QR code and, assuming it is QR code aware, will decode the symbol.
QR codes can be used to encode URLs, phone numbers, text information, and SMS messages. So you can have an advertisement and simpl...

That abuse eventually led to Megan committing suicide, and sparked a whole series of internet debates about where the fault for something like that lies and how accountable social networks should be for the actions of their users.
Today Facebook announced that they will be implementing over 40 safeguards to help protect its users from sexual predators and online cyberbullying:

Lately, some people have been installing little rick roll blockers, thinking that it somehow protects them from being rick rolled simply because the video no longer plays. My take on that is that it's basically a form of cheating, and that if you clicked the link, you were rick rolled.

                The Amazon EC2 service is a rather revolutionary cloud computing system that came out in late 2006. It provides a fairly flexible infrastructure that allows you to launch application servers on demand. Traditionally new web companies are forced to pay for rather expensive co-location facilities for their servers, with little or not thought given to scalability (which isn't always a bad thing, considering most companies never reach a point where they need scalability).

                Last night was Vancouver's first ever WordCamp down at the Network Hub downtown. I got there about 15 minutes early, and was fairly amazed that it was already standing (or sitting, if you will) room only. There were so many people in fact, that they wrapped around the edges into locations where you couldn't even see the projector. Clearly Vancouver has a very large and supportive WordPress community.

                It's official -- Roger's has made what they call a public statement regarding just that:

TORONTO, April 29 /CNW/ - Ted Rogers, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rogers Communications Inc. today issued the following statement: We're thrilled to announce that we have a deal with Apple to bring the iPhone to Canada later this year. We can't tell you any more about it right now, but stay tuned.

Not very informative, but I guess it dispels the myth that it's not coming. Although, most people...

                I got a call from the accountant this morning, and she said my taxes were all done. I just had to swing by and sign some forms and they would be e-filed.
Before I gave her my taxes, I did a quick trial run myself, just to see what the difference would be. If I were to have filed them, I would have gotten back around $600. Having her do it (and properly take into account all my camera gear), I get about $1800 back. Her fee for doing my taxes was about $160, so that means my net return is $1640, o...

                I've been using Google Reader as my main RSS reader for some time. For the most part, I'm pretty happy with it. They've recently added the ability to share items, which makes it far more interesting.
The one thing I'd love to see though is the ability to add local comments on those shared items, comments that only my friends could see. So many times I've read items in my friends' shared feeds and really wanted to say something, or get clarification. Going to the real site and posting a comment s...

                I was out at Waves Coffee until around 2:10am last night, which was an interesting experience unto itself. The first question I have is for all you ladies -- how come the majority of you are dating dipshits? Pretty much every girl that walked in last night had some idiot guy attached to her. This one in particular reminded me of the typical drug dealer back home -- you know, with the fancy phone, crooked hat, tons of jewelry, and an attitude that just wouldn't quit. The guy had his girlfriend ru...

                I set up a Linux box at home a while ago, mainly so that I'd have a stable place to run my blog. To that end, I installed Centos on it, which is an enterprise grade version of Linux (many hosting companies use it).
The one downside to using Centos is that most of the packages in the repositories are rather old (although they are usually stable). So if you want to stay on the cutting edge, it's fairly hard using this distribution.
