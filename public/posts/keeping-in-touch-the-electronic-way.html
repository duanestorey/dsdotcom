                <p>One of the great added benefits of having an online presence is that it allows people to find me pretty easily and figure out what I've been up to. My parents use it to get a glimpse of the stuff I'm up to living out here in the big city, my friends who have moved away get to see a little picture of home from time to time, and old friends sometimes get a chance to reconnect. Last summer I took a week off and visited New York City for three days, which was really cool. After that, my plan was to load the car with camping gear and head out to Banff and the Rocky Mountains for some rest and relaxation. During my brief stop over in Vancouver, I decided to make sure my blog was still beating, and found a note from my old high school friend Joyce saying that she found me again by Googling me, and that if I were ever out near Calgary, that I should give her a call. So, the fact that I was about two hours away from getting into my car and driving out near Calgary was pretty coincidental, and needless to say a few days later Joyce and I were enjoying drinks and catching up on a patio in Calgary.</p>
<p>And once again, my blog has been a portal to reconnect with old friends. Duncan, an old friend of mine from Chilliwack, dropped me a line via my blog to say hey tonight. I haven't seen him in a very long time, and we used to both nerd out together on the computer back in grade 8 or 9. It's really great when people I haven't heard from in a long time find me that way and reconnect. Another old friend, Mike Marchand, now lives in Vegas and uses my blog to check in on Chilliwack once and a while and see some of the great stuff he's missing by being down south. And I think that's pretty cool.</p>
<p>So, for all you lurkers who are using my mind and computer from time to time, do me a favour and drop me a line someday and let me know who you are. Here's a shot of Duncan and his wife that he sent me tonight.</p>
