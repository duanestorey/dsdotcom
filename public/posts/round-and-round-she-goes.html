                <p>When I left for Chilliwack on the weekend, I accidentally left my phone sitting on my bed back in Vancouver. Considering I was only going for a day, I didn't real think that much of it, and checked my messages from Chilliwack on Saturday night. When I got back to Vancouver yesterday evening, my phone was dead, so I simply plugged it into the wall and went to sleep.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, upon checking my messages today, I realized that I had missed a call yesterday from my plastic surgeon saying that they couldn't perform surgery on Thursday, and that they wanted to bring me in and do it today. By the time I got the message, it was too late to do anything about it. So, I will have to wait at least two weeks for the next round of surgery, possibly even three weeks. Obviously I'm pretty bummed. I really wanted to have it all over with as it's really been bothering me alot lately.</p>
<p>I'm in the process of trying to reschedule, and I'll drop a line here once I have a new date "finalized."</p>
