                <p>Just woke up from another of my nightly after work naps.. I really have no idea why I'm so tired lately. Must be the meds, which are thankfully almost over. I'm going to start packing now for the journey home sometime this weekend, which involves doing laundry and what not.</p>
<p>I'll post something before I take off, and will have my laptop in Chilliwack as well, although I probably won't turn it on that often.</p>
<p>I was really excited that I got three Christmas cards in the mail tonight, but one was actually junk mail disguised as a Christmas card, which wasn't as exciting. Thanks to John and Kirsten, and Jeff and Michele. I'll see some of you guys back in the wack I'm sure.</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>I was originally going to write a going-away holiday entry tomorrow morning, but I did one tonight over at matthewgood.org. <a href="http://www.matthewgood.org/2007/12/the-journey-home/">So head over there and check it out</a>.</p>
