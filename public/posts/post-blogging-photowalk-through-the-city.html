                <p>Today was a good day. I woke up this morning fully refreshed thanks to the 10 or 11 hours of sleep I got last night. I basically had no plans upon waking up, but found a message on my cell phone this morning from <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com">Boris</a> saying that people were meeting up on commercial drive for some brunch.</p>

<p>I hopped in the car and headed down to Havanas on the Drive, which is a pretty funky restaurant/gallery that I've heard good things about. There I met up with about twelve or so people, most of which attended Northern Voice. <a href="http://ma.tt">Matt Mullenweg</a> (now with a +1 from here for his battle against the dancing dude) also swung by for some brunch, and to take his Nikon DSLR for a spin in our city.</p>

<p>We spent the remainder of the afternoon walking around the city, taking little sea taxis, and even grabbing a few drinks down at the Cat's Meow on Granville Island. All in all a really enjoyable day with some good people -- the perfect end to Northern Voice and the weekend.</p>
