                <p>First off, Seattle was a lot of fun, and it was great seeing Dave and Lauren tie the knot. The ceremony was really well done, and the venue was spectacular. I had a really great time there with my friend Lynn and everyone else we met on the dance floor. I haven't been all suited up in a while, so it was nice to dress up for a change. The Alexis Hotel fireplace suite was really posh as well, and it was super nice of them to put me up in it for the weekend.</p>
<p>This morning has been a bit of a bumpy ride. I had a longstanding photography client issue I've been dealing with that I thought was resolved that unfortunately reared up again. Thankfully it appears solved, and I'm hoping I can finally put the last nail in that coffin. I also got a call this morning that my mom was in the emergency ward of the hospital here, and I just got back from visiting her down there. She's fine, but had a bit of a scare there so she went in to be safe. She's just waiting for a few test results, and then she'll hopefully be released.</p>
<p>It's been crazy stormy and windy out here lately. I honestly can't really remember a time when the weather was this nuts. I had to close my window last night simply because the sound of the wind was keeping me awake. I'm not sure what's wrong with my building, but there's a really loud creaking noise in the attic whenever there's a big wind storm. It's loud enough that it wakes me up, so I really haven't been a big fan of the weather out here.</p>
<p>It's down to the wire here. On Wednesday I'm heading into Vancouver and catching a flight to Punta Cana. My flight is at 1am, so it's going to be a long, drawn out red eye flight I imagine (mainly because I have trouble sleeping on planes). There's also a brief stop in Calgary, which means I probably won't get a chance to sleep until after that. The good news is that I'll be on vacation in the Dominican Republic for 14 days at that point.</p>
