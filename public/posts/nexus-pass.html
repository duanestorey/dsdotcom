                <p>About a week ago I went through the formal interview process for my Nexus Border pass. Other than when my friend Dan has been working at YVR, I can't really remember many times I've crossed the border where I didn't feel the border guard was excessively rude. Maybe it's because I always cross the border alone, or maybe there's something weird flagged on my account, but I always seem to get the nth degree.</p>
<p>The interview process was fairly straightforward, until of course they asked if I wanted the card for business or pleasure. I said that while it was primarily for pleasure, I would probably do the odd business trip to meet clients and what not (something I've done with every company I've ever worked with, especially down in the Bay Area). Of course, that response raised a bunch of flags, and before I knew it I was knee deep in providing BraveNewCode information. The guy made me produce business cards, incorporation information, and seemed to consistently go back to questioning about how I got paid (he couldn't seem to accept that I could simply write myself cheques).</p>
<p>The guy then asked for me to prove that I lived at my current (Chilliwack) address, so I showed him my driver's license, which wasn't good enough for him (apparently they can be faked). I then rummaged through my laptop bag, eventually finding a Roger's bill addressed to my Chilliwack address. When I showed it to him, he got upset that I didn't produce it originally, even though I really had no idea I was to bring something of that nature.</p>
<p>The second part of the interview was with a Canadian official, and by comparison, was far more relaxed (she actually smiled and, you know, said please and thank you and stuff). I had my retina scan, and eventually left to go have a few beers with Jay.</p>
<p>My physical Nexus card arrived in the mail today, and unfortunately for me, it seems to have the wrong address associated with it (thank Canada Post for somehow rerouting it to my correct address). Ultimately that means I have to somehow get in touch with US Customs and try to change my address with them, which is something I'm not looking forward to in the least.</p>
