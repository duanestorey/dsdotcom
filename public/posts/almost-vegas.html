                <p>Right now, in Las Vegas, is the huge Blog World Expo. Most of the Vancouver tech-scene is down there, including <a href="http://miss604.com">Rebecca</a>, &amp; <a href="http://blogaholics.ca">Arieanna and Ianiv</a>. Last night I decided to head down this morning and join them until Monday morning, since it looked like they were having such a great time. I actually found a pretty decent flight special late last night, and I booked it for this morning.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when 5am rolled around and I had to get up for the airport this morning, I didn't really feel all that well. Plus, doing six hours worth of plane travel seemed less fun than it did the night before. So anyways, needless to say, I canceled my flight and went back to sleep, waking up shortly before noon.</p>
<p>The good news is that I feel fairly rested today, and am sitting around in my boxers listening to music, making breakfast and drinking coffee. I think I'm just going to stay close to home today and watch some movies. But I almost made it to Las Vegas this weekend, which would have been fun.</p>
