                <p>Yesterday was WordCamp San Francisco, and Rebecca, John Bollwitt, John BIehler, Dale and myself all attended. The night before we thought it was a good idea to sit around and drink margaritas until around 2am, so we were all a bit tired during the event. But it was a great event, and we're all glad we made the trip down.</p>

<p>Several fairly exciting things happened during Matt Mullenweg's <strong>State of the Word Presentation</strong>. First, Matt showed a slide which displayed some of the new profile information that is going to be coming to WordPress.org -- BraveNewCode has actually been helping with that effort, so it was great to finally have some of it shown to everyone. Second, Matt displayed a list of the coolest three WordPress plugins, as voted by people on his Twitter stream. The first plugin that was shown, the third coolest plugin, was actually <a href="http://www.bravenewcode.com/wordtwit">WordTwit</a>. Dale and I were both pretty floored seeing it up there in all it's glory on Matt's slide in front of about 700 people. The second coolest plugin was a related posts plugin. And then, Matt flipped to the number one coolest WordPress plugin, none other than Dale and my <a href="http://www.bravenewcode.com/wptouch">WPtouch</a> iPhone plugin. So, <a href="http://www.bravenewcode.com">BraveNewCode</a> walked away with the #3 and the #1 spots for the coolest WordPress plugins -- a pretty exciting event for us to be sure. So thanks to everyone who voted for us.</p>
<p>Later that night we attended the social down at Automattic's new offices at Pier 38. I had the chance to meet a lot of great people in person, many of which I had only talked to online before. The bar was completely open, so most people did fairly well in the liquor department. Afterwards all of us found a little hole-in-the-wall diner and had a nice greasy meal to close out the evening. I've been really enjoying guacomole lately, and I managed to find a hamburger that had a healthy dose of the stuff on it.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'm going to be making the long journey back home. I'll save the details of that for my next post.</p>
