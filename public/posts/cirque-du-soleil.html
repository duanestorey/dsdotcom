                <p>So last night I had a chance to see my first Cirque du Soleil down at Concorde Pacific with a few friends.. It was pretty wild, and I didn't really know what to expect. I have to say that the highlights for the night were the jugglers and the flipping guys.. It was also really cool to hang out with some of the people that I started university with in 1995 (it was our UBC reunion night... )</p>
<p>Today I woke up and headed over to Dustin and Dori's house to hang out for a few hours.. We walked around and enjoyed some of Kits Day, and then came back to Dustin's (where I am now) for some early-afternoon beer consumption (I'm on #3). Dustin is helping me work on my thesis slides (my defense is Tuesday afternoon). I'm pretty upset that I wasn't smart enough to bring my camera here, since there were lots of cool photo-ops walking around Kits. If anyone is around later, give me a shout on my cell, since I have a feeling there is going to be lots of beer flowing later tonight.</p>
