            <p>My dryer at home basically stopped working a few weeks ago, so I've been rotating ever-so-slowly through my wardrobe. My landlord was going to come by and take a look at it, but I don't think he's been feeling very well lately. So anyways, considering I'm out of clean clothes and I'm out of clean sheets, I decided to take care of it today. So I'm working from home, waiting for a repair guy to come by and fix it up.</p>
<p>While I'm at it, I'm going to rant about people who play the lottery. I got no problem that you want to play 6-49 all day, but please make some decisions before you get to the counter. It seems like all I do lately is wait for people to decide whether or not they want the Extra, as if it was some monumental decision that will affect their future lives.</p>
<p>** update - the dryer is kaput. Needs to be replaced. Going to go buy new clothes tomorrow I guess.</p>
