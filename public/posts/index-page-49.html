If I do watch a movie, I'll probably pop in the extended edition of the Fellowship Of The Ring, since I haven't watched it in ages. What better way to spend your weekend than going on a 12 hour journey into the heart of Middle Earth?

It's a bit premature, as many browsers do not support them, but I thought I'd start figuring out the tricks of tomorrow's trades.
It's just a bit of CSS magic, along with a true-type font on the server. The browser downloads the TTF an...

One of the best uses of QR codes in my mind involves the inclusion of QR code hyperlinks in printed media. That way a user could be reading a poster or a paper version of an article and still be able to navigate hyperlinks using their...
