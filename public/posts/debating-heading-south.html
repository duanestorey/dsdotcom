                <p>So yesterday I was sitting on my patio trying to figure out when to take a vacation. I still have a few small client-related items to finish off, so I've been waiting around for that. While going over everything in my head though I remembered that because I work from a laptop, there's really no reason why I can't work remotely. All I need is an internet connection once and a while to check email, and I'm basically golden.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I'm thinking about testing my Nexus pass out in the next few days and heading south. Pretty much every KOA nowadays has free Wi-Fi, so I could easily do a bunch of work while camping on the coast. Given that I have some friends in Seattle and Portland, I'm debating loading my camping stuff and a guitar in the car and leisurely making my way down to Oregon, camping along the way and doing some work next to various KOA pools.</p>
<p>It's only about a three hour drive from my place to a little KOA south of Seattle, so that would probably be my first stop. I've always wanted to see Mount St. Helens as well, so I definitely want to check that out on my way to Portland.</p>
<p>I'm still toying everything over in my head, but so far I think that's what I might do. I'll probably wait another day or two to wrap a few more things up on my end and figure out who will water my plants, but after that I'd like to hit the road and have a bit of relaxation time.</p>
