                <p>Yesterday Apple released their long-waited for SDK for the Apple iPhone and iPod Touch. What this means is that if you're interested in developing applications for the iPhone, you can simply download the SDK and get cracking. That is, unless you live in Canada.</p>
<p>That's right, Steve Jobs has limited real development to people with valid US addresses. And even then, it's an application process that costs a minimum of $99 to be a part of. I realize Canada is a really small demographic compared to the United States, but we're not *that* small, and there really are some bright people up here. I had a friend download the SDK last night, and sure enough, until you get approved you can't digitally sign any of your applications, which ultimately means you can't install them on any real devices. I'm reminded of my Apple TV sitting in the other room which does not have the ability to view rented movies in Canada yet. It's fairly clear that Canada is just an afterthought to all the decisions that go on down south.</p>

<p>Why do you do this to us Steve? Why is our love sauce not as sweet? You guys admitted a few weeks ago that <a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/2008/03/americans-suck-at-sex/">Canadians are better lovers</a>, so why do you keep hurting us when you know we only want to be with you?</p>
<p>I'm sure there will be ways to circumvent that if you're in Canada and you *really* want to release an application. But part of the appeal is that Apple is going to do a revenue share of these applications using iTunes. So if you make an application, Apple will mass sell it for you and you'll get a fraction (I think around 70%) of the profit.</p>
<p>Apple also mentioned a $100 million dollar fund for cool iPhone ideas and/or applications. Only catch is you have to be an American.</p>
<p>Come on Steve. Time to show Canada some love.</p>
