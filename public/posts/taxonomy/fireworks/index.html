                    This is one of my favourite shots. I took it down at the Celebration of Light two years ago. It was my first real time shooting fireworks with my camera. Unfortunately, I didn't have a tripod, so I basically experimented all night with settings that would allow me to handhold a fireworks shot. I ended up with a few keepers, but a lot of the ones I shot ended up being a bit blurry (which is why a tripod is usually preferable).

There are fireworks here in Vancouver tonight, but right now it's a bit rainy. So we'll see how things look around 10:05pm when the first few go off. ...

                    I doubt that this year I'll be able to watch any of the fireworks, but in previous years I've tried to catch at least one fireworks display. Strangely enough, you'd think I would have seen them all, given how I lived right on the corner of Beach and Howe in Vancouver for three years.

I have lots of memories of the fireworks, but my favourite memory, and a story I tell often, involves some heartache and a beer. I had just broken up with my ex-girlfriend, and was feeling a bit blue. So my friend Dustin came to hang out, and we decided to see the fireworks. Since we had a few hours to kill, we grabbed ...

                    I live right near English Bay, and right now most of Vancouver is gathering outside my front door to see the second night of the fireworks. As a kid, seeing the fireworks was something I used to really enjoy. But as an adult, I don't really enjoy large crowds anymore, or fighting to get a spot to sit. That being said, I appreciate that the event brings a lot of people together from various parts of Vancouver, and the Fraser Valley.
Last year, our good pal Tony was visiting Vancouver, and we all got to hang out, drink a few beers, and watch the fireworks together. And while we didn't make it to ...

                    Tony Pierce is currently in town checking out some of the Canadian sights and trying his hand at drinking Canadian beer. Tonight Tony, Robyn, Rebecca, John, Keira, Adam and Corinna all came down to my place for some pre-fireworks drinking.

I wasn't up to my typical drinking self, but I still managed to demolish 6 or 7 beers in fairly short order. I didn't really eat any type of supper, so I'm a bit hungry now. On Friday some of us are going to meet up after work for a longer version of tonight, with hopefully a larger group.

It was a cool night though, and it is the first time since owning my ...
