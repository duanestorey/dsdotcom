A while ago Epson asked me if I'd like to take their relatively new Epson Stylus Pro 3880 printer for a spin. Since I'm obviously into photography and the printer can easily accommodate colour prints, I thought it would be fun to test it out to see what it could do.
First of all, I should say that this is a BIG printer. When the courier arrived to drop it off you could tell he was having a hard time moving it. Once it was in my apartment, it basically blocked the entire front door. Being a typical bachelor I of course left it blocking the door for the majority of the evening, but eventually decided ...

                    A few months ago, Darren Barefoot put up a proposal on his blog asking for west-coast bloggers to review a few Brother printers. Since I love getting my hands on new technology, and have never really used a color laser printer before, I signed up for the challenge.
 Brother Printer for Review
A few weeks later the Brother HL-4050 CDN Printer arrived at my office place. First of all, let me just say that nothing could have prepared me for not only how big the box was, but also how insanely heavy it was. I seriously had a hard time moving it from the front door over to the spare desk next to me.

That's ...

                    So a while ago Darren posted on his blog that Brother was looking for a few west coast bloggers to potentially review a printer or two. Considering I take a ton of photos and ultimately end up printing a pile of them out, I thought it might be a good opportunity to test out a fairly nice printer from Brother.

Well, this big boy showed up at work today, and once I figure out just how in the world I'm going to get it home, I'll test it out and see what it can do. I plan to try printing out a bunch of my artwork to see how it performs in that capacity, as well as a few other tests with the card ...
