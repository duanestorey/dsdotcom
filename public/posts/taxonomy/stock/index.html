                Stock is one of those things that seemed magical before I made it. I had purchased a few cooking books, and many recipes said to use 'vegetable stock', 'chicken stock', 'beef stock', or 'fish stock'. At that time I was used to buying bouillon cubes to take the place of stock, but decided at some point to try making a homemade stock.
Not only is making stock at home easy, but it's a simple way to use up leftover pieces of vegetables and bones. I've grown accustomed now to making a chicken dinner ...

I've gone through various mutual fund companies and financial planners over the years, but ultimately decided last year to take my finances into my own hands and manage my own portfolio.
My main issue with the financial planning/advice market is that there is an inherent conflict of interest in most of the advice given out. Yes, a par-life plan may in fact be a great investment vehicle, but when your purchase of one results in a $1,000 bonus for the financial planner, how can anyone ever be sur...

I first started investing in the stock markets around 2000. Since then, I've had front row seats to at least two big market corrections. During the first, I was working out at JDS Uniphase in Ottawa, Ontario. If that name sounds familiar, you probably heard about us on the news -- in 2001, JDS Uniphase wrote-off the largest amount of goodwill in history, a staggering $45 billion dollars. When I showed up for work that day, news trucks were lined up all down the block, and employees were being c...

                I've been reading a lot of food/cooking related books lately. No real reason, just haven't had too much else around to read. I actually stumbled across an 1,100 page culinary manual on the internet a while ago, and have slowly been absorbing it. In addition, I've been passively thumbing through various cookbooks I have around the house looking for dishes to try making over the next few months.
Last night I made myself a little roasted chicken for thanksgiving and watched a few movies by the fire...
