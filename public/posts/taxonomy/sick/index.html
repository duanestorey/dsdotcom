                I haven't written on here in a few days now. That's a long stretch for me. Truth is, I'm just kind of busy and a bit bagged. I haven't been sleeping all that well lately, and feel like I'm a walking zombie. I was feeling pretty nauseous all yesterday, and didn't really eat that much. I hardly slept at all last night and woke up feeling like I was going to throw-up, so I decided to work from home today and try to save what's left of my body here.
I decided a few weeks ago that I'm taking this wee...

                Back at it again. Now that the Junos are over, I'm basically full swing back into the daily grind. I have an interesting optimization problem at work that I'll write about at some point (from the perspective of how to speed up compilation of a project), but other than that, it's just business as usual.
I started getting a tickle in my throat yesterday which has somehow exploded into a full-on sore throat today. So, while I'm at work, I feel like I'm on the verge of getting sick. It's most likely...

                I woke up to my phone ringing basically non-stop thanks to Hesty and Sean at work. There's a big career fair out at UBC today, and I guess they are all going and wanted me to go too. I woke up with a nasty sore throat though, so I'm going to leave the recruiting to those guys.
I'm going to pass around a bit of link-juice this morning. First, we have Rebecca and Keira, who are packing up and heading to the island for some licking and snowboarding.

That means John is currently wifeless, so I thin...

                I nearly went into work today, but still felt a bit under the weather this morning and decided to rest a bit more. So tomorrow, I'm going to head into work and see if I can pull off a full day. I tried to go to the clinic tonight for a check-up, but there was over a two hour wait, so I'm going to try again in the morning on my way to work.
Also, this weekend I'll be attending Mike and Kim's wedding as the primary photographer, which is both exciting and a bit stressful. It's not hard to grab a c...

                Last night I was released from St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver to continue the healing process at home. I won't make this a long entry becuase frankly, I find it physically rather hard to type and concentate for writing emails and things right now.
The whole episode that led me to head to the hospital is as follows. On Saturday night I was finding myself really short of breath at home. Plus, no matter what medication I took, I just couldn't seem to get my fever to come down. I hit a point when ...

                Friday morning, I woke up with a rather large fever, and spent the first hour or two hugging a toilet. I was feeling pretty defeated, so I called my mom out in Chilliwack and asked her to come out and spend the night with me.
It's been really great. They made me a meal, looking after me, did my laundry, and tried to do what they could to make me feel better. I went to bed, and actually had a pretty decent sleep. Unfortunately, I had a really large fever upon waking up today, and realized that so...

                After work, I was feeling a bit tired so I laid down for a quick nap. When I woke up a few hours later, not only did I have a wicked headache, most of my joints hurt too. I've since turned the heat up in my apartment to around 28C, and I'm still shivering on the couch with some blankets on.
The next couple days are pretty busy for me, so I can't really afford to be sick. I'm going to head to bed now and hopefully wake up at a reasonable hour. My cute maid is coming again in the morning -- so exc...

                I normally have an immune system of steel. Not only is it pretty rare that I get sick, but when I do it normally doesn't last too long. In fact, I don't think I've taken more than three sick days in my entire life, and one of them was faked way back in high school.
However, I am now officially a full week into being sick with seem weird virus, and while I no longer seem to be getting worse, I've been stuck at the "pretty darn sick" alert level for a few days now, and it's getting tiresome. I wak...

                Good news is that I'm back home, awake, and compared to how I felt yesterday morning, doing relatively ok in terms of my lungs and joints. I'm still sick, and I have next to zero lung capacity, but I feel like I've stabilized at least.
But here's the bad news -- I can hardly hear a thing out of my left ear. I was joking with Jason when I landed last night that my ears hurt so bad that I probably blew an ear drum while landing. At the time, I was having trouble hearing, and I thought I just neede...

                I woke up this morning feeling even worse than I did when I went to bed last night, so I bit the bullet and changed my flight -- I'll be coming home later this evening. If I'm to get any more sick, I definitely want it to be back in Canada where I can hit a clinic up and not have to worry about costs or insurance. I'm pretty sure I have health insurance down here through my work insurance, but I can't imagine the hassle with trying to actually use it.
