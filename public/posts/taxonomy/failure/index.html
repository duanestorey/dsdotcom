                About two years ago I decided I would test out Media Temple's grid service package, mainly because it was highly recommended by WordPress users, and seemed to perform quite well.

                About six weeks ago, the CD player in my 2006 Mazda 3 Sport crapped out. Given that it's a new car, and that I purchased the stupid extended warranty (thanks to my lack of a backbone and the high pressure sales guy they put on me), I went in and asked them to replace it for free, which they did.
