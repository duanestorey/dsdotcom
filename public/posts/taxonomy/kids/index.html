                I was just reading an article about a restaurant in Carolina Beach that no longer tolerates screaming kids inside the restaurant. Obviously it's a bit controversial, at least because they are making their policy public. But I wanted to see what everyone else though.
As far as I'm concerned, I have no problem with it at all. I understand that kids will be kids, but if your kid is having a really bad day, then I don't see why everyone else in the restaurant has to have a crappy meal because of it. It's one thing to when a newborn is fussy, because they don't know any better. But I think it's completely ...

                While I don't have any kids of my own, what I do have are a really great niece and nephew that I love very much:

Despite not really spending much time with them over the last ten years (mostly because I lived in a different city), I'm actually fairly close to both of them, and have really been enjoying my time with them since moving back to Chilliwack. Last night my niece gave me a phone call and told me about all of the boy crushes she had while at summer camp (count 'em people, 11 boy crushes).
So this post is dedicated to all the kids in everyone's lives, and how special they all are. Feel ...

                I've been in Chilliwack close to two months now. It's obviously a completely different lifestyle out here, one that I'm quite enjoying. I wake up every morning to an apartment that's filled with light, and I go to sleep each night without the sound of loud sirens or drunken idiots screaming outside.
But without a doubt there's one aspect of living out here that still seems unnatural -- seeing children outside. Living in the downtown core of Vancouver you don't really see a lot of kids. Sure, you see the odd infant, or on the weekend, a few kids going to the aquarium or what-not. But it was pretty ...
