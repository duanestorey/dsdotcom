                    About six months ago I got it into my head that I wanted to play around with RSS technology and see if I could come up with something cool with it. That eventually turned into a standalone RSS reader I wrote for the Mac called TrollDigger. The one feature everyone liked is the ability to view the actual pages instead of the RSS excerpts. I haven't touched it since then, and the version that's currently available for download is a bit clunky, but I was thinking about spending a few hours on it this weekend.
To be honest, lately I've been thinking about a completely GUI-less RSS reader. I'd like ...

                    In the last year I've attempted, on several occasions, to put together a few internet-type sites that interest me. Unfortunately, I haven't really gotten that far with any of them, mainly due to lack of time and an underestimation of the time involve for these projects by me.
So, instead of completely adandoning some of them, I'm going to put out a call for help on a few and see if there's any interest in teaming up to finish a few of these off.
