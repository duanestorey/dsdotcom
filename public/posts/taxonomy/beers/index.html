                    I just got back from a little walk around Palermo Soho. It's about 32C right now, and it sure is a nice change to wear shorts and a t-shirt compared to the rain and cold gear I had on back home.
Without further ado, here's a little video I shot today with my new HD Kodak Playsport:
I spent yesterday trying to get a SIM for my cell phone down here. I basically walked all the way from Palermo Soho to Recoleta, which took me about 45 minutes each way. It was quite the adventure, and it's still not quite over. I'll post more about the cell phone situation once there's a bit of resolution to it.
Truthfully ...

                    My mom reminded me tonight that at this time in exactly two weeks, I'll no longer be in Vancouver. The time sure has gone quickly. I actually get the keys to my new apartment on the 15th, so I might head out on the night of the 14th and grab them in person.
I've been slowly organizing things in my current apartment, and strangely enough, I really don't have that much stuff here. I'll probably load up my car on the 14th with all my valuables and drive those out to Chilliwack myself. I also need to find my Shaw cable modem, which apparently I'm to bring back to Chilliwack for them to reactivate. ...

                    Wow, that seems like a title from 24. Anyways, Ryland Haggis was by tonight for a few beers, which was definitely cool, since we've been talking about it for a while now. For those of you who don't know Ryland, he's an extremely talented photographer who also happens to be an amazing bass player -- he's currently in Jessie Farrell's band, and has been touring with her this last year.

If you haven't heard of him, go add him on Twitter, or also check out his professional musician website.
Also, make sure to check out Jessie's website -- Jessie's currently down in Nashville writing some of her next ...

                    My birthday is fast approaching, and the only real event I'm looking forward to is having a plate of nachos somewhere in the city with a friend or two. So, my question to all of you is: where are the best nachos in this city?
My favourites so far are probably the ones down at Smiley O'Neils on Pender, but I'm open to suggestions. Drop a comment if you've had nachos somewhere in the city and let everyone know how they were (if they sucked, say so).
I had nachos last night down at the Atlantic Trap and Gill, and the beef on them was actually a cut-up hamburger patty -- not cool people. Not cool. ...

                    Not much new to report. Work is going fairly well, and I've met most of our Ontario company now. Derek and I hit "downtown" Kanata and hit a few local establishments tonight, which was actually a lot of fun. I have two more days here, and then I get on a plane and head to Toronto for Matt's concert. I'm actually getting pretty excited about the whole ordeal. I talked with Tony briefly tonight and he's in the same hotel as me, which is cool.

The next time I probably blog will be in Toronto, a few hours before the pre-show meet-up. ...
