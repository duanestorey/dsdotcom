                    One of the most impressive geological formations in the world are the Cliffs of Moher located in County Claire, Ireland. Located approximately an hour drive away from Galway, it's an easily accessible location in the beautiful Burren region of Ireland, which has an eerie resemblance to a moonscape.

I visited the Cliffs once in 2011, but unfortunately it was foggy and didn't make for very nice photos. Thankfully I got a chance to go back again yesterday and got to see the Cliffs of Moher with much better sunshine this time. If you're going to visit the Cliffs of ...

                    I've been blogging a fair deal about my upcoming trip to New York City, and how one of the highlights for me is undoubtedly going to be visiting B&amp;H Photo in New York City. B&amp;H is an extremely well known photography store, and it's been on my list of places to visit for many years now.

Thanks to the power of the Internet, Hershel Waldner, Supervisor of the Online Marketing Department for B&amp;H Photo, contacted me and asked if I'd like a private tour of the facilities while I'm there. Obviously, I said yes!
So, I'll be visiting B&amp;H Photo while I'm in town and also getting a full ...

About a week ago, Gus, Russ and I were talking about how we would all like to visit Uruguay at some point on our adventure. There are two options that most people consider: a trip to Colonia, or a trip to Montevideo.
Due to time constraints, most people end up taking the trip to Colonia, since it's not very far from Buenos Aires. Getting to Montevideo takes more time, and is generally more expensive, so most people choose not to do it. Since it is the capital of Uruguay, we decided that it was the place that we wanted to visit the most.

                    On Friday night a bunch of us from work took Jari and Seppo out for one last night on the town in Vancouver. Since we basically accomplished everything we set out to do this week, we started drinking at around 4pm Friday afternoon at work. From there, we made our way to the Yaletown Brew Pub for dinner and some more drinks. I wasn't really sure what these guys would like to see (apparently at the end of the night it turns out they kind of wanted to see a strip club, affectionately called "The Titty Bar" in Finnish), so I sort of did a mini pub crawl with them. After YBC, we decided to hit up Glowbal ...
