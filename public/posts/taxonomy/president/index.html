                I saw this featured on a news program this morning, and thought it was pretty cool. It's a website where they track the progress of all of Barack Obama's campaign promises and see how he's doing on the Obameter. Check it out....

It's been a few days now since president-elect Barack Obama won the election, and I thought I would share a few thoughts. The day of the election I saw an interview with a prominent African American on CNN who said that should Obama win, you would literally be able to divide the history of the United States into two time periods: the period before Obama, and the period after. He said from that moment on, you would no longer be able to say that certain things were not possible in the US if you w...

                On September 11th, 2001, I was working in the middle of a clean room in a tiny building somewhere in the middle of Ottawa. Upon walking down the hall, I learned from a co-worker that a plane had just struck the World Trade Center. Thinking it was just an accident, I continued on with my job without any more thought to the event. Upon learning that another plane had hit the second World Trade Center building less than an hour later, I began to realize the magnitude of the day's events.
A few hour...

                It's finally here. After over a full year of campaigning, tomorrow the United States will be voting on who will be the next president of the United States. As I've blogged about many times before, I'm hoping Barack Obama wins. Compared to most politicians in this day and age, he seems upfront, humble, intelligent, and with an honest desire to improve the state of America.
I'm probably going to hole myself up tomorrow near a TV and watch the coverage as it happens. Without a doubt, this is bound ...
