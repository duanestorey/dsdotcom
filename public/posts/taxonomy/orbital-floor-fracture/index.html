                    Just got a call from Vancouver General Hospital. Turns out in just a few weeks I'll get the privilege of relaxing inside a big metal tube for an hour down in the MRI clinic. Apparently I can wear my own clothes, as long as there isn't any metal on them at all. Otherwise the metal will probably rip out and go crazy in the huge magnetic fields.

The good news is that MRI's don't use radiation, which means my super powers will probably not be affected this round (I figure with all the CT scans and X-rays I had last year, I've had my share).
Should be a fun time, staring at the inside of a tube while ...

Based on some recent measurements I had done, my surgeon proposed four courses of action:

Do nothing
Remove a bit of skin from eyelid on my "good" eye to make it sort of match the appearance of my "bad" eye
Adjust the eyelid of my "bad" eye to make it better match my "good" eye.
Open me back up and either adjust the current implant, augment it ...

                    This is a pretty important week in the life of Duane. On Tuesday I'll meet up with my plastic surgeon which might potentially be the last meeting I have with him regarding this whole affair. My first meeting was about twelve months ago and resulted in two surgeries to my eye socket. I've spent this last year bouncing between doctors offices, getting eye exams, several CT scans, and will meet this week to probably wrap everything up.
In terms of my vision, it's still not perfect. I see pretty much everything perfectly below the midline (i.e. looking straight or down), but as I look up I tend to ...

                    Today I had a specialist appointment to fully quantify the damage to my vision from my accident last year. The appointment was about an hour of waiting in the waiting room, twiddling my thumbs, and an hour of experiments. They were forced to dilate my eyes, which means not only am I totally sensitive to light right now, but I'm having a very hard time reading anything.

Not sure the verdict, but it's looking pretty likely that my double vision in my upgaze is probably permanent. I can potentially compensate for this by changing my eyeglass prescription to have a slight upward taper in the lens, ...

It's really weird being on campus in the summer.

                    As of this moment, I am officially "on call" for my next surgery at St. Paul's hospital. I was hoping that I would have gotten the call on Sunday night for a Monday morning surgery (I just want it over with), but unfortunately I still haven't had the call yet. I won't be able to eat for twelve hours prior, so I'm pretty much guaranteed to get at least that much notice. It would be nice if they could give more notice than that, but apparently the hospitals are rather busy, and it's difficult to book them in advance.

                    Ever since my injury in November, I have spent quite a bit of time in hospitals, doctor's offices, and medical clinics. Part of those visits usually involves some interaction with medical students.
And while I'm certain that there really are good medical students out there who are passionate about helping people and eager to learn more in their field, almost every single medical student I've encountered has been both arrogant and misinformed, a deadly combination when you're trying to help people who are sick or have undergone significant trauma.

                    I met with my plastic surgeon this morning, and as I thought, we're going to go ahead and do another surgery. The apparent source of my problem seems to be that the ledge that was supporting the implant ended up not being very stable, and the implant has collapsed slightly along with my eye. Also, there is slight herniation of some of orbital contents into my sinus near the back, which is most likely the source of my double vision.
The good news is that it should be nearly 100% fixable. They are going to put in another larger implant, and probably secure it using microscrews (sounds so exciting ...

What this basically meant is that there was little to no support for my left eyeball in my left socket. That was November 4th.
On November 22, I went in for plastic surgery to correct the defect under my eye and put my eye back to its proper position. They do this by sticking in a plastic sheet that is meant to hold the ...

However, apparently the CT scan shows that the bottom muscle of my eye is depressed into the silastic implant that was put in back in November.
