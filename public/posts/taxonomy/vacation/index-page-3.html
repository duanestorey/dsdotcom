                I managed to convince the hotel staff to give me a room at around 10:30am yesterday, which meant I could finally grab a few hours of sleep. I woke up close to 3pm, which meant I only had an hour or so before I had to head down to Manotick for the wedding rehearsal. I did a quick tour of downtown Ottawa with the time I had, took a few photos, and then got picked up by Alison.
Afterwards, we all headed down to Collenade Pizza about one block from where I used to live in Ottawa. Thirty of us procee...

                So, after work tonight I hit the bar with a few of the guys from work.. I feel great. I haven't been this exciting about anything in a long time. I am pretty excited to see Ottawa again, the Byward Market, the Ottawa River, Parliament, and of course, my friends Rob and Anna.
Packing and leaving on a plane are always a bit stressful for me, partially because I am sort of afraid of flying, but in this case, given that I'm gone for nearly two weeks, I was worried I had forgotten a few things. I nea...

                Tonight I went down to the Urban Fare in Yaletown to get a few BBQable items. I figured the trip itself would probably only take 30 minutes or so, since I knew exactly what I was going to pick up. As soon as I put my car into the parkade, I reached into my pocket to pull out my wallet, only to realize it wasn't there. Since I'm less that 48 hours away from getting on a plane, the thought of not having access to any of my bank cards or visa was a bit scary at that moment.
I rushed back to my apar...

                Well, my dad is officially on vacation right now, and I'm only a few days behind him. It seems weird that in just four more days I'll be getting on a plane and disappearing for nearly two weeks. The next couple days are likely to be extremely busy. I have to get some new clothes and sandals for the beach, and also get my place cleaned up and my bags packed.
Hurricane Dean is hitting Jamaica pretty hard right now, and is supposed to head towards Mexico next, so it's likely it will be completely g...

The Caribbean
All You Can Drink
A Topless Beach
Adults Only
Three Pools
Six Bars
Sandy Beach
Dominican Republic
All Night Dancing
The "Boob" Cam

If you guessed me, then you're right. In about 13 days, I'll be hitting the beach of the Dominican Republic, enjoying the sun, warmth and liquor of an adults only, all inclusive resort in the middle of the Caribbean. If there's enough interest, I'll set up a daily iChat from the pool bar for those people wh...

I'll be taking the red-eye, (which I swore last time I'd never take again, since I rarely sleep on planes, and that's basically the whole point of the red-eye) and will get into Ottawa sometime early in the morning on the 24th of August. From there, I imagine I'll head to my hotel, which is only a few steps from the Supreme Court of Canad...

This trip, however, promises to be a lot more interesting, and hopefully more relaxing. The only real things that I have on my plate are my friend's wedding, a trip down to Toronto to see a few people, and then a visit to Quebec City (since I never spent any time there whe...

On my way back from my big walking adventure, I saw a pub called "The Blarney Stone" and basically had to stop by to have one drink out of honour of my home town. While sitting at the pub, I tried my first (and probably last) Strongbow beer. If you haven't had one, you definitely should at least once.. It sort of tastes like apple juice on steroids.
It was here that I ran into Sara and Alec and started my drinking adventure of the evening. I had ma...

I felt a little hungover, but nothing compared to the morning before back in YVR. I thought about showering, but my I-need-to-get-the-hell-out-of-the-hostel-as-soon-as-possible thought process eventually won.
