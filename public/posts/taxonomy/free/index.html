                Over the past few years I've flown to many exotic destinations New Zealand, Brazil, and even Peru. Normally those trips would costs thousands of dollars, but I managed to do all three trips for free thanks to several of my travel reward credit cards.
Most seasoned travellers already know this, but many credit card companies offer travel products that help their customers earn free travel. For every purchase you charge to your credit card, the credit card company will give you a credit for future...

I've been working on a travel eBook for a few months now, mostly on airplanes and during the odd evening. It's been slow going since I have a lot of other things going on right now, but I've managed to make a bit of progress each week. I'm pleased to announce that last night I managed to put the finishing touches on it, and it's now officially available.
My travel ebook contains two main topics: how you can make and execute plans for long-term travel (anything more than a week or two), and how ...

                I've been bouncing around Galway for a week now, and one thing that surprises me compared to a lot of other countries I have visited is how hard it is to find free WiFi. Lots of places seem to offer it on the internet, but when you actually show up to use it you typically only get 20 minutes for free via BitBuzz or Boingo. As someone who typically works remotely as I am travelling, 20 minutes just doesn't cut it.

                I set out to create some free Facebook header images the other day based on the eight months of travel I did in 2011. While I've customized them a bit further, I thought I would release these basic versions in case anyone else would like a new header.

                Since I'm a new Mac convert, I thought I'd give a little back to the Mac community by creating a few free desktop backgrounds based on some of my HDR work.
