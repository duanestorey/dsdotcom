                    The company where I currently work is currently offering a draw for at least one Nintendo Wii (more if I remember correctly). To be eligible, they are asking people to fill out a quick survey to get a bit of data with regards to telecommunications. Everyone reading this blog should be eligible.

So, if you'd like to potentially win a Nintendo Wii, I'd ask if you guys could please fill out a five minute survey.
If you're just a regular person (i.e. not a business owner), please fill out this version.
If you're a small to medium sized business owner, please fill out this one.
Also, please drop a ...

                    A few months ago I had an offer on my website to send a few people some free photo prints. Due to my hospitalization and recent health battles, I never got around to mailing any of them out. Thankfully, I found some time tonight to put a bunch of them together, and they will be going out in the mail.

Unfortunately, not all the people who were supposed to receive one sent me their address, so I still have some to send out. If you were pretty sure you were receiving one, can you please fire me off an email with your address and which print you wanted? Thanks.
Also, once these are all out of the ...

                    Lately at work I've been doing a few statecharts for things, so I thought I would repost the one I made last year that I did while completely bored last year. There's a cool program ("cool" being an extremely relative notion in this instance) you can get called graphviz that can create these things fairly quickly.

                    As I mentioned yesterday, I have launched a photography website at photography.duanestorey.com. I'm going to give the first 20 people who link to it with a small write-up a free 8x12 of their choosing from the galleries. So, if you're interested, do a quick blog entry and then post a comment here. Send me an email with which one you want and where you want it sent to, and I'll take care of the rest.
Thanks everyone.
** UPDATE - Thanks to everyone for linking. With the emails and comments here I've received, I'm pretty sure I have more than 20. So while I appreciate all incoming links should you ...

                    On May 5th, Flickr is having a big world-wide event were everyone is being asked to record a day of their life in photos. I think this is a pretty cool idea, and it should make for some really interesting browsing when it's all over. Unfortunately for me, May 5th will probably involve mostly sleeping and chewing pain killers, but I'm definitely going to try and participate if I can. ...
