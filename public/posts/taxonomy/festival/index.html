                    Blog traffic is pretty low, even by weekend standards. So I can only assume that everyone's out enjoying the long weekend. I'll keep this post short for now.
We all had a rather crappy sleep last night, so we're a bit tired. We went down to the main stage early in the morning and managed to catch a few artists doing sound check. Here's a quick shot of Sarah McLachlan.

Here's a quick video I took of sound check. It's not finished converting yet, but head over and take a look. ...

                    Arieanna and I spent this afternoon walking around the festivities. Today is basically the warm up for tomorrow, so it was rather relaxed. We spent time bouncing between beer gardens and the second stage, the latter of which had various talent performing throughout the day.
Ianiv took the ferry this afternoon, and will be getting here shortly. Arieanna and I sweet-talked our way onto the fireworks barge later, so we'll have press access for that as well. I haven't really taken photos since the Junos, so today was a good warm up day for me. Here are a few shots I took:
