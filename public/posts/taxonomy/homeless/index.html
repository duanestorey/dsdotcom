Today marks the two week mark before I'm officially homeless. It's the first big milestone for my adventure, and I'm looking forward to finally hitting that point. I have about 80% of my apartment boxed up, with only the kitchen to go. I'll slowly box up the remainder this week, and hopefully start transferring everything into storage next weekend.

                    I saw this over on Matt's blog and thought I should write about it too. Captured on digital film is the Vancouver police department tossing a pile of someone's belongings into a garbage truck.
