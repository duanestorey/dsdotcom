                    My walls in my new place are still pretty bare, and that's something I've been trying to fix lately. I went down to Ikea a few weeks ago a bought a pile of frames, but unfortunately finding anything to put in them has proved to be fairly difficult.
The first problem is that I don't really have great photo backups of shots I've taken. If I were smart, I would have been uploading everything to Flickr at full resolution so I could use that as my archive. Unfortunately, I haven't done that, so most of my photo originals are scattered amongst various DVDs and directories. I've always found iPhoto and ...

                    I've been messing around a bit more with photoshop in the evenings, and one day soon I'll read the huge 1000 page book I have on it as well. Here's something I was messing with a bit last night. It's a shot from my patio looking easy towards Yaletown. The bridge is the Granville Street Bridge.
