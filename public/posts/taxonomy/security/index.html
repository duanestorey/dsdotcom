It's been a long time since I did a technology post, but I've recently had security on my mind and thought I would give a quick primer for SSL. For those of you who don't know, SSL stands for secure socket layer, and is the technology on the internet that makes all eCommerce and web security possible. And here's how it works.
First, you need to understand the two different types of encryption.
Symmetric Encryption
Symmetric encryption is any encryption that involves one key and can be decoded i...

                Ever since I was about 18 years of age, I have had a credit card. The main reason, at least at first, was simply to build up a credit rating in case I ever needed a loan (which I ended up requiring when I went to university). Nowadays, I use my visa primarily for work expenses, since I tend to do a lot of traveling with my job.
To that end, I probably spend close to $30,000 on my visa a year, a good portion of which comes from plane rides and hotel rooms when I'm on the road. I have no idea what...

                I wanted to pen this entry really quick before bed. A few days ago, one of the main encryption keys for the HD-DVD platform was leaked, apparently by an insider within the video industry. Basically, having this key will allow anyone with access to the hardware the full ability to decode and decrypt every HD-DVD that has been manufactured so far. Oops.
The key, which amounts to no more than a 128 bit string, has been circling the internet, pulling a string of cease and desist orders along with it...
