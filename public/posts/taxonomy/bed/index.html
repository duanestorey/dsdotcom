                    It seems like it's been raining out here forever. Maybe it's because I spend so much time at home lately, and I can constantly hear the little pitter-patter of raindrops on the rooftop vents. Regardless, it's making me more and more excited to be on the beach in about seven days now.
Tomorrow I'm taking it pretty easy since it's a stat holiday. That said, we're going to push out some quick updates for WordTwit and WPtouch which should hopefully allow the two to start working together. If you use WordTwit, WPtouch will soon be able to show all your recent Tweets. It should be a pretty cool addition, ...

                    I don't do it very often, mainly because my fingers are not iPhone friendly, but i have the wordpress iPhone app which allows me to blog from anywhere pretty much. So here I am in bed, working my iPhone.
Today was a long day, and tomorrow will likely be as well. Good news is there's a light shining at the end of the tunnel (hopefully it's not a fuse).
Not sure what I'll do this weekend. I'd like to hit the gym a few times if possible. Other than that, probably catch up on errands and maybe catch a movie in the theatre - haven't done that in a while.
That's me on the iPhone, signing out. ...

                    So last week I decided that I was going to try and break my whole staying up late, getting up late routine and actually make an effort to go to bed early and get up early. For the most part (except for getting in a bit later today, which is excusable but unfortunately not bloggable), I've been keeping to a routine of hitting the sack around 11, reading on my laptop until 11:30 or so, and getting up at 7am.
Now, I have a queen sized bed. I've had one for years now I guess, ever since university. But the funny thing is, I will never ever be able to sleep like I have a queen sized bed. For the most ...
