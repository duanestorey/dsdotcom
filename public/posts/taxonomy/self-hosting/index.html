                For those of you who actually come to my site from time to time, you'll have undoubtedly noticed my little counter in the right corner of the sidebar. What that tracks is how long my website has been active in the corner of my living room. If you're on a paid hosting account, fire me off an email whenever your server goes down so I can keep track against how mine's doing. So far I'm at 17 days straight without any downtime.

                Yes, sports fans, it's been twelve days since I decided to move my hosting back onto my living room floor. So far, it's been 12 days of pure bliss, of heavenly visions filled with bunny rabbits and endless fields of sunshine and happiness, where kids run forever.
But seriously, things have been going rather great. I haven't had a single hiccup, and get complete SQL backups emailed to me twice a day, just in case something were to ever go wrong. All my data is backed up with RAID 5 storage (and w...

                After setting up my RAID 5 array last night, I decided that maybe I would take a stab at self hosting my blog again. Up until two years ago, I had always run my blog from home. It's not really that hard to set up your own Apache server, and Linux can literally run for months or more without requiring a reboot. The downside of course is that home internet connections can be flaky, and most co-locations and hosting companies have UPS backup when things go wrong.
I recently upgraded my home fiber i...

                So if you hadn't noticed, my blog has been really flaky for the last week or so. For some reason, all the hard drive space on my machine keeps disappearing, and it's causing mysql and apache to occasionally crash. I spent a few hours this morning trying to figure it out, so hopefully it will be a bit more stable soon. As for today, I'll probably hang out by the water for an hour or so, and then maybe do some grocery shopping. I'm going to get a membership tomorrow at the Bentall Fitness Center I...
