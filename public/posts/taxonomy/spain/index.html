                    Hey everyone,
I've started a new website called TapasForever detailing my goal for living for a year in Spain. If you're interested in the journey, or perhaps want to move to Europe for a year or longer in the future, head on over and check it out.

I recommend visiting the Start Here page for information on the various resources that will be available. I'm looking forward to getting my visa and checking off a lot of boxes in terms of things I would to accomplish in life (Spanish language, I'm looking at you!).
Cheers, Duane ...

                    So if you're here, you're likely thinking about moving to Spain at some point. I know this, because that's my end goal as well. Maybe not forever, but likely for a year or more.

One of the first hurdles you may encounter is opening a bank account. Once you have a long-term stay visa or a temporary residence in Spain, you can open an account as a resident. But there are certain advantages to having one sooner. For example, I thought moving larger amounts of money from Canada to Spain would probably be much easier when I am actually physically present in Canada, so I thought opening a bank account ...

                    In less than two weeks from today, I'll be leaving St. Jean Pied de Port, France and starting my 800 kilometre journey to Santiago de Compostela. People keep asking me if I'm excited, and a small part of me at this point definitely is. But I typically don't start feeling real excitement or butterflies until I'm on the airplane heading to my destination.

                    While I still have roughly two months before I head to St. Jean Pied de Port, France to start the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage, I have been focusing a lot of time recently with packing. I'd like to start being able to do some practice walks with a full pack shortly, which means I need to get my pack to roughly the same weight as it will be when I arrive. Of course, I could just fill it with rocks for now, but since I already have many of the items with me at home, I thought I'd just finish buying what I need and have it done ahead of time.
As a rule of thumb, most people try to bring around 10% ...

                    In about 90 days, I'm heading to London, England, to spend my birthday. As you get older, birthdays become less and less important I find, certainly not enough to warrant a huge drunk at the bar. So I thought this year I would spend my birthday in another country, hopefully meeting a few new people and maybe exploring the countryside.
A few days after my birthday, I'm heading to Spain to start the Camino de Santiago, a famous Christian pilgrimage that ends in the city of Santiago, Spain. Historically many people attempted the long walk as penance for their sins, but nowadays people walk it for ...

                    Prior to visiting Barcelona for my first time this year, I had no idea who Antoni Gaudi was. But after spending a few days in Barcelona visiting architectural sites, it's pretty clear what a revolutionary architect he was.

Antonia Guadi was a Catalan architect whose various works in Spain have become extremely important, and draw huge crowds of tourists each day. While not entirely appreciated when he was alive, several of his works have now been classified as Unesco World Heritage Sites and he is one of Spain's most revered architects.

                    Last year while in Paris I decided to head down to the Louvre, one of the finest museums of art in the world. While there are several masterpieces there, one of the most valuable paintings in the world in also displayed inside the Louvre: The Mona Lisa.
The Mona Lisa, or La Gioconda, is a painting by Leonardo da Vinci, and is thought to be a painting of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo. Part of the painting's appeal is the beautiful Tuscan background and the enigmatic pose of Lisa in the painting.
