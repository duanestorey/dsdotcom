                I live a fortunate life. I have a profession that effectively lets me work from anywhere in the world, all while making an income generally in North American dollars. Popularized by such ‘visionaries’ as Tim Ferris, my lifestyle, and the lifestyle of potentially a billion people by the year 2035, is likely a new world norm. No longer are people like me stuck in offices - we can get on airplanes and work from anywhere in the world - from the remote jungles of Vietnam, to the beautiful mountai...

                I just saw a fairly recent (February 2008) film showing a slide-show that Al Gore recently gave on climate change. Here's a version of the video from Ted.com. It's inline with the material presented in his film, An Inconvenient Truth, but includes recent data and observations.
I watched that video once earlier today, and once again the moment this posting went live. To be honest, while I think he makes amazing points, I have a hard time watching it, mostly because the frustration is so evident i...

                For those of you who hadn't heard, today is the day of Earth Hour, a event set up by the WWF to show support against global warming and climate change. From their website:


On March 29, 2008 at 8 p.m., join millions of people around the world in making a statement about climate change by turning off your lights for Earth Hour, an event created by the World Wildlife Fund.
Earth Hour was created by WWF in Sydney, Australia in 2007, and in one year has grown from an event in one city to a global m...
