                It's a long weekend here in Canada, and I really had no plans. Originally, Rebecca, John and I were gonna go camping, but weather dictates that that's no longer an option. Rebecca and John decided to come hang out for the weekend, which is obviously awesome, since I don't get to hang out with them as much anymore.

I'm going to pass around a bit of link-juice this morning. First, we have Rebecca and Keira, who are packing up and heading to the island for some licking and snowboarding.

That means John is currently wifeless, so I thin...

Last night I hit Wings on Granville with Rebecca, Keira and John. For those of you who haven't been, it's a quaint little spot next to the Howard Johnson hotel on Granville Street that has cheap wings from 2-6pm daily.

I figured since I was getting up at 6:30am to drive Rebecca to the airport that four hours should be enough time. Unfortunately I think forgot to factor in the amount of caffeine I had had over the course of the evening. So when my alarm started beeping at 6:30am, I realized I hadn't really had any sleep yet.

I'm definitely going to hit Seymour with Rebecca and John soon, but was wondering if any other of my crazy readers were hitting the slopes this year. If so, where do you normally go? I need people who kind of suck to go with, since I'm pretty much guaranteed to roll down most of the hills.

This is obviously really exciting, and Rebecca will be part of a team of bloggers attempting to show off their combined knowledge on national TV.

Congrats Rebecca, and best of luck on the show. We'll do a group watching event here when the time comes. You can read more about it over on her site....

As I mentioned before, I'm flying the whole trip in business class (thanks for air miles), so I'm hoping it will be a pretty enjoyable flight.

The closest event to this that I've been a part of was the unconference at Northern Voice back in February, which had a really great turn out.
