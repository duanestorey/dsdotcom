                I watched Test The Nation tonight to see how the Bloggers and Rebecca faired on the show. The bloggers, in pure geeky awesomeness, managed the win!
Here's a shot of Rebecca holding the winning trophy!

Congrats guys! You did us all proud.
John Biehler posted some great clips of Rebecca rocking Test The Nation. Check it out (and listen to the idiots booing in the background -- I guess they thought they'd win?)
I'm bookmarking your blog too....

                I was up late playing around with some stuff on the computer, and didn't manage to actually lay down until around 2:30am. I figured since I was getting up at 6:30am to drive Rebecca to the airport that four hours should be enough time. Unfortunately I think forgot to factor in the amount of caffeine I had had over the course of the evening. So when my alarm started beeping at 6:30am, I realized I hadn't really had any sleep yet.

Congrats Rebecca, and best of luck on the show. We'll do a group watching event here when the time comes. You can read more about it over on her site....
