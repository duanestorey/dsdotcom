                    I was wondering today just how long my little garden has been growing for. Looking at my Flickr set, it looks like I had moved a few of the tomato seedlings outside on May 22nd. Here's a shot at the time:

I took a few photos today, and wanted to do a little comparison. It's been roughly five weeks since I started, and here's what things look like today:
