                    I had a call yesterday from a good friend of mine who lives overseas. We used to work together in Vancouver, so it was good to catch up. He actually lives in a little small town in the middle of Serbia, a place where glasses of wine go for about 50 cents, and people spend a lot more time hanging out and socializing than over here. Prior to moving to Serbia, my friend lived in both Kelowna and Vancouver.
I spent most of my 20s working 60 hour weeks, all for the promise of that golden carrot. Looking back, I'm thankful I had many of the experiences I ended up having, but regret the amount of time ...

                    I have, over the course of my career, given a pile of interviews. One of the trends I've seen a lot in recent years is people who feel the need to lie or exaggerate on their resumes.
There's nothing wrong with wording your experience in such a way to promote you a bit better, just so long as you don't lie or stretch the truth to the point where it's unbelievable. In fact, when I started in the realm of software development, I had basically zero real world experience in the area, and that was often looked as a complete detriment to me (even though I had been coding since I was about 15 years old). ...
