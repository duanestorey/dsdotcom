                    So today is January 13th, which means I've been both caffeine and pop (soda for you Americans) free since the start of the year. I've given up caffeine at various times in my life, so that's not amazingly impressive for me. But I can't say that I've ever given up pop for more than a few days at a time before.
I've had quite a few problems sleeping over the last few years, and I often have trouble both falling asleep and staying asleep. It seems even the smallest of noises will wake me up sometimes, or even something as small as a breeze blowing across some exposed skin. To be honest, it pretty ...

                    I had some of the weirdest dreams that I can remember in a long time last night. I went to bed at 10:30pm last night because I was so bagged, so maybe that has something to do with it.
I dreamt that I had to fly out to Timmins, Ontario this morning because I had to be in court. Some guy from high school was suing me for something and (despite both living here) the court date somehow ended up in Timmins. I bought a new suit for the event, but unfortunately I left it on the floor of the hotel room and showed up in court in my jeans. Some of my friends were flying out as character witnesses, but ...

                    Yes, today I briefly debated getting out of my bed at around nine, but decided sleeping in until noon was a better idea. I've had this recurring dream for the last few years that always feels so real. In it, someone (usually my friend Jeff) tells me about some university exam that I'm late for. Of course, everyone is completely prepared for the exam except for me. So I get to the exam and struggle for a good portion of my dream trying to come up with answers I don't have.
For whatever reason, that one always seems real to me. When I wake up, I sometimes almost want to make a call to the university ...

                    I rarely dream, or remember them at least. Last night however, I had one of the best nights of dreaming in a long time. Most of them were a bit messed up, and a few of them were of the past. I woke up at around 5am this morning actually feeling like it was about ten years ago based on some dreams I was having. That's a strange feeling.
Then, at 6am, the fire alarm went off, so I spent the first few minutes trying to find something to wear downstairs, and then evetually stumbled down 15 flights of stairs in some jeans, I think. Thankfully the cute girl from 14 was there too in her jammies, so I ...
