                    Just read that an Air Canada flight from Victoria to Toronto was forced to make an emergency landing in Calgary due to turbulence. Apparently the plane hit a patch of turbulence that sent a pile of people into the ceiling. I would have probably shit my pants had that happened on my flight. My last flight to Kelowna was pretty bad, and my glasses came off at one point, but thankfully my head didn't encountered the ceiling.

Half a dozen passengers were badly injured after an Air Canada plane bucked in midair on a flight across Canada, probably because of heavy turbulence.

                    So Leila just came up to me at work today and said congrats. I said "for what?" And she said she was recently on an Air Transat flight and came across a pile of photos in the middle of the in-flight magazine from my last trip to the Dominican Republic. She said they all said "photo by Duane Storey", and that she was sure they were mine.
Funny thing is I had no idea they had been published. I know Air Transat has a section where users can submit their photos for consideration, which I did after coming back from the Dominican Republic, but nobody ever contacted me and said they were going to use ...

                    I have to ask -- what is it with everyone's obsession to feed each other stuff that's really bad for you? Every day at work is a constant battle of having to tell people you don't want cookies, or chocolate, or donuts. It seems like everywhere I go someone is trying to ram a cookie down my throat.
I like sweets as much as the next guy, but I'm not sure where this fad came from. I really hate having to tell someone "no" ten times. It's fun for the first two, and then it's just super annoying. As someone who has basically had to watch my weight my entire life, I really get upset when people hammer ...

This weekend there are two birthdays going on, Kasia and Rebecca, which should be a lot of fun. Rebecca is just about to breach "cougar territory" and I'm glad I get to be around to see the start of the transition. ...

                    I have attended a few photowalks in the last year, most of which have been in or around the Gastown area. These events have typically brought together anywhere from 5 to 50 people, and have usually involved people walking around and snapping shots for an hour or two. They are a lot of fun, and always a great chance for people to improve their skills or just get out and stretch their wings a bit.
I'm organizing one down in my neck of the woods for this Sunday. It will be mostly along the beach, eventually ending up near English Bay and the famous Inukshuk. Hopefully we'll even manage to catch a ...

                    In 1997, I decided to mix things up a bit and took a summer job up in Whitehorse, YT, working at the weather station up there for Environment Canada. It was really my first time away from home in any capacity, and also marked the first time I was in a long distance relationship. Needless to say, when I walked off the plane way up north, I was a bit bummed, and a bit out of sorts.
I spent the first three days living in a hotel room, desperately trying to find a place to live, since Environment Canada only offered to pay for three days of hotel. I finally found a small room in a trailer living with ...

The Matrix in HD
Dark City
Gladiator
Desperado
Heat
Ocean's Thirteen in HD

So we'll see how it goes. Jeff will probably show up in a bit, and I'm not sure who else. I'm guessing The Matrix will be first just to kick everything off with a bag of kick-ass. My copy of Dark City has seen better days, so I'm trying to rip it to my laptop and ...

                    Surprisingly, I have never seen this before.. It's an old opening scene from Star Wars: A New Hope. I thought it was a complete fake at first, but it looks like it was real footage that was intended to be included at one point.
What's weird is that it's sort of processed and seems to have been scored, which is unusual for anything that hits the cutting room floor. Possibly some fan added some Star Wars music to those scenes, but the music fits rather nicely which sort of makes me think it was in the movie up until the last minute.

                    Lately I've been noticing a ton of problems over in Facebook land. First of all, alot of the searches seem to return inconsistent results. Sometimes certain friends will appear, and another times they don't. It seems to be entirely random, but it's kind of a pain in the ass once you cross over a 100 friends or more. Local gastown-walking-guru Rod Bruno has also had his account randomly deleted several times now, with no apparent explanation.

Also, from time to time when I try to login I get the "your user account is down for maintenance" message, and then told to try again later. Maybe this is ...

                    2007 is officially in the past now, and today was basically the start of a whole new year, at least in terms of my routine again. I spent the day at work today getting back into the groove again. Tomorrow I will most likely dive head-first into a fairly large new project, which should be pretty exciting.
I still have some unpacking to do from my trip, and will most likely take the tree and decorations down this coming weekend. At that point, the holidays will be completely behind me. I think tomorrow Dustin and I are going to get together and hang out for a bit, and this weekend there will probably ...

                    I rarely dream, or remember them at least. Last night however, I had one of the best nights of dreaming in a long time. Most of them were a bit messed up, and a few of them were of the past. I woke up at around 5am this morning actually feeling like it was about ten years ago based on some dreams I was having. That's a strange feeling.
Then, at 6am, the fire alarm went off, so I spent the first few minutes trying to find something to wear downstairs, and then evetually stumbled down 15 flights of stairs in some jeans, I think. Thankfully the cute girl from 14 was there too in her jammies, so I ...

                    Well, I made it. I had originally been scheduled to fly out on the 2nd of January, but since I figured everyone would be tired and hungover on the 1st that I'd just head back then and get rested up for the grind again. After everyone left the hotel, I called West Jet to see if there were any openings on any flights. Pretty much the only one that worked was the 7am flight out of Toronto. Since it was already 4am, I figured I might as well just head to the airport and sleep on the plane.
Of course, once I got to the airport nothing was really open and the line ups were already pretty big. I did ...
