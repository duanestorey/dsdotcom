                    One of the reasons I ultimately moved back to Chilliwack is because I wanted to sort of take a well deserved rest from the last ten years of my life. Basically since leaving high school, my life has been one non-stop rollercoaster ride. My time in Ottawa was spent doing 60 hour weeks mostly at work, and I don't even really remember that period of my life. During my master's degree I was doing lots of research at school, and I also did a part time job on the side to help pay some bills. My first few years at CounterPath were crazy hectic as well, and most of us spent the first few years of our ...

                    At the current population growth rates, by the year 2500 people will be standing shoulder to shoulder on every piece of habitable land on this planet. So while our immediate problems have to do with global warming and obvious aggressions in various parts of the world, at some point population is going to become a focus as well.

It seems somewhat obvious to me that at some point there needs to be a type of population control on this planet. I've been racking my brain trying to figure out how to implement something like that that doesn't have any massive moral implications, and truthfully, I haven't ...

                    One of the major initiatives I've taken upon myself since moving back home is to actually eat at home for all of my meals. The last time I think I consistently ate three meals a day that I actually made for myself was probably back in high school.
Since moving out here, I'm happy to say that I've been fairly successful eating at home. It does take a lot of effort though, and I find I have to hit a grocery store every second day or so just to top up produce and what-not. The nice thing about being out here though is that it's easy to bounce between various specialty stores in the same trip.

Given that the BC Liberal Party was also a sponsor of WordCamp Whistler, and that I was one of the organizers, I thought I should share my thoughts on this.
First, I want to point out the logistics of an event like this. Organizing WordCamp Whistler was literally two months of solid work. A few days prior to the event I was fielding well over 100 emails a day trying to keep the boat afloat, and pull everything together so that the conference would be successful. ...

I left Chilliwack back when I was 18 years old to attend university. When I graduated, I moved myself across the country and spent a few years in Ottawa working in the high-tech sector out there. Then I moved back home and did a bit more school, and finally ended up at CounterPath, where I have spent the last five years working away.
The move was pretty uneventful thankfully. My dad came out in the morning to help, which was totally appreciated as it turns out ...

                    CNN posted some videos from the Airbus plane that ditched into the Hudson the other day. Ditching is actually a fairly common practice for military aircraft, obviously less common for passenger aircraft. To pull of a successful ditch, you basically have to have a perfect landing such that the wings don't dip and hit the water. Thankfully the pilot pulled it off, and every single person survived this incident (which is rare for a commercial passenger jet).

Kind of strange though that this current incident was caught by so many independent cameras, and yet the airplane ...

                    I left Vancouver yesterday afternoon to head into Chilliwack and pick up the keys to my new apartment. On the way, I stopped and met a really old friend of mine from high-school, and we had a few beers and a plate of nachos. I have to say, it was a rather strange feeling being in my apartment all alone after the landlord left. I sort of just stared around at the empty apartment, trying to digest just how I felt. Without a doubt, I am excited. I am definitely looking forward to what the next year or two will bring, and to enjoying life at a slower pace for a while.

Tickets are still available, so if you'd like to come, make sure you sign up now. Included in the price of a ticket is a full day of WordPress and social media related talks, lunch, a few drinks at the social event, and a piece of one-of-a-kind WordPress schwag.
The participants of WordCamp Whistler have also been extended an invite to a Beer For Bloggers event up in Whistler on Friday, the 23rd. So if you're up in Whistler by then, there are ...

                    Well, last night was interesting, to say the least. For those of you who follow around here, about a year ago I decided to host my blog from home instead of on some shared hosting account. My main reason for doing that was that I had been through around 3 shared hosting providers that year, and all of them had let me down on more than one occasion. So I figured I could do it better myself.
Which was true to an extent. However last night, while I was packing boxes near the server, I guess I accidentally bumped the power cable, causing my server to reboot. Normally, that's not a terrible thing, ...

                    Never leave a few episodes of heroes on your web server, thinking that some day you'll want to access them remotely. Somehow someone found where they were on my server, and sure enough, I've been providing the bandwidth for a lot of happy viewers somewhere over the last few days. Novus emailed me last night and told me I was up to 100GB worth of traffic already this month, which is obviously fairly steep. Looking at my logs I found the reason in short order, and stopped all those pesky leeches. ...

                    I went out with a few friends last night, which was fun. I ran into my good friend Kasia at the bar, which was pretty cool.

It also reminded me how much I'm going to miss all the people I've gotten to know in Vancouver. But hopefully I'll be out here from time to time, or people will come visit me once and a while.
Only a few more days. Still looking forward to it. Gotta start packing soon though. ...

                    In just four days, I get to swing out to Chilliwack and grab the keys for my new place. First thing I'm looking forward to is turning the heat on in the new apartment, as it was pretty cold there when I swung by for a visit in December. My furniture is supposed to be delivered on January 20th, but I think I'm going to put the call in to deliver it on the morning on the 15th or something. I have to leave work a bit early on the 14th to make it to Chilliwack in time to do the walk-through on my place, but I'd like to do that part myself and meet my landlord as well.
I'm planning on leaving my car ...

                    Tomorrow (depending on when you read this), is Rebecca Bollwitt's birthday (or Friday, if you're looking for an absolute time). I first met Rebecca at Northern Voice 2007 I believe, and had just come out of my first round of surgery (thanks to those four idiots who put me in the hospital). It was a time when I desperately needed the support of others the most, and a role her and John took up instantly in my life. Since that time, Rebecca and John have become really close friends of mine here in Vancouver, and I can't imagine my life at this point without them in it. In fact, of all the reservations ...

                    Don't have much time this morning, but I wanted to give a quick update. First off, I had a shower before I went to bed last night. Unfortunately, I left the floor a little bit wet, something I realized at around 4am when I went to the bathroom and complete wiped out. Somehow I busted my hand open trying to stop myself from falling, and I bruised my shoulder pretty bad. I woke up with dried blood on my hand this morning, so I must have whacked it pretty good.
This is my sixth last day of work, and then I'm done. I haven't even begun to think about packing yet, and probably won't get a chance to ...
