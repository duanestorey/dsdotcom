                    I woke up late today, not that I'm really keeping track of the time or anything. I was originally gonna stroll down to the gym when I woke up, but slept a bit later than I normally do so I skipped the gym and the morning buffet. I met Dale and Sara by the pool for a few hours of reading, a bit of snack bar love, and then ultimately made it down to the gym for a bit of a mini workout.

The days here seem to go fairly quick, even though we don't really do all that much. Most of the time we all just sort of relax by the pool or the ocean, and the days are split up with a meal here and there or a ...

                    What else can you say, really? It's quite gorgeous here. Strangely enough, I'm sort of adverse to massive amounts of heat, but for some reason the temperature here seems about perfect. Sure, it gets a bit hot during the day, but nothing a few beers and a dip in the pool can't fix. And in the evenings the temperature drops enough to toss on a pair of jeans and chill in the lobby bar for a few hours.

I've been going easy on the alcohol since I arrived, partially because I haven't been feeling 100%, and partially because I'm not 22 any more. But today was a fairly fun, alcohol involved day, mostly ...

                    About half-way through my flight the other day I went to the bathroom and really wasn't feeling good. I really have no idea what it was, but my stomach was pretty upset and I was feeling a bit achy. Shortly after writing my blog posting yesterday, I ended up feeling pretty worse, and went to my room to curl up in bed. I passed out around 8pm or so, and slept until almost noon this morning (unfortunately, a rather unrestful sleep since my stomach was keeping me up).
So I'm not sure if I caught something on the plane, or possibly ate something that didn't agree with me (which I kind of doubt, since ...

                    Wow, I gotta say, flying at 1am is a massive downer. Not only is the airport totally depressing at that time, but it's near impossible falling asleep on a big plane like that full of crying babies and what not. The stop in Calgary ended up being over two hours, which kind of sucked. I tried sleeping off and on, but I wasn't very successful.
But anyways, I'm here, and it's hot! I haven't found any wireless yet, so I actually paid for internet service in their little internet cafe here. So I don't have access to my mail right now (if you've mailed me something, I probably won't get it until I figure ...

While the last few weeks have been a bit light in terms of work, Dale and I have been going pretty much non-stop all of this last year, even working part of Christmas at the start of the year.

                    I actually woke up last night and thought things were shaking a bit, but thought it was due to the wind. Turns out several earthquakes struck off the coast of British Columbia last night, the largest one being a 6.6 on the Richter scale. I've actually experienced a few earthquakes now, one in the lower mainland when I was about 17 years old, and another one when I was visiting Tokyo (which was a bit scary, given that I was on the 37th floor or something and my cell phone was bouncing around on the table due to the quake).
Anyways, you can read more about it here. ...

                    I'm a big fan of naps. In the summer, I love nothing more than passing out on the couch with a book, and sleeping passively with the sound of a lawnmower churning off somewhere in the distance. In the winter, I sometimes turn the fireplace on in the early evening and close my eyes on the couch. I don't sleep long usually. 30 minutes sometimes, maybe an hour. Usually just long enough for the world to slowly dissolve into a dream. And in that brief moment when I wake up, sometimes it briefly feels like I'm in another place, or another time in my life. I'm often reminded how the smell of fresh grass ...

                    First off, Seattle was a lot of fun, and it was great seeing Dave and Lauren tie the knot. The ceremony was really well done, and the venue was spectacular. I had a really great time there with my friend Lynn and everyone else we met on the dance floor. I haven't been all suited up in a while, so it was nice to dress up for a change. The Alexis Hotel fireplace suite was really posh as well, and it was super nice of them to put me up in it for the weekend.

Today I was driving along, having a pretty good time listening to music, when I looked up in my rear view mirror and saw the cherries flashing.

That said, I'm hoping to meet up with a friend tomorrow night and maybe go catch a movie or go bowling or something. My friend Lynn is also coming along to the wedding on Saturday, which should be a lot of fun.

Regardless, it's making me more and more excited to be on the beach in about seven days now.
Tomorrow I'm taking it pretty easy since it's a stat holiday. That said, we're going to push out some quick updates for WordTwit and WPtouch which should hopefully allow the two to start working together.

Around 20:00 the guy actually sort of destroys his own thesis statement by saying how much they should have lost based on the calories consumed. If that were certain, there would really be no point in doing a study on macronutrient composition
Around 39:00 he mentions insulin resistance, which is what I talk about on here all the time (hyperinsulinema)
Around 41:00 he has another important thesis statement, "reducing the glycemic load may be especially important to achieve weight ...

                    It's true, I hate going to the gym. Lots of people say they go and get this massive rush of endorphins and it makes them feel like they are on a high all day. I generally feel a bit more energetic when I leave the gym, but not to the point where I feel super amazing. I see some of the people who do hours at a time of cardio, and I just can't imagine how they do it.
The thing is, it's not that I'm lazy. I love sports, and I'd like nothing more than to whack a tennis ball around now or play a game of badminton. For the most part though, I just find the gym super boring. Maybe I need some new music ...

                    I rented a pile of movies on the weekend, mostly older flicks I had already seen before. That being said, I went over to my brother-in-law's house on Friday and watched District 9 and Bruno.
District 9 was completely unexpected, and I'm not even sure what I thought of it to be honest. Overall I enjoyed it, and it was the first movie to surprise me in a long time, probably since From Dusk til Dawn. Without a doubt, you can see Peter Jackson's hand in the movie, especially with the parallels to his own mockumentary, Forgotten Silver (that caused a lot of controversy when it came out), and some of ...

                    Hard to believe I'll be getting on a plane in 10 days and heading on vacation for two weeks. Truthfully, I'm really looking forward to relaxing by the pool with a few books. Reading is something I get a lot of enjoyment out of, but for whatever reason I go through big periods where I don't really read all that much. So I'm hoping to hit a Chapters store before I leave and grab a pile of books.
Like most vacations, I'm debating whether or not to bring my digital SLR. Truthfully, I think I'm going to leave it at home this time. I love having it around, but it's just a pain lugging it around and ...

                    I spent some time at lunch today giving my car a bunch of TLC. I've noticed this last little while that the tires are slipping a lot, so I suspected that they were pretty much toast. I had a tread test done on them yesterday, and they came back at 4/32s, 5/32s, 5/32s, and 10/32s, the last one being the tire I replaced that blew up on the way to Seattle last year. 2/32s is the legal limit, and 4/32s is where you basically stop having traction in the rain and snow. I might have been able to squeeze another 4 months or so out of these in the summer, but I just decided to bite the bullet and put something ...

                    It's no secret that I'm not really big into winter sports. I've always liked them, I've just never been an active participant. As a kid, I went a few times with my parents back when they were still together I believe, but I didn't really go all that much in high school or university. In fact, I've only really been snowboarding once, and that was Dec 31st, 1995 I believe (I remember because I was so insanely sore for the following New Year's Day).
In university my friend Dustin used to go night skiing all the time. I always though it was pretty cool that he would just load his car up in the evening, ...
