                    I got a call from the accountant this morning, and she said my taxes were all done. I just had to swing by and sign some forms and they would be e-filed.
Before I gave her my taxes, I did a quick trial run myself, just to see what the difference would be. If I were to have filed them, I would have gotten back around $600. Having her do it (and properly take into account all my camera gear), I get about $1800 back. Her fee for doing my taxes was about $160, so that means my net return is $1640, or about $1000 more than I would have gotten had I done them myself.
Not bad. ...

                    I was out at Waves Coffee until around 2:10am last night, which was an interesting experience unto itself. The first question I have is for all you ladies -- how come the majority of you are dating dipshits? Pretty much every girl that walked in last night had some idiot guy attached to her. This one in particular reminded me of the typical drug dealer back home -- you know, with the fancy phone, crooked hat, tons of jewelry, and an attitude that just wouldn't quit. The guy had his girlfriend running errands in the coffeeshop for him while he sat and tried to degrade her verbally. Even after she ...

                    I set up a Linux box at home a while ago, mainly so that I'd have a stable place to run my blog. To that end, I installed Centos on it, which is an enterprise grade version of Linux (many hosting companies use it).
The one downside to using Centos is that most of the packages in the repositories are rather old (although they are usually stable). So if you want to stay on the cutting edge, it's fairly hard using this distribution.
While trying to install PHP 5.2 tonight, I stumbled upon a a really great up-to-date Centos repository. Thankfully it has prebuilt PHP and MYSQL versions. ...

I checked my settings, and it's definitely setup to only include photos from my stream, so the problem seems to be on their end. I tried finding a contact email on their site, but all they do is push you to the support forums (I hate this practice by companies nowadays -- support your ...

The good news is that my test came back c. diff negative, and although that's not a fail safe test, it's at least partially good news. Based on my symptoms and my tests, the specialist is fairly certain that I've developed either irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or lactose intolerance, both of which can temporarily arise after fighting a gastro-intestinal ...

                    Here comes another rant:
As most of you know, back in November I was in the hospital with pneumonia. While there, I picked up a hospital acquired infection known as c. diff. It's unfortunately rather common these days mainly due to the lack of cleanliness in hospitals (and also due to the abuse of broad-spectrum anti-biotics in hospitals). But without a doubt, it's a serious infection, and is responsible for many deaths. The superbug the media focuses on is MRSA, but in terms of fatalities, c. diff kills about twice as many people. Just last month it claimed the life of a mother who went to the ...

Normally, when shooting photographs, you use your hard drive as permanent storage and your compact flash cards as temporary storage. I had so little space on my hard drive during the Junos though that I was forced to reverse the two, and was literally using extra CF cards to make up the hard drive difference.
Today I sat down to see if I could figure out where it all went. The key application I used was Disk Inventory X, a great little tool that graphically displays where all your space ...

Of course, everyone is completely prepared for the exam except for me. So I get to the exam and struggle for a good portion of my dream trying to come up with answers I don't have.
For whatever reason, that one always seems real to me. When I wake up, I sometimes almost want to make a call to the university ...

I've been on anti-biotics for a few days now, and while my bronchitis is subsiding, my stomach has been bothering me. Not sure if that's related to the infection I acquired last fall, or if it's just the anti-biotics upsetting my stomach -- I guess I'll know for sure when I stop taking them.
There are a few things going on this weekend, but to be honest, I think I'm going to bail on everything and just rest. I think I might go get groceries tomorrow morning and then spend the rest of the weekend ...

                    For those of you who actually come to my site from time to time, you'll have undoubtedly noticed my little counter in the right corner of the sidebar. What that tracks is how long my website has been active in the corner of my living room. If you're on a paid hosting account, fire me off an email whenever your server goes down so I can keep track against how mine's doing. So far I'm at 17 days straight without any downtime.
If you check out Media Temple's status blog, you can see that they've had 50 minutes of outage during the last three days. Based on their own blog entries, they are running ...

                    Today marked the launch of Strutta, a local company that has been working hard to create a unique gaming experience. I had the opportunity to check out their product about six weeks ago and play with an early alpha. I think these guys have some great things in store for them, so make sure you head on over and check them out.
So on behalf of everyone here at duanestorey.com (yah I know, it's only me), I want to congratulate Maura, Danny, Alexa, Jordan, Lyal, and the rest of the Strutta team, on their accomplishments. Best of luck guys. ...

                    A few days ago I started getting a soreness in my throat and lungs that has since progressed into what I figured was bronchitis. I hit the medical clinic in Yaletown tonight and got a full check-up, and sure enough, it's what I thought it was. They've prescribed Zithromax, which should hopefully have me feeling a lot better in a day or two.
After filling my prescription on Pacific, I decided to check out a new coffee shop that opened up there. The coffee shop is Waves Coffee, and it's a quaint little spot right on the West Side of Yaletown. It reminded me a lot of the coffee shops I used to spend ...

                    I was just lying on my bed, opening some mail from the last few months that I haven't gotten around to opening. I thought since I have an appointment for taxes coming up that I should get all my receipts and everything in order.
In one envelope, I find this letter, apparently involving some parking violation I had around Christmas:

THIS IS TO COMMAND YOU IN HER MAJESTY'S NAME TO APPEAR BEFORE A JUSTICE ON APRIL 14, 2008
In case you're not following the date, that was yesterday, and I obviously didn't show. The next part is the worrisome piece of information:

                    For those that are interested, I finally found an account downtown that I think is willing to do my taxes. I've typically always done them myself, except for one year when I had a bunch of stock and moving expenses I wasn't sure how to deal with. I have income from multiple sources this year (thanks to photography and the odd web job), which should mean (in theory) that I'm eligible to write off some of my photography and computer expenses.
Unfortunately, I'm not the most organized person in the world, and I somehow have to track down all my tax stuff from last year, along with everything from ...
