                    I hate Air Canada, really I do. They have screwed me over so many times and are at least partially responsible for how much I hate flying these days. The last time they gave it to me was last year coming back from Boston. I arrived 90 minutes before my flight and was told that due to weather they were going to delay us a while in the airport. Since I was hungry and needed a beer, I said no problem. So, they booked me on a flight two hours later and said it would be fine.

The funny thing is even though it was raining outside, every other airline appeared to be operating normally. After dinner ...

                    I woke up this morning and briefly turned my laptop on to check my email. After about ten minutes of cursing Leopard for not being able to connect to my wireless network I realized that the power was out in my building, which would explain why my wireless router was down (along with everyone else's). Apparently there was a memo about it, but I'm not so good with memos.
So, power is still down after four hours. I'm at an internet cafe on Davie grabbing a quick jolt of caffeine, and then am going to cruise around and buy a few small things I've been meaning to pick up (like some more glasses). Remeber ...

                    I was up late playing around with some stuff on the computer, and didn't manage to actually lay down until around 2:30am. I figured since I was getting up at 6:30am to drive Rebecca to the airport that four hours should be enough time. Unfortunately I think forgot to factor in the amount of caffeine I had had over the course of the evening. So when my alarm started beeping at 6:30am, I realized I hadn't really had any sleep yet.

Upon arriving at the airport, Rebecca had a call from her people out in Toronto letting her know that her flight had been cancelled. So we went to Milestone's restaurant ...

                    Yes, it's that time of month again, maid day. When I got sick with pneumonia in the fall my mom came and spent a few days with me and ended up cleaning my entire apartment. Being a busy, single guy, it was in a pretty sad state. My mom, being a constant worrier, implored me, for her sake, to get someone to help clean my apartment so it would be clean and I wouldn't have to worry about getting sick at home.
Since I'm sort of cheap (at least for things that don't involve technology), but wanted to put my mom's mind at ease, I made myself a compromise -- I'd get a maid but cancel my cable TV to pay ...

So when I heard that Jennifer Aniston was filming a block from where I work, I didn't really think anything of it. On my way home tonight as I was passing the Hyatt on Burrard Street I decided to stop for a sec and see if I could watch anything being filmed or check out the lighting and stuff. Right when I was about to keep moving I heard a voice nearby which ...

Eventually Clay got referred to a specialist since things just kept getting worse for him. Turns out he has a blockage in his heart which is why he's having problems.

For those of you who keep up with such things, Cloverfield has been somewhat of a mystery, relying mainly on word of mouth and a few minutes of raw footage released as a trailer for promotional means.
MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD
Going into the movie, I basically expected something similar to the Blair Witch Project, and for the most part, that's exactly what I got. Granted there are a few more effects in this movie, and it is set in the heart of Manhattan, but for the most part it's just the regurgitation of ...

Be afraid. Be very afraid.
I'm heading out to watch this tonight with Rebecca, John and John. Rebecca had tickets to the Vancouver premiere and invited me along, which is totally exciting. I'm going on the record as saying I'm pretty sure this is going to suck (the trailer reminds me of a techy Blair Witch Project), but it'll be a fun suck with a bunch of friends. That sounds dirty, I know.
Check out the trailer below:
I'm pretty sure the entire budget for the film went into the funky Independence-Day-looking poster, just to attract more people. ...

Spaces? I actually thought these would be cool, but I just haven't been able to find a good use for them. In fact, I find myself accidentally switching between spaces from time to time thanks to how heavily I rely on the control and option keys for other things.
Stacks is another completely useless feature, mainly because you can't really see enough icons. Plus, it's generally a stupid ...

                    Apple just announced an ultra-think notebook computer called the Air.

Looks pretty cool, but it doesn't have a DVD drive, and is sealed shut like a big iPod. Based on my experiences with my Macbook Pro and Leopard, I think I'm definitely pulling myself out of the "early-adopter" crowd with Apple and waiting a while this round to see what happens. ...

                    In about 30 minutes, the beach photowalk near my place is going to begin. It turned out to be a rather nice day with some ideal light, so hopefully there will be a pile of great shots taken. The challenge always for me is figuring out what lens to bring and what exactly I want to shoot. I haven't shot film in quite a while, so I loaded some 160VC portrait film in my one camera and put my wide angle on it, and will bring my 70-200mm f/2.8L for doing some portraits near the water. I'm just making some coffee and making sure my cameras are good to go, then heading downstairs to meet people.
I'll ...

                    Last night, Rebecca and Trevor told me about the sex show this weekend taking place at the Vancouver Convention Center. Since I've never been to one, and haven't had an opportunity to take my camera out in a few weeks, I decided to head down and check it out.
 Live Entertainment
In terms of layout and logistics, it was like any other tech conference I had ever been at. There were tons of booths, some of which made sense given the aim of the sex show, and some which obviously shouldn't have been there. One that comes to mind is Sun Life Financial in the back corner. Seriously, do you really expect ...

                    Ahh yes.. Friday.. So exciting.. This was a really good week. I hung out with friends, got some stuff done in the office, and have a pile of fun things to do this weekend. After work I'm meeting up with Rebecca, Kasia and maybe Keira for some wings and beer. Life's rough I know. Plus on the way over I want to buy a flash diffuser over at Leo's Camera on Granville, something that I used at the last wedding I shot and wished I actually owned.
Tomorrow there are two parties, one for Rebecca's birthday and one for Kasia's. I have to make appearances at both, but I think I can pull it off. And on Sunday ...

                    I get a lot of notifications in my inbox daily about scientific rumblings going on in the world, but this one caught my eye this evening. Some recent NASA data in the arctic region seems to point to a huge acceleration in the melting rate of the ice -- should the melting continue at its current rate, NASA scientists project that it's only a matter of years before the arctic might be completely ice free in the summers.

An already relentless melting of the Arctic greatly accelerated this summer, a warning sign that some scientists worry could mean global warming has passed an ominous tipping point. ...
