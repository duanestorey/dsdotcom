                    Welcome everyone the Blogathon 2009! Over the next 24 hours, I will be consuming insane amounts of caffeine while writing blog entries in an effort to generate some exposure and hopefully a bit of financial support for the charity of my choosing, the BC Children's Hospital Foundation.
I can't imagine many things worse in this world then being a parent and watching your child get sick. The BC Children's Hospital is known Canada wide for the work they do with children, which is why I've chosen it this year as my charity of choice.
I decided on the way to Workspace this morning that I was going to ...

I started working on a little spreadsheet of blog entries for tomorrow, but only filled in about 15 spots or so, which means the other 34 will have to be decided sometime tomorrow.
To be honest, I'm fairly beat. I don't even recall last year's Blogathon at this point, although I do remember hanging out at my place with Rebecca, John and Raul, sometime around midnight. I imagine somehow I'll make it to the end tomorrow, but at this point I think it's going to be ...

                    In less than 24 hours, Blogathon kicks off in Vancouver. I forced myself to go to bed around 11pm last night such that I would have a pretty decent sleep. I tried to get up at around 7am, but my body wasn't too happy about it, so instead I slept in until around 8:30am, and now I feel pretty decent.
In theory I should go easy on coffee today such that tonight I can have yet another decent sleep, so that's probably what I'll do. Tomorrow however I'll be pushing my little donkey cart down caffeine mountain there and riding it all the way to the bottom. I'm hoping there's some easy to access coffee ...

                    British Columbia just announced that they are going to be switching to a harmonized sales tax model in July of next year. Basically, instead of having a provincial sales tax (PST) of 7%, and a goods and services tax (GST) of 5%, they are going to have one combined tax, a harmonized sales tax (HST) of 12%.
I'm no economist, but that seems like a pretty bad idea. Here's a quote from the official release:

In less than 48 hours Blogathon 2009 will officially kick off. Some people will be down at WorkSpace in Vancouver hanging out, and others will be congregating in the Valley somewhere. I still haven't decided where I'll end up, although I'm leaning towards the WorkSpace route, as it would be nice to hang out with some friends for the day, and cross the finish line as a group. Free Ice Cream is pretty rad too, so.

                    I spent the last five years pretty much exclusively coding in C++. Strangely enough, I haven't really touched a C++ compiler since leaving Vancouver, and instead have been pretty much coding non-stop in PHP.
Obviously C++ is a compiled language, and PHP is an interpreted one. In terms of enjoyment, I think I like the challenge of coming up with cool C++ code, but without a doubt, PHP is far more enjoyable overall. The main reason, at least for me, is because I can write some code and instantly see the results of that code in PHP. With C++, you have to compile your code, and even with incremental ...

                    One of the things I've noticed lately is that I'm spending way more time on Twitter than I'd like. Truthfully, it's fairly addictive, and I really don't know why. This afternoon I noticed I noticed myself sitting on the updates page, refreshing occasionally, waiting for a few replies to some messages I had sent out. While doing that, I had the sudden idea that Twitter (at least for me) would be a bit more useful if it were a push system instead of a polling system. That way at least, I wouldn't have to sit at the site and continue to poll it -- I could simply be notified when a new @ message was ...

Most summers I'm not entirely successful, but last year I actually managed to go camping three or four times, which was enough to satisfy my cravings for the season.
Camping is actually one of the few things I really enjoy in life: just tossing my tent into the back of my car and driving off into the distance. Maybe it's that feeling I get when I'm half-cut and I stare up at the stars for a while, or the enjoyment I get watching the lights from the campfire dance around the ...

Strangely enough, you'd think I would have seen them all, given how I lived right on the corner of Beach and Howe in Vancouver for three years.

I have lots of memories of the fireworks, but my favourite memory, and a story I tell often, involves some heartache and a beer. I had just broken up with my ex-girlfriend, and was feeling a bit blue. So my friend Dustin came to hang out, and we decided to see the fireworks. Since we had a few hours to kill, we grabbed ...

                    I woke up yesterday in Cascade Locks, Oregon and decided to hit the coast for a few hours. I bounced through Portland, grabbed a coffee and some breakfast, and had a really great, leisurely drive along a forested road towards Cannon Beach. I pulled in right around lunch time, and hunted around for a good place to grab some food. Thankfully I found a neat little brew pub, just a block from the water.

I tasted a few of their beers, and also a nice plate of Halibut and Chips. Afterwards, I grabbed my camera and spent about an hour down on the beach.

Cannon Beach is of course super beautiful. The ...

                    Last week I had the chance to talk to Paul Henderson of the Chilliwack Times regarding Blogathon. We ended up talking about various other items, including Facebook and Twitter, and some of my thoughts about the stuff I was doing over at InTheWack.com (which I need to update a bit more frequently).
Today the Chilliwack Times ran a story in the local paper, and it appears the online version is available here.
Just a couple of clarification points:

Last year Rebecca and I supported the Union Gospel Mission. This year she is supporting it (as well as others I'm sure). The caption in the photo seems ...

                    I'm current hanging out at the KOA in Cascade Locks, Oregon. It's fairly dead here tonight, mainly because most people left today to go back to their 9-5 routines. Thankfully the wireless works a lot better now that not everyone is using it.
My friend Sean swung by tonight, so we had a few beers around the picnic table. It was good to catch up. Last time I saw him was probably about six or seven months ago down in Portland when I had a job interview.
I briefly went into Portland this afternoon to do a bit of work and to unlock my iPhone 3GS. Once I had my phone unlocked, I went down to Best Buy ...

                    This morning I woke up and decided to make some plans. Strangely enough, that line from Shawshank Redemption kept going through my head -- "get busy living, or get busy dying. You god damn right."
Anyways, it also didn't help matters that Dave and Lauren took off the other day, as well as Tanya and Gus. Even Dale left yesterday to go do some relaxing at a cottage. So Instead of just heading south without a plan (something I've done many times before and been burned for), I decided to call a few campgrounds first.
Thankfully the little KOA right outside of Portland had one tenting spot available, ...

                    Well, today was a bit of a disappointment. I was hoping to be camping right about now, but apparently it's next to impossible to get a campsite nowadays. Strangely enough, getting a campsite when I was in high school was trivial -- you'd simply go up to the lake whenever you wanted a spot, and you'd probably get one. Worse case you'd head down to Chilliwack Lake (40kms), and find a nice spot there for even less money.
Things started to change years ago when Discover Camping (the web service behind BC campgrounds) started allowing reservations. That means about half of the sites now typically go ...

                    I'm pretty close to wrapping up a few projects here, so much so that I'm half packed already for my upcoming road trip. Until this afternoon, I hadn't really decided what I was going to do for a little break, but after talking to a few people, decided to hit the open road and see where it takes me. It's more of a working vacation to be honest, as I still have a few client projects to do, but I plan to do them from beside the pool at a KOA, or little coffee shops near the ocean somewhere. I've been up and down the West Coast quite a few times now, so it's a drive I'm familiar with. But every trip ...

                    I've been playing guitar since I was about 18 years old. My first guitar was actually (believe it or not) a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. It was basically my high school present from my mom in exchange for graduating and getting myself to UBC. Unfortunately, I really couldn't afford an amplifier at the time, so I basically just practiced on it ampless for the first few years. Eventually I managed to save some cash and bought a Fender Princeton 112 amplifier, which I still have (although it's been at my friend's house for a few years now -- something I've been trying hard to remedy for about ...
