                    Having driven over the Port Mann bridge probably close to a thousand times in my life, I'm pretty much an expert on how traffic works in that area. Years ago, in an effort to relieve some congestion for westbound traffic heading into Vancouver, the city created a dedicate HOV (high occupancy vehicle) lane that goes pretty much from the Port Mann bridge all the way to the Hastings exit downtown.

Unfortunately though, one of the characteristics of that lane is that it's rarely used to capacity. There's nothing more frustrating than sitting in grid-locked traffic and seeing a completely empty lane ...

                    I just heard this on the news, and it's the kind of thing that makes my blood boil. The Hastings Racetrack is being forced to close for a month during the Olympics due to security concerns by VANOC. Lots of employees will be out of work, and some may even lose their jobs.
Given the Olympics are supposed to help the economy, it's rather ironic that VANOC is forcing some people out of work. Shouldn't the rights of the individual business owners be respected, regardless of what VANOC wants? ...

                    Now that I have cable again, I've been watching a bit more TV. Except for last night's Heroes and 24, I've been keeping up with all three shows.

Of them all, Lost is the only one that's really keeping me interested. I think the whole concept of 24 has just gone on too long now. I thought season two was pretty awesome, mainly because it focused on character development. Now it's more of an action flick. They had a good opportunity with that cute FBI agent, but they really haven't used her to her full potential yet.
I'm not sure why, but I find Heroes pretty boring these days. I guess because everyone ...

                    Obviously I've been spending a bit of time tweaking Apache such that it is well optimized for working in a VPS environment. Truthfully though, Apache is a major resource hog. To be honest, I really can't comprehend what it's doing with all that memory it seems to hoard. One of the other major downsides to Apache is that it forks additional processes to handle server load, and processes are rather heavy (at least when compared to user threads).
Since I haven't touched any C++ in about two months, I thought I'd try my hand at writing a quick web server to see if I can better understand some of problems. ...

The one thing I've found out is that their base plan (which only included 160 MB of memory) just isn't powerful enough to run more than a small WordPress site. I spent a bunch of time reducing the memory requirements of Apache and MySQL, but my efforts just weren't successful.

I wake up every morning to an apartment that's filled with light, and I go to sleep each night without the sound of loud sirens or drunken idiots screaming outside.
But without a doubt there's one aspect of living out here that still seems unnatural -- seeing children outside. Living in the downtown core of Vancouver you don't really see a lot of kids. Sure, you see the odd infant, or on the weekend, a few kids going to the aquarium or what-not. But it was pretty ...

When I gave my mom a hug at the end of the night she told me it's been about 10 years since I've been able to make it to her birthday, something that hadn't even crossed my mind until she had said it.

In fact, for the first few weeks I was a Grid Service user, I thought things ran actually pretty smoothly. Unfortunately though, over the next few months, things would degrade rather rapidly. My site was plagued by ever increasing latency, and would often go down for 4- 6 hours at a time due to MySQL outages or random, seemingly unannounced maintenance periods.
It got so bad at one point that I actually came to the conclusion ...

There are various ways to offset carbon, but a fairly standard one is to plant trees in exchange for money. How many trees can you plant on an acre of land? Well, turns out this guy has it all figured out, at least for poplar trees. If you space them 10' x 10', you can get around 436 trees on an acre.
The average tree consumes about 1 ton of CO2 over it's lifetime, which according to this website is around 80 years. So over the course ...

                    My walls in my new place are still pretty bare, and that's something I've been trying to fix lately. I went down to Ikea a few weeks ago a bought a pile of frames, but unfortunately finding anything to put in them has proved to be fairly difficult.
The first problem is that I don't really have great photo backups of shots I've taken. If I were smart, I would have been uploading everything to Flickr at full resolution so I could use that as my archive. Unfortunately, I haven't done that, so most of my photo originals are scattered amongst various DVDs and directories. I've always found iPhoto and ...

                    A few years ago I sat down to write my very first WordPress plugin, and ended up writing Crossroads. My goal at the time was to integrate Flickr comments into the normal comments on my blog, which was something I ultimately did. Unfortunately though, some of the limitations of the Flickr API made that feature fairly slow to use, and so it's something I ditched on my own blog a long time ago.
A few days ago I sat down and started working on version 2.0. It's a 100% complete rewrite, which given the state of the old code is definitely something that's going to improve it. I'm writing it with both ...

                    Last night I was fortunate enough to be invited to a social media gathering in the penthouse of the Loden Hotel In Vancouver. The reason for everyone coming together was to discuss how social media can help the BC Children's Hospital annual "Chip's Not Dead Yet" Memorial Mile fundraiser that takes place in Vancouver
The actual event is a one mile race where everyone is welcome to participate. Part of the fun is that people can dress up in whatever costumes they want and simply participate in an effort to help raise money for the children:

Think of this as part run, walk, parade and party. The ...

                    This is actually a pretty big deal. Most people don't realize it, but North America is one of the few places in the world that uses high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) to sweeten drinks and other items. Most other places in the world use pure glucose, which is the main sugar our bodies are built to run on. Fructose is far sweeter than glucose so you can use less of it to sweeten a product. High fructose corn syrup is typically composed of around 55% fructose and another 45% glucose. If you order a coca cola in the Caribbean, you'll notice that is has a very different (and far more enjoyable IMO) taste ...

                    Well, given that Rebecca has Surrey covered in terms of blogging, I might as well take the reins here with Chilliwack. I've spent most of my time here at home since I moved back, but I'm going to start venturing out more and more.
I've been keeping my eye out for Wi-Fi spots in town, and wanted to present a list for anyone ever looking for where they are. I'll keep updating this post over time as Chilliwack slowly emerges from the dark ages.
