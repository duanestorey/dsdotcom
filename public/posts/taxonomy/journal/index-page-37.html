                    Apparently some hotelier in India told everyone that he saw an image of the Virgin Mary in the sun, and also claimed that some of his statues were crying honey and bleeding oil in his home. Since then, nearly 50 people in India have gone completely blind while trying to look into the sun to try and see what he saw:

At least 50 people have lost their sight after staring at the sun hoping to see an image of the Virgin Mary, according to reports.

                    My new LCD arrived via FedEx this morning. I picked it up on the way to work, along with a Torx screwdriver to remove some of the internal pieces. I decided to take a stab at fixing it when I arrived, but it turns out it was far more involved than I thought.

I ended up having to disassemble the entire keyboard portion of the Macbook Pro. Afterwards, I had to disconnect the antenna for the wireless card, as well as the inverter for the monitor. Then, the data cable for the LCD came off, and finally the entire top portion that contains the screen.
At that point I was basically half-way. I then ...

While in bed tonight, I started thinking about the day I had today, the people I spent it with, and the events of this past weekend. Like a hiker nearing the end of a long trek, I forced myself to stop and survey the trail from which I've come; the moments of exhaustion, the long rainy nights, the hills and the valleys, and the painful blisters that may never fully ...

For the last 24 hours, I have essentially been in front of a computer, blogging about various topics that have interested me, and attempting to bring exposure to the realities that the homeless face in Vancouver. Rebecca and I joined forces this year to support the Union Gospel Mission, an organization in Vancouver that helps the homeless and the less fortunate in this city.

First, I want to thank the Union Gospel Mission for nearly 70 years of effort with regards to helping others. By comparison, the little that most of us get to do for charity in our ...

                    I live right near English Bay, and right now most of Vancouver is gathering outside my front door to see the second night of the fireworks. As a kid, seeing the fireworks was something I used to really enjoy. But as an adult, I don't really enjoy large crowds anymore, or fighting to get a spot to sit. That being said, I appreciate that the event brings a lot of people together from various parts of Vancouver, and the Fraser Valley.
Last year, our good pal Tony was visiting Vancouver, and we all got to hang out, drink a few beers, and watch the fireworks together. And while we didn't make it to ...

I hit a pretty rough patch this afternoon, but thankfully managed to get through it. It's been a really great experience, and it's been a privilege helping bring some awareness to the issues the homeless face in Vancouver.

Without a doubt, I'm pretty beat. My supper tonight consisted of peanuts purchased from the little store downstairs. Rebecca and John ordered Greek, but I've had so much caffeine that the thought of food basically repulses me at this point. I just poured ...

A popular manifestation of the technology I work with everyday is Skype, which many people use to communicate with each other.
One of the benefits of Skype is that the entire conversation is automatically encrypted. In theory, this should mean that nobody, not even the government, would be able to listen in on your phone calls. However, a recent article speculates that there may be a backdoor in Skype that would allow governments ...

                    Duane invited me to guest post on an environmental topic, and since I had already been mulling over the question of privatization of water, I figured I'd do some quick research. Since this is an on-the-fly post and we are both exhausted after more than 22 hours worth of Blogathon, I am not going to do my usual super awesome in-depth research, and I'm just going to point you out to a quick reference page I found.

The notion that water is a commodity kind of bugs me because I don't think we can put an actual price on natural resources. Of course, there is the theory of payment for environmental ...

                    Trans fat is the dietary equivalent of the devil. It provides no nutritional value, and reeks havoc on the body's ability to transport fats through the blood. In terms of the different types of fat that people obtain through their diet, the following effects take place:

Saturated fat raises LDL (the bad cholesterol), but basically leaves HDL (the good stuff) in tack
Polyunsaturated fat raises HDL (the good stuff), so it helps you
Monounsaturated fat typically raises HDL, but sometimes raises LDL, so while it usually is good for you, in excess it can sometimes be bad for you
Trans fat raises LDL ...

                    I did a quick tally of all the emails pledge I've received from Rebecca's site, and we're sitting at around the $400 $450 mark, which is great. Thanks to everyone who has pledged so far. My own personal goal was to try and hit $1000, and we're doing pretty good so far. There are only about ten entries left, so if you've been sitting on the fences waiting to potentially donate, now's your chance.
As I mentioned in my last entry, Matthew Good has also generously donated a signed copy of his last album, Hospital Music, which hit #1 in Canada when it was released last year. Anyone who donates at least ...

Wow. To say I am completely exhausted at this point would be an understatement. I've essentially been awake since yesterday at 9am. That means I've been awake for around 30 hours now. Blogathon ends for me at 10pm tonight, which means I still have nearly eight hours left to go. I'm really not entirely sure how I'm going to make it, but hopefully I get my third or fourth wind soon.

This Is Me When I'm Tired

                    The Tyee had an interesting piece last year where they detailed seven different ways the city could potentially help the homeless. These seven items apparently were based on real-world examples of efforts in other cities that ultimately helped.
I encourage everyone to head over to The Tyee and read the original article, but I'll give a short list here.

Idea One: Trade Fairs for the Homeless
Idea Two: Raise the Welfare Rates
Idea Three: Train Young Workers
Idea Four: Spread the Love Around
Idea Five: Buy a Few Hotel
Idea Six: Give Addicts Time to Heal
Idea Seven: Bring Governments Together

                    As you well know by now, I am supporting the Union Gospel Mission for Blogathon. The Union Gospel Mission provides assistance to the homeless people in Vancouver, and those who are in the most need. At last count, this blog has raised at least $320 or so towards the charity, and I'm hoping to bring it closer to $1000 as the event continues. As I mentioned in my last two posts, anyone that donates at least $50 to the United Gospel Mission will receive a free 8x12 print from my HDR gallery. It can be a permanent reminder for you of the contribution you made to help some of the less fortunate in ...

Sometime last night, while in the middle of a weird, sleep-deprived trance, I blogged about a community in Canada that recently converted to solar power. To show that our American friends down south can be innovative and green as well, I want to talk about another community that has recently embraced the wind.

                    Well, I imagine by now many of the early morning shift people are in full swing. It seems like so long ago I wrote my first entry, and here I am at number 28. It sure is getting difficult finding content on short notice, but I'm managing to stay ahead of the curve somehow.

My Blogathon Setup
Rebecca did a quick tally on her blog, and I think between all the participants we are up to around $500 so far. That number doesn't include people who have gone directly to their charity's website and donated directly, so ultimately the number will be a bit higher. In terms of people on this blog, we've ...
