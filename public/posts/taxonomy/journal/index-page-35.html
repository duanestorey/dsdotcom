                    Right now I'm on my second attempt at downloading Heroes, season three, episode three. I watched the first two last week, and I have to say that I wasn't overly impressed. There are a few plot holes going on that bother me, and I hope the shore up the writing a bit more in future episodes.
As I commented at the end of last season, Sylar is simply not a good bad guy anymore because he's almost invincible. The only person who can really challenge him is Peter, and we've seen that battle a few times now.
I'm still hoping this season will recreate some of the magic of the original season (in fact, ...

                    About six weeks ago, the CD player in my 2006 Mazda 3 Sport crapped out. Given that it's a new car, and that I purchased the stupid extended warranty (thanks to my lack of a backbone and the high pressure sales guy they put on me), I went in and asked them to replace it for free, which they did. Ordering the new CD player took around four weeks, but eventually I ended up with a new CD player that seemed to work fine.
Last week I got a call from Mazda asking me to come by so they can take a look at the unit they put in. I told them I wasn't having any problems with it, but they said they just wanted ...

                    I'm just heading out the door to take my car in to get looked at. There's nothing wrong mechanically with it, but Mazda called me out of the blue last week and asked me to swing by so they can look at my stereo. Apparently they might have put in the wrong one when I had it replaced about a month ago (which is strange, because it works and fits fine). I suspect there's some recall they aren't telling me about.
But anyways, they are going to replace the CD player I imagine, and they also offered to detail my car for me in exchange for the hassle.
It's supposed to be a nice sunny day out in Vancouver ...

                    Yes people, it's that time again. BarCamp Vancouver is only a few hours from kicking off down at WorkSpace in GasTown.
For those of you not familiar with it, BarCamp is an unconference where people get together and determine the topics at the conference the day of the event. Everyone who attends is potentially a speaker, so it's a great forum for learning new things and being expose to new ideas.

Rebecca Bollwitt and I are organizing a session of WordCamp tomorrow down in Granville Island, which should be a lot of fun. I currently have a desk full of WordPress swag to give out tomorrow (courtesy ...

                    Just got back from my appointment this morning. Some lady spent 20 minutes giving me impromtu eye tests, and measuring my face and eye positions. There's one tool they use to measure eye displacement which is actually slightly painful because they force it to sit on the edge of your eye socket and press it there. Unfortunately, my left orbital bone is slightly out of place so it's hard to get an accurate measurement using that device.
Anyways, once I finally talked to the surgeon, he basically indicated that another surgery at this stage is probably too risky. He said even though the end result ...

I've been on the wait list for about three months now, and I really have no idea what to expect to be honest. I went to the extra trouble to try and make sure my CT and MRI scans were there waiting for him, but I suspect that somehow they will have been lost come Wednesday, and we'll have nothing to talk about.
Truth is, I really don't know what the end result will be. Tonight I told some friends that it's really a lose-lose at this point, which is true from my perspective. Option one is ...

I actually found a pretty decent flight special late last night, and I booked it for this morning.
Unfortunately, when 5am rolled around and I had to get up for the airport this morning, I didn't really feel all that well. Plus, doing six hours worth of plane travel seemed less fun than it did the night before. ...

I've actually never been inside a brewery before, and it was a really cool experience. It's amazing how many beers Canadians are consuming every minute, something you get a sense of as the machines pump out cans of Rickard's Red and Molson Canadian.

I hardly slept at all last night and woke up feeling like I was going to throw-up, so I decided to work from home today and try to save what's left of my body here.

A quick twitter by me saying I was going to have a few casual drinks at my place led to Dave showing up for a few beers. After that, we went down to the Six Acres to meet up with Trevor, and then ultimately over to Matt's house for a few quick drinks.
When I got home that night, I realized just how tired I was. I passed out on the couch around 4am, and quite literally woke up sometime around 5pm last night. I got up here and there to answer my phone and check email, but I just couldn't force my body to wake up. ...

One of the things I've always sort of snickered about on planes is the need to still blatantly point out that smoking is not allowed on a plane. I always thought it was fairly self-evident that one shouldn't light anything while sitting on top of several thousand pounds of kerosene, but apparently I was wrong. It turns out some idiot on ...

It's an event geared towards some of Vancouver's web 2.0 saavy people and bloggers that involves sampling various beers as well as a special blogger brew that they have cooking up just for us.
It actually sounds like a ton of fun. Given that I can demolish a few beers without much effort, I think I'll definitely swing by and check it out. A few other of the night's attractions will be:

Kerry Scarsbrook &amp; Gord Rickards, creator of Rickard’s Red, will be in attendance.

                    I read the headline for an article today that said a gene has been identified that increases someone's chance to living to 100 years old by 300%. Without even reading the article or having any idea of the content, I already knew that the gene would somehow be involved with insulin signaling.
It turns out, I was 100% correct - you can read about it.
I spend every Sunday night reading the latest and greatest in medical research. And while 99% of medical research is redundant and not worth reading, the other 1% is rather fascinating, especially when you have enough pieces to put the larger puzzle ...

Time comes, time goes. Yesterday was June, and today's September. No fierce battles, only casualties. Last night I picked up a nice steak and threw it on the BBQ. Half way through cooking I ran out of propane. First time in two years that's happened. I guess change is floating in the air these days, little wisps of something else to do, somewhere else to be. The leaves will fall soon, and then the rain, and then the snow. Turn a few more weathered pages in the book and it'll be June again. Wash, rinse, repeat. It's cold in here - grab the axe and help chop down another few years for the fire.

                    Well, I'm back home.. Currently I'm lying on a bed in the spare room at my dad's house. Last night I hung out with my grandma and my mom, and then ended up drinking and playing pool at my uncle's. Unfortunately, I drank a wee-bit too much, and woke up with a splitting headache today.
I think I'm going to take a nap and then hopefully be rested up enough again to do a bit of web work. On another note, the alarm on my car has started going off for apparently no reason. I almost had to disconnect the battery the other night because I couldn't figure out how to turn it off. Turns out you have to stick ...

Using some javascript trickery I'll populate this box below with information regarding whether or not you have .NET installed. If you're on Windows, please visit this page using IE.
Can everyone please answer the poll answers after reading this post. Thanks.
For you Windows users, the box will have something like this in it:

                    This weekend I'm going to do something I haven't done in a long time -- I'm going to head home.

To be honest, I don't think I've been back to Chilliwack since easter, which is a very long time for me. I'm not entirely sure what my plans are for the whole weekend, but I'm heading back to Chilliwack at least for a few days. I might end up in Osoyoos visiting a few friends, but I'm going to hold off making any plans until after I get caught up on sleep Saturday. I'm also hoping to spend a bit of time with my grandma, since I haven't seen her in quite a while and she hasn't been feeling very well ...
