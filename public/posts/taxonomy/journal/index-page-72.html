                    It's been quite a while since I've been home on a Saturday night, and I have to say it's been a nice change. I spent most of today walking around doing errands, and tidying up at home a bit. I bought some new stainless steel pots and pans, so maybe I will actually start cooking at home again. I even made a decent batch of chilli tonight, which is pretty amazing considering I've only cooked once or twice in about six months.
My eye was bothering me quite a bit today. Most days it's pretty good and it feels normal, but today it felt all dry and scratchy, which put me in a crabby mood. I found out ...

And while I strongly encourage people to try and be kind for the rest of the year as well, this week is a chance to really up the ante a bit and see just how kind you can be to other people.
So, since it's officially Jill's challenge, let her know if you do anything out of the ordinary to try and make the world a better place next week. If you're a female ...

I've been told I can't eat for at least four hours before the scan, so apparently this banana bread is my only meal until supper time. I'm not sure if they are putting some funky dye into my blood, but I'll know in a few hours I guess.
Update -- Ok, so it's all over now. I got down to St Paul's at around 4:15pm and just chilled in the waiting area for a while. At around 4:35, some lady calls me up and walks me into the room ...

                    So I called my friend Margo the other night and asked her if she could contribute to the recent discussion on global warming and ways to reduce CO2. Margo is a good friend of mine from Chilliwack who now works in the conservation department of BC Hydro. Here's what she had to say:
There are lots of little and big things that we can all do to make a difference. The problem of global warming was created by the actions of many individuals and so the solution will also have to come from all of us. Really itâ€™s not that hard. Itâ€™s about becoming more conscious about how you live your life ...

                    In 2004, some friends and I got together and decided we would attempt to do the Vancouver Sun Run. We started our "training" that January, first doing little tiny runs around the block, then eventually moving up to hour long runs along the water in Steveston, or through the University Endowment Lands (which is an amazing place to run).
The actual run itself was really fun, but a little too crowded for my liking. I didn't expect to have a very good time, but after training for four months, I really wanted to see just how good I could get -- unfortunately, I was sidestepping people for the first ...

                    Well, yesterday I posted my CFL challenge update. So far, I only have verbal commitments from people to change a few lightbulbs this weekend and contribute some photos. But hopefully they all pull through.
As for me -- I stopped at London Drugs on the way home and bought 6 CFL lightbulbs. Surprisingly, those 6 allowed me to replace 9 normal ones in my place (since the new CFL ones are way brighter in my bathroom -- so bright that I don't need all the lights I had in there).

Here's a summary of what that did:

Power removed from incandescent bulbs: (7x40W + 2x70W) = 420W
Power added from new bulbs ...

After I came back home and demonstrated my oh-so-rusty guitar skills in front of a live audience.
This week is completely packed solid, so look forward to a pile of photos from the events.. Next update will probably be in a few days :(

I've been to Gotham before (which is also very nice), but it was my first time being at Morton's. Jason and I both agreed that it was better than Gotham, at least for the meal we had.

                    So, today I took the plunge and bought a new lens. I have been debating for a while just which I was going to get: the 24-70 f/2.8L or the 70-200mm f/2.8L. I found some guy in Vancouver who needed to sell his 70-200mm to get some cash, so that basically made the decision up for me. I saved about $500 compared to buying it new. I met him at Richmond center early this morning and did a bunch of test shots near the mall. I had my laptop with me so I could see just what this puppy could do. I was really happy with the shape of the lens (mint), and the pictures that it produced. So, I handed over the ...

                    So the day before I went into surgery in November, I walked across the stage a second time at UBC. This time, I was picking up my master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. It took me four years of part time work, and it was a real struggle, so walking across the stage finally was a big relief -- I was so happy it was finally over. I had an eye exam about an hour before the ceremony, and they were forced to dilate my eyes for some of the tests. So after four years, I couldn't even really see the ceremony I had waited to attend. I had to get someone to help me find my place in line ...

                    I've had an adsense account for around a year now. I tried putting it on the blog once, but it really seemed out of place, and who was I kidding -- nobody was really reading at that point. Nobody's really reading now, but I got bored, so I put some ads up on a few pages I thought people might hit occasionally.
So, after one full day of having adsense enabled, here are my earnings:
65 cents

                    Northern Voice is a conference geared towards personal bloggers who want to get together and share good ideas. This is the third event of this nature in Canada, and it looks like it's going to be a great event. Kasia and I both signed up today to check out the conference and meet all the other bloggers out there. The conference runs from Feb 23 - 24, out at the University of British Columbia.
As a testament to the people who are running it, they've even offered travel bursaries for those people who live out of town, but would really like to attend the event. Also, here's a testimonial about last ...

                    If you love to eat, or are in desperate need of some new recipes, check out FoodLikeThat.com. Dreamed up by internet guru Boris Mann, here's a little low-down on what it's about:

Food Like That is a new kind of recipe sharing site. It's designed to rank highly in Google. When people find your recipe, and click on the ads on your recipe page, we share the revenue with you.
But that's not really the cool part. The cool part is that it helps you find more food you like. Do you like dishes with eggs? You'll probably like quiche or maybe a frittata.
