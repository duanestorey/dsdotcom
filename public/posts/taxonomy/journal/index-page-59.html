                    Some guy on eBay bought that broken lens off me a few weeks ago. They paid promptly and everything seemed fine, so I boxed up the lens in the original box and shipped it to California.
I got an email today saying that they guy went and picked it up from the post office, only to find the box empty. So, somewhere along the way, somebody decided to help themselves.
Of course, since the lens was broken, I didn't add any extra insurance to it. That being said, I think there's at least $100 included by default. But now I have the hassle of trying to sort all this out and will probably have to refund ...

                    This is my mac.

He's pretty fun, kind of shinny, not too heavy, and he can nearly last a whole DVD without dying. But when he sleeps, he sometimes doesn't wake up. When I iPhoto him too hard, sometimes he rebels and he goes to sleep instead. When I photoshop, sometimes he chugs away doing something else, almost like "don't worry, I'll get to that eventually."
I put more ram in Mac, hoping to make him happier, but he's still sad. When he crashes, he does it slowly to rub it in, slowly fading the screen from top to bottom until he's gone. He used to do this once a month, but lately he does it more.

                    Today I made the long trek to work, but instead of having my head down with my iPod firmly attached, I decided (mainly because my iPod was dead) to keep my head up and look around. Being a single guy, my gaze routinely fell on cute girls and, to my complete disappointment, nearly all of them had a cigarette firmly attached between their fingers.

                    Slight change of plans. I was originally going to go to Toronto on the 26th, but I'm going to go to Ottawa the week before for work. So, I'll be bouncing into Toronto on the 26th, but instead of coming from Vancouver, I'll be coming in on a flight from Ottawa. That will put me into Toronto several hours earlier, which should take a bit of pressure off with having to get downtown from the airport.

I'll be staying out in Kanata in a really great hotel called The Brookstreet Hotel, which just happens to be owned by Terry Matthews (whose company recently merged with ours). Apparently Terry and/or ...

                    I had a meeting with my plastic surgeon today to talk about the last surgery I had. It's been a little over five months now, so in terms of results, everything should be stable.
In my opinion, the position of my eye, while better, is still not perfect. In addition, I still have double vision in the top-left version of my visual field. My plastic surgeon did a few simple tests on me, mainly involving looking at my eye and tracking its movement using a finger.
At least to my surgeon, the results are acceptable and do not warrant another surgery. For now, I have a few referrals to some eye doctors ...

                    As I mentioned in my last blog entry, the other day I had a chance to photography my first wedding. All in all, it was a pretty rewarding experience.
The day started at around 11am for me and Hesty. We suited up, did some last minute charging of equipment, and then got in touch with the groom. Normally the photographer heads over to the where the bride is getting ready for some photos, but Kim's aunt wanted to do those ones, so I was relieved of that duty.
We met Mike and the groomsmen down at the Holiday Inn in Langley to get ready. In true Chilliwack style, Mike, instead of hopping in the shower ...

I'll do a full write-up on everything I learned about shooting a wedding, but right now I have a turkey to eat. I shot over 1000 shots at the wedding, and I've slowly been sorting them. I put about 150 or so of them on Flickr if anyone is interested. There are still more I have to process and put together, but there's enough that it's fairly good representation ...

                    Last night, out of sheer boredom, I drove down to Future Shop and picked up Season one of Heroes, on HD-DVD.

Rebecca and John have been recommending this series to me, so I figured I would just go along with their word of mouth and pick it up.
I'm about half way through season one already, and so far I think it's pretty good. A few of the characters I find a bit annoying, but the Tokyo guy who can bend space and time is always entertaining, as well as the guy who can read minds. I'm anxiously awaiting the Heroes to step up and start being cool, but maybe that's what season two is all about. ...

I was completely clear in the description that the item doesn't work, and that it would require major repair. But still, I'm completely astounded that someone would pay that much for what I perceive as basically a paper-weight.

                    Last night I was released from St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver to continue the healing process at home. I won't make this a long entry becuase frankly, I find it physically rather hard to type and concentate for writing emails and things right now.
The whole episode that led me to head to the hospital is as follows. On Saturday night I was finding myself really short of breath at home. Plus, no matter what medication I took, I just couldn't seem to get my fever to come down. I hit a point when it hit 39C and my heart rate wouldn't settle down and I thought to myself that something was very, very ...

                    Friday morning, I woke up with a rather large fever, and spent the first hour or two hugging a toilet. I was feeling pretty defeated, so I called my mom out in Chilliwack and asked her to come out and spend the night with me.
It's been really great. They made me a meal, looking after me, did my laundry, and tried to do what they could to make me feel better. I went to bed, and actually had a pretty decent sleep. Unfortunately, I had a really large fever upon waking up today, and realized that something wasn't really right.
I went down to the walk in clinic with Marty, which was a challenge since ...

                    After work, I was feeling a bit tired so I laid down for a quick nap. When I woke up a few hours later, not only did I have a wicked headache, most of my joints hurt too. I've since turned the heat up in my apartment to around 28C, and I'm still shivering on the couch with some blankets on.
The next couple days are pretty busy for me, so I can't really afford to be sick. I'm going to head to bed now and hopefully wake up at a reasonable hour. My cute maid is coming again in the morning -- so exciting. ...

                    Is it just me, or was this one of the shittiest summers we've had in a long time? It seems like anytime I looked out my window in the morning with thoughts of doing something outdoors it was either cold or rainy. Obviously today is no exception.

Interestingly enough, while down in the Dominican Republic, most people there said the same thing -- that this was one of the worst summers they can remember. I'm fairly certain the UK set a rain record this summer, based on something I heard and read while down in the Caribbean.
Unlike most of my friends, I'm not particular fond ...

                    Years ago, while looking for something to read along the lines of fantasy, I encountered the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. Jordan's writing style is similar to Tolkien's in that he takes great efforts to relate back stories and flesh out all his characters. While I lost interest in the series a few years ago (mainly due to my impatience for waiting for a book to be written), I did enjoy it tremendously when I first started.
Today, Robert Jordan passed away from complications from primary amyloidosis. Rest in peace. ...

                    Years ago, had I gone to the dentist with a chip in my tooth, they probably would have just polished it up a bit with the grinder and sent me home. Thankfully, with all the advances in material science, that is no longer the case.
I had a scheduled cleaning with my dentist today, and just in passing I mentioned the chip in my tooth that I somehow obtained in Ottawa. It wasn't really that visible, and mostly was just a small annoyance to me (since it had a different texture when I rubbed my tongue along it). However, once he took a look at it, he told me that he would fix it for me using ceramics.
So, ...
