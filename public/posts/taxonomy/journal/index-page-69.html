                    Well, in just a few hours, yours truly will be turning 30. I originally set out last night to write something memorable, and spent a few hours writing a blog entry that I hoped would detail the last ten years of my life. However, upon waking up this morning, I realized that it wasn't really what I wanted to say, probably because I think it was heavily influenced by the events of the last six months.
The truth is, this has probably been the hardest year of my life. Between a big breakup, that assault in November, a surgery and some other personal things in my life, it was really quite a challenge ...

                    Yesterday, partly by chance, and later by design, I found that I didn't log into an IM client for nearly the entire day. No Jabber, no Yahoo, no Windows Live or whatever they are calling it now -- just me, alone with my machine.
And it was everything that I thought it would be.
Now let me just tell you what a typical day is like for me on IM. I have, quite easily, well over 100 people on my IM client. A small percentage of these are personal (friends and family), but without a doubt, the majority are business related. During a typical work day, I'd say 70 of them or so are online and working in ...

Rob is part of a team that has taken it upon themselves to bike from Kelowna to Vancouver, a distance of roughly 400 kms (a route that goes through not one, but two large mountain passes), in one day to raise money for cancer research.

                    So yesterday, I met up with Jessica, Brennen, Kaedy, Michele, Jeff, Maya, Margo and Robbie, and the troop of dogs down in Steveston. In the old days, we started this day called "Friends Day", where we would schedule in a day to hang out with our old high school friends. It sounds a bit lame, but with everyone's time constraints, we found if we didn't set aside time to hang out, it never happened.
So, even though yesterday wasn't actually a friend's day, we still managed to all meet out in Steveston for a few hours of hanging out. Brennen and Jessica recently had baby Kaedy, and Jeff and Michele ...

Last night a bunch of us from work decided to get together and have a few beers. Unfortunately for me, a few beers turned into a pile of beers, a few rums, some wine, more rums, and finally some drunken blogging. All and all, a good night out, but I'm definitely getting too old to drink at that pace anymore.
I spent most of today lounging around my house, cleaning a bit, eating a bit, but for the most part I just took ...

                    For some reason, I'm one of those people that rarely dreams. Or rather, I'm told, I rarely remember what it is I dream about, because apparently everyone dreams every night. Lately, I've found myself dreaming alot more. Sometimes the dreams are good, and I'm almost sad to wake up from them. But also, I've been having some nasty ones that I just can't seem to shake.
When I was a kid, I had a bunch of work done on my teeth. They pulled four out to make some room, added some weird device to the roof of my mouth to help hold things in place, and of course, I had the token installation of braces for ...

                    So that stupid opacity problem has finally pissed me off enough to start to do something about it. There has to be a bug in my theme somewhere that's doing it, but I haven't been able to pinpoint it exactly. For now I'm switching to this theme, even thought it's a bit buggy too (it's only temporary)..
Actually, after disabling my theme and all plugins, the problem still exists in other themes.. I've only noticed it on my mac using Camino or Firefox, so I wonder if there's something wrong there.. I don't see the problem on a PC. Grr...

So, last night I grabbed my camera and went to check out what Vancouver looks like at night. ...

                    So as most of you already know, in less than two weeks time, I'm going to be turning 30. No, I will not be starting any fires in Vancouver with the heat from my birthday cake, but I will be drinking no doubt in some bar somewhere with some of my friends. 30 is a really a strange birthday. As I approach it, I'm not really sad about it, but I am aware of the weight of it. I think it makes you look back on a pretty important chapter of your life and evaluate where you were, where you are, and hopefully where you're still going. As Kris said a few weeks ago over beers, "a decade will do that to you."

A few emails have been passed around, and some of those have ultimately lead into online conversations via IM. What bothers me the most is that there's this trend where people initiate a chat with you, and then are either too busy or too uninterested to spend time chatting. For example, this one girl will always IM me whenever she sees me and ask to chat. So I say sure.. Then, I spend 5 - 10 minutes waiting around for her one or two word response to every essay I write. ...

                    I'm pretty bagged, so this will be short. The flight leaving Heathrow was pretty much a complete clusterfuck. Apparently they were out of gates, so they just parked the 747 on the concrete a mile away and had to shuttle us all there in small groups.. We took off around an hour late.. About an hour into it, we had some pretty wicked turbulence, which for someone who hates flying basically unnerved me.
I popped a few sleeping pills when we hit altitude and managed to sleep for most of the flight home (surprisingly, because I had an aisle seat, and nobody asked me to get up so they could go to the ...

I just demolished my first beer here in the Oulu airport, and am now working on beer #2 waiting patiently for my plane to board. I've spent the last hour researching cool spots to go drink beer tonight in Helsinki, and I have a few in mind that I'm going to check out later.. I can't be too drunk or out too late tonight since I have lots to do in London tomorrow, but I'm going to do my best to drink as the locals do. Jari and Seppo impressed me with their drinking ability the other ...

                    I approximately 24 hours, I'll be stepping off a plane at Heathrow and rushing madly to see some of London before my connecting flight to Vancouver leaves in the early evening. I think I'll probably only have about 3 and a half hours to see London, which I'm sure doesn't give me much time to see very much. With the time constraints, it looks like I'm gonna shell out $100 for the express train that goes from the airport to Paddington Station near central London. From there, I'm really not sure what I'm going to do. It still seems like quite a haul to get to any of the attractions, so I imagine ...

                    I've been in Oulu, Finland for a few days now, and thankfully last night I actually got to go out and see a few things. Jari and Seppo were nice enough to take me to a pretty fancy Russian restaurant last night where we had some great food, nice wine, and of course some type of random vodka shot. Afterwards, we sort of started our own mini pub crawl, checking out a few of the bars in the Oulu downtown. I really love the architecture over here. I'm not sure how you'd really describe it, but everything is really quant and different looking. Last night was pretty cool because there was this fog over ...

                    So my body decided that it would take a brief unscheduled break from sleeping at around 2am this morning.. I decided in that time I would throw a few photos up from yesterday (I don't have that many). Oulu is pretty quaint so far, and I'm actually really eager to walk around and see some things (since the architecture looks really cool from my hotel window). I have to be on-site around 9 this morning (which means I need to get back to sleep), but afterwards I think my hosts are all taking me for dinner. For the most part, my digital SLR has been in my backpack most of the time. I took a few shots ...

When I lived in Ottawa, there were times when I used to get a little homesick and miss Vancouver and Chilliwack. When that happened, I was fortunate enough to stumble across a little website called KatKam.ca. It's a live webcam that points into the direction of the evening sunset, only a block or so away from my apartment in Vancouver. To this day, I always religiously check it out from time to time when I'm out of town, just to see what I'm missing back home.
Here's a shot of the sunset tonight that I missed. I'm heading to the airport now to fly up North. See you guys in about a week. ...
