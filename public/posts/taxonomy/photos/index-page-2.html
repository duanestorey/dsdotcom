                I've had gravatars on this site a few times over the last few years, but they always seem to disappear whenever I do a retheming. I've added them back in the comments and also added the last comment to the main page along with a gravatar.
If you don't have a photo next to your name when you comment, that means you don't have a public gravatar available. If you want one, head over to Gravatar.com and sign up. It's free, and as soon as you add your photo to it you will start noticing it automatica...

                So Leila just came up to me at work today and said congrats. I said "for what?" And she said she was recently on an Air Transat flight and came across a pile of photos in the middle of the in-flight magazine from my last trip to the Dominican Republic. She said they all said "photo by Duane Storey", and that she was sure they were mine.
Funny thing is I had no idea they had been published. I know Air Transat has a section where users can submit their photos for consideration, which I did after c...

                So, I know there are a bunch of programs available on the Mac for doing photo work and what not, but I'd like to ask everyone what they use on a daily basis. I have for the most part made due with iPhoto, but the organization capabilities of it suck, and I end up with directories full of photos without any real means to identify them. Unfortunately, I also need something with a relatively quick workflow (photoshop is too slow to use for me except in extreme cases).
Any recommendations?...

                As everyone who hits my blog these days knows, I really like taking photos. My passion for photography started about seven years ago, and is still going strong today. I've been fortunate enough to be able to afford a really nice camera and a full suite of lenses, and while I sort of understand what's needed to take "good" photos, my camera really does the majority of the heavy lifting.
My friends routinely use my photos in blog posts (which I really appreciate), but every once and a while I do a...

                So tonight I felt like having a few drinks, so I pinged Rebecca online and asked if it was ok if I showed up with a bunch of booze. In pure Surrey girl fashion, she said "yeah sure."
I spent the night hanging out with Rebecca and John, laughing my ass off to Canadian Top Models and some Comedy Show on the TV. I don't do simple things like that enough these days, and it's always nice just to relax on someone else's couch from time to time.
While outside, we were privileged enough to see a weird n...

                About 18 months ago, I picked up the Canon EOS 20D to replace my dying Canon Powershot camera. Stepping up from a point and shoot to a digital SLR was a pretty big step for me at the time, since I had never even really used an SLR camera before. I made a rookie mistake when I got it, and instead of buying a nice lens to go onto it, I picked up a cheap Sigma zoom lens. I spent the first few weeks completely disappointed with my camera, thinking that my point and shoot pictures were nearly as good...
