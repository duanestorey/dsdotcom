                One of the first things I did when I committed myself to travelling around the world was to set up a blog. Indeed, I recently just assisted two other people in getting theirs up, one for a trip around the world, and one for a yearly RV trip down to Arizona. This post will give you easy instructions for how to set up a blog using WordPress.
Part of the motivation I find with most people is the desire to share some of their experiences, both positive and negative, with others. Since so much of tra...

                I've recently been optimizing a few different WordPress websites, and wanted to share with everyone some of the easy ways to speed up your WordPress website. Some of these tips are intended for server administrators and assume that you have root access to your server and/or cPanel/WHM (if you're using cPanel). Other tips are intended for any WordPress website administrator.

While I've tried off and on to make a little money from my website over the years, it's never been something that was really important to me, primarily because I have another full time job that makes me more than enough money. Another reason is that I personally am not a huge fan of most advertising, as I find a lot of it to be intrusive.
That said, travelling around the world and writing about it isn't cheap. I likely spend anywhere from $6,000 a year ...

                One of my goals over the holidays was to rework my personal website. I actually really liked the previous theme, but over the course of the last six months or so have received numerous emails from people that either a) didn't like the black background or b) didn't like the font usage and sizes (granted, I actually like really tiny fonts, which isn't that great from a usability perspective).

                It's been about three days since I launched the new site, and I've had some great feedback regarding it (thanks everyone). I've made a few small tweaks based on some comments, so hopefully it's a bit better.
I've been watching my traffic, and so far I've consistently about double the traffic (actually, a tad bit more) since launching. I'm sure part of that is a transient contribution from launching a new site and Twittering about it, but I'm fairly certain the traffic will definitely go up, sinc...

                I was catching up on Tony's site tonight and stumbled across this photo of Tony from 2006. Apparently he ended up on Hot Chicks With Douche Bags back then, which I think is awesome.

Tony spends his days injecting massive amounts of awesome into the LA Times as the head of their 40-some odd blogs, and his nights attending cool music and social events in Los Angeles, so I think it's pretty funny he'd end up there. But hey, getting your photo taken with a cute girl is always a good thing.

                Well, it was an interesting day in the blogosphere, one that I'm thankful is over. Tonight I was sitting at home debating drinking myself into a coma when Rebecca pinged me online and said I should come over for wine. I was pretty comfy in my flannel pants and briefly debated staying at home. But since I really needed a few drinks, I decided to head over as I was, flannel pants and all. So for the last few hours I've been sitting on Rebecca and John's couch in my flannel pants with a big-ass afg...

                I set up a small photography website over at photography.duanestorey.com a while ago. I think I'm going to over haul it this weekend and make it a bit better. I also want to get a domain name for it and make it a proper stand-alone site. If anyone has any ideas for a cool name for a photography site, fire me off an email. I've been trying to come up with west-coast oriented names, but so far no go.
I'll give a free 8x12 print and a blog entry on the new site for the person that picks the winner!...

I'm going to give the first 20 people who link to it with a small write-up a free 8x12 of their choosing from the galleries. So, if you're interested, do a quick blog entry and then post a comment here. Send me an email with which one you want and where you want it sent to, and I'll take care of the rest.

I'm not entirely sure I'll make a dime, but lots of people have asked me if I sold some of my city shots, so now I can finally say that I do.

I've set up a professional account at smugmug.com where I can put some of my better photos from around Vancouver and make them available for purchase. This will also let me sell wedding photos etc when the time comes.
I'll post more information when it's all done....
