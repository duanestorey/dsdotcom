                I finished my presentation about an hour ago, and have just been drinking a bit of beer since then. I just wrote a little post over at BraveNewCode about a cool little addition I had for my WordCamp Portland presentation, and wanted to post about it here. Both Andrew Sampson and comedian Stephen Fry contributed some data and a video for my presentation, talking about WPtouch and WordPress. It was very much appreciated, and was extremely well received down here.

                Almost time to get in a plane. Tomorrow night I'll pack everything up and get ready for a trip down to the states on Friday. Definitely looking forward to the weekend, and also being on the other side of it since it's the last real event of the summer before I can downshift a few gears and take things a bit slower again.

I probably won't post again until WordCamp, but who knows....

                Ahh yes, the end of a long weekend. And not just any long weekend, the last long weekend of the summer. So long summer of 2009, it was nice to know you.
My niece and nephew head back to school tomorrow, which is sort of exciting for them. I always liked going back to school for some reason. Maybe it was buying a whole new batch of school supplies, or seeing some of your friends again after a summer apart. Granted, after about a week I was sick of the new year, but that first week was usually fun...

                I just finished booking my flight to WordCamp Portland, so I figured now was a good time to write a post about it. I was a co-organizer for two WordCamp Vancouver events, as well as one up in Whistler, but strangely enough I haven't actually spoken at a WordCamp for almost about two years now. So having me up front should make for some interesting entertainment.
I'll be speaking on mobile blogging, with an emphasis on our WPtouch plugin. I'll probably also talk a bit about mobile blogging in gen...

                I was looking at my schedule tonight, trying to figure out where I have to be and when. Here's what it's currently looking like:

Sep 3 - 7, Camping at the Lake
Sep 10 - 13, Canadian Country Music Awards, Vancouver
Sep 18 - 20, Speaking at WordCamp Portland
Sep 24 - 28, Friends from Ontario in town

So basically every single weekend in September is already jam packed. I still haven't decided whether or not I'm flying to Portland or driving. Considering I just drove to Portland a while ago, I'm l...

                I'm going to overhaul this website again, most likely starting in July. To be perfectly honest, writing content just isn't as satisfying as it once was, partially because I don't have as much to write these days, and partially because I am just enjoying other aspects of my life more (such as going outside to hit some tennis balls around or heading up to the lake for lunch). Something I've always wanted on this blog, and that I've never really been able to achieve, is to have something that's pre...
