                    Tonight I met up with the gang to celebrate Amy's birthday down at Wing's on Granville Street. We had a few pitchers of beer and demolished somewhere on the order of 16 pounds of wings as a group (I'm now officially "winged out", so I probably won't go back there for a while). It was tons of fun, even though I ate that one hot wing that melted my mouth.

Afterwards we ended up down at the Bowling Alley on Granville and played a few games. My head was still a tad sore from the night before (the danger of drinking for free at a bar), so my game was a bit off.

I took a pile of photos the night before ...

                    Well, it's almost the weekend again. I awoke this morning to some major construction going on in one of the units around me, and I sure hope it's done before Saturday morning rolls around.
Last night I hit Wings on Granville with Rebecca, Keira and John. For those of you who haven't been, it's a quaint little spot next to the Howard Johnson hotel on Granville Street that has cheap wings from 2-6pm daily.

The girls basically did two pitchers of beer by themselves, so I imagine they were feeling pretty tipsy by the time they left.
This weekend is already shaping ...

                    Ahh yes.. Friday.. So exciting.. This was a really good week. I hung out with friends, got some stuff done in the office, and have a pile of fun things to do this weekend. After work I'm meeting up with Rebecca, Kasia and maybe Keira for some wings and beer. Life's rough I know. Plus on the way over I want to buy a flash diffuser over at Leo's Camera on Granville, something that I used at the last wedding I shot and wished I actually owned.
Tomorrow there are two parties, one for Rebecca's birthday and one for Kasia's. I have to make appearances at both, but I think I can pull it off. And on Sunday ...
