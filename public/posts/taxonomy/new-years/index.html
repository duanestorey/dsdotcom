                    Well, I made it. I had originally been scheduled to fly out on the 2nd of January, but since I figured everyone would be tired and hungover on the 1st that I'd just head back then and get rested up for the grind again. After everyone left the hotel, I called West Jet to see if there were any openings on any flights. Pretty much the only one that worked was the 7am flight out of Toronto. Since it was already 4am, I figured I might as well just head to the airport and sleep on the plane.
Of course, once I got to the airport nothing was really open and the line ups were already pretty big. I did ...

                    Well, that's it folks -- 2007 is basically all over. For me, it was undoubtedly one of the hardest years in my life. I have usually always been able to find the good in things that sometimes turn out bad, but this last year is one that for the most part I am happy to leave behind.

That being said, I have lots of good memories from this last year. Rob's wedding. Massey Hall show in Toronto. Crazy halloween eyeball smashing party. Las Vegas. The Dominican Republic. Drunk Camp. Finland. New friends. Old friends.
Tomorrow night I'll be bouncing around Toronto, and for the first time in quite a few ...

                    I spent most of the morning in bed on my second day of Toronto, which was fine by me since the bed here is super comfy. The rest of the day is pretty much a blur for me. Tony and I met Christie for lunch, and then walked around and did a bit of shopping. I picked up a nice scarf and Tony got some gloves and a hat, so we're both officially winter people now.

After that I went back to the hotel and had a little nap prior to the little hockey game party we had at my hotel.

I wasn't planning on getting super loaded, but somehow between the lack of food in my stomach, the martini Raymi made for me ...

                    Well, judging from the beer bottles all around me and the chinese food stain on the bed, I think I had a pile of fun last night. I did my best to keep track of how many beers I had via facebook, but it looks like I lost count at the end or had trouble counting.
I went with Raymi and Phil to the hospital when I arrived in the hotel since she hasn't been feeling that well. There they gave my a Christmas present, which included this cute little guy that plays the guitar (thanks guys, I'll post a photo later).

After that, Raymi and I started our nacho-fest with some down at Sneaky Dees.

                    In Toronto and in the hotel. Fuckers gave me a king sized bed when I asked specifically for two doubles or whatever. Still an ongoing battle there. I changed my seat around prior to the flight so that hopefully nobody was going to be sitting next to me. Thankfully that plan came together and I had the whole row to myself. About 2 seconds after lifting up I made a make-shift bed out of all three seats and someone managed to sleep for most of the flight.
Just waiting for Raymi to come pick me up from the hotel and the adventure will begin. ...
