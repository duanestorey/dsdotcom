                Rebecca Bollwitt is one of those rare people who doesn't need an introduction. Her Vancouver blog, Miss604.com, is well known in Canada and parts of the United States, and has been voted the #1 Vancouver blog for the last four years. Rebecca has organized several conferences in the Vancouver area, including two WordCamps, several Twestivals, and several blog-until-you-pass-out 24-hour sessions of Blogathons.
Not only is Rebecca actively involved with Vancouver and her website, but her and her hu...

                Last year my friend Dave got his genetic profile done up by 23andMe. Basically they can take a saliva sample, extract your DNA from it, and then compare it against all the current research in the field of genetics.
When they originally launched they were asking over $400 for each profile. I've been patiently waiting for a sale to get mine done, and eventually managed to find a coupon to bring the cost down to $99. So right before leaving to Thailand I mailed off a saliva sample to California and...

                If there is one person in particular who has inspired my travels to date, it would be Scott Hadfield. Scott discovered he had the ability to work remotely years ago, and left to go explore the world while still working for a North American company. He would show up in Vancouver from time to time, but mostly he was working remotely in Buenos Aires or South Africa.
I was recently planning a trip to New Zealand for the fall when Scott and his wife Samantha informed me they were going to be having a...

                Prior to leaving on my first travel adventure, there were a few key people that helped inspire me to leave my North American life behind. One such person is a good Vancouver friend of mine, Robert Scales.
Here's Robert's latest BIO:

                This is the first post in an ongoing series where I'll be featuring a few of the travellers I've encountered on the road or whose web sites I've frequented during my travels.
First up is Alexandra Kovacova, also known as the CrazySexyFunTraveler. I've chatted with Alex a few times on Twitter about travel, and asked her a few questions which she graciously answered for this post:

First, what's your name and where are you originally from?
My name is Alexandra Kov·Ëov· and I was born in a small...
