                My blog appears to be in some weird state of limbo right now, bouncing between the black and the white background, depending on where you are viewing it from. It's rather strange, considering the TTL on my DNS entry is 30 minutes, so it shouldn't take this long at all.
Anyways, here is a trailer for season 3 or Heroes. I hope Peter keeps his shirt on for more of it.

                Yes people, today is a great day in TV land. Jack Bauer, aka Kiefer Sutherland, was released from jail after serving 48 days for drunken driving.
Now I gotta say -- getting in a car while loaded is a dumb thing to do. I can openly admit I did it as a young adult once and a while, something as a grown adult I now look back on and realize how dumb it was. The trick is of course to plan ahead, otherwise you'll find yourself stuck in the boonies with no way home. Now, I just refuse to get into situa...

                WARNING - MAJOR SPOILER ALERT: I've said it before, and I'll say it again - you can't have a show based on heroes that are near invincible. You just can't. Heroes have to be flawed, or have some element that makes them weak, otherwise there's really nothing for an audience to identify with. Peter is the prime example - he's really unstoppable, and while I used to get excited seeing him onscreen, now he just takes up screen time, mostly with a bunch of whiny morality. The only person who can real...

                Looks like the first shots of KITT are out from the upcoming TV series based on the old show Knight Rider.
 From here.
As you can see, it's a Ford Shelby GT. Personally, I think it looks rather stupid, but that's just me.
Maybe I'm just a bit nastalgic, and miss the old version of KITT....

                Well, it's not very often I'll write about TV shows, mainly because I don't really watch a lot of TV. In an effort to get my expenses down a few months ago, I decided finally to pull the plug on cable, something that I haven't regretted in the least. The only show I really watched last year was 24, and once that season ended, I just cancelled it all, saving myself $60 a month or whatever.
A while ago, I went out and bought all of Heroes season one on HD-DVD. I thought it was a decent show, but t...
