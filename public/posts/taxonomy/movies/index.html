                    Back in the summer Future Shop had a sale on the extended BlueRay versions of the Lord Of the Rings. Given that they were basically 50% off and that I know I eventually wanted to buy a BlueRay player, I decided to buy a set.
Now that I'm back in Canada, I went out and finally bought a BlueRay player. I sat down over the Christmas break to watch a few of them, and I can say without a doubt that the quality of the films in excellent.
But what seems absolutely incredible to me is how each disc has 5 or 6 crappy trailers that you are forced to watch whenever you put one of the discs in. The disc menu ...

My recent trip to Mexico gave me my first real opportunity to use my iPad on a travel adventure. I haven't really had a lot of time to try watching movies or TV shows on it, and thought it would be fun to try watching a movie on the plane instead of paying for an inflight movie on WestJet.
I loaded my iPad up with Mission Impossible III, Dances with Wolves (I had a copy floating around) and a few new episodes of House. I also made sure I charged the device up to 100% before leaving for the airport.
The first great thing about having the iPad loaded with movies is that you can watch them whenever ...

                    I have a portable hard drive that I'm taking with me on my travels, partially to back up my main laptop from time to time, and partially because it contains a large percentage of my personal movie collection on it.
That said, I'm going to try and get a pile of movies on there that I haven't seen yet so I have something when I'm on train rides or in hostels and what-not.
So, I'd appreciate it if people can leave a list in the comments of some of their favourite movies, or anything they've seen in the last few years they thought was really awesome. Thanks! ...

                    I had a rough sleep the other night, so I was a bit tired yesterday. I passed out on the couch for a bit in the late afternoon and early evening, and woke up just long enough to grab some McDonald's for supper. Afterwards I started watching a bit of Lost, but could hardly keep my eyes open. I strolled into bed at around 9pm last night, thinking I would read for a while. Apparently I passed out, because next thing I knew it was about 4am in the morning. By the time the night was over, I had slept 11 hours, which is a pretty long sleep for me.
I'm just taking it easy this weekend. I have a WordCamp ...

                    I just got back from watching Sherlock Holmes with my dad here in Chilliwack. Strangely enough, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie in the theatre, let alone a movie in the Chilliwack theatre. In true retro style, the Chilliwack theatre has yet to discover the true beauty that is cup-holders, but no matter.
I really had no expectations with regards to the movie, but found that I really enjoyed it. I find it a little implausible that Sherlock appears to be a bit of a martial artist, but I guess you can't be a hero nowadays without knowing a bit of kung-fu or karate. Truthfully, there were ...

                    I rented a pile of movies on the weekend, mostly older flicks I had already seen before. That being said, I went over to my brother-in-law's house on Friday and watched District 9 and Bruno.
District 9 was completely unexpected, and I'm not even sure what I thought of it to be honest. Overall I enjoyed it, and it was the first movie to surprise me in a long time, probably since From Dusk til Dawn. Without a doubt, you can see Peter Jackson's hand in the movie, especially with the parallels to his own mockumentary, Forgotten Silver (that caused a lot of controversy when it came out), and some of ...

                    Peter Jackson's next film is "The Lovely Bones", based on the novel with the same name. I haven't read the book, but I understand the basic premise -- a young girl is murdered, and she watches the aftermath of her life from the great beyond. Other than that, I don't really know that much. But given how much I liked Lord of the Rings, I'm anxious to see how Peter Jackson does with a new film. Truthfully, I thought his King Kong remake was a little weak.

If I do watch a movie, I'll probably pop in the extended edition of the Fellowship Of The Ring, since I haven't watched it in ages. What better way to spend your weekend than going on a 12 hour journey into the heart of Middle Earth?

                    This isn't really a huge surprise to me, but apparently BlueRay sales aren't doing very well at all. In fact, sales of BlueRay went down last month compared to the month before.
There are probably a lot of reasons why other people aren't buying them, namely the high price of current BlueRay players. But in terms of me, I'm not buying one simply because I'm still pissed off from the whole HD-DVD/BlueRay battle. On my shelf at home is a now useless HD-DVD player, which I purchased thinking HD-DVD would be around a little while longer. Since the industry basically screwed consumers with that whole ...

I actually found a pretty decent flight special late last night, and I booked it for this morning.
Unfortunately, when 5am rolled around and I had to get up for the airport this morning, I didn't really feel all that well. Plus, doing six hours worth of plane travel seemed less fun than it did the night before. ...

Please, for the love of god, stop making movies. Whatever magic you used to bring to the table evaporated a long time ago.
As you can tell, I saw the new Indiana Jones movie on the weekend. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy it, and found myself looking at my cell phone from time to time to see how much more I had to endure.
