                We're up to about $530 now. I'm hoping we can hit $1000, which means we basically need about $100 an hour. That's a big goal, and I'll need the help of every reader to pull it off. If you want to know more information about the United Gospel Mission, please head over to their website or send me a personal email via my contact page.

                I've been messing around with the iPhone 3G pretty much non-stop for the last 24 hours. For the most part, it has exceeded my expectations.

First, being able to check your email or surf the web from any location is a pretty awesome feature. For example, today I was at the beach with some friends and we noticed that the tide was slowly creeping up the shore.

                My wireless connection at home is made possible by the WRT54G router, which is a pretty popular router for reasons I'll explain. When the router first came out, inquisitive people soon found out that it was based on a modified Linux distribution. Since Linux is GPL, the people using the WRT54G put pressure on the makers of the router to release the firmware for it via open source, since to not do so would be in violation of the GPL license.
