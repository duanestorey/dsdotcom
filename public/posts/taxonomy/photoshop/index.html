                    I had a bit of time yesterday (really, I didn't, but the creative juices were flowing and I wanted to start dabbling), so I started tinkering with some ideas for a new theme for this site. While I routinely update the theme on this site (I average about every four months or so), I really want the next one to be up here for quite some time, so I'm not going to rush development on it.
I have a few basic goals for the new theme:

The theme should put more focus on aspects of my life such as photography, and less on my other content
The theme will focus more on my life, and some of my passions (such ...

                    It should come as no surprise that photoshop is a much better tool that iPhoto. iPhoto is a free package that ships with Tiger and Leopard, and allows you to do quick adjustments to your photos. While obviously not marketed towards a high-end market, it's easy to use and is a fairly decent tool to have a in your photography arsenal.
Unfortunately, sometime around Leopard, my iPhoto experience seemed to get a lot worse. I never really figured out exactly what happened, but there was a clean point in time where I felt iPhoto started really underperforming.

I'm so far behind on everything, it's not even funny. Being in the hospital set me back over a week, and my recent trip out east set me back even further. I'm going to try and use this weekend to catch up. Here's what I need to do.

Tidy apartment and do laundry. I hate this part.
Unfuck photoshop some how
Mail photos to everyone
Backup computer and free some space
Install XP via boot camp so I can play games
Finish wedding photos for Mike and Kim (sorry guys)
Answer a bazillion emails that I haven't yet. If I haven't answered you, I'm sorry :( If I have, feel lucky!
Drink some booze to celebrate ...

                    I've been messing around a bit more with photoshop in the evenings, and one day soon I'll read the huge 1000 page book I have on it as well. Here's something I was messing with a bit last night. It's a shot from my patio looking easy towards Yaletown. The bridge is the Granville Street Bridge.

The whole image involved work on about 5 different layers in photoshop. The rain was a bit trickier than I imagined, and it's not entirely convincing, but it's a good start. ...
