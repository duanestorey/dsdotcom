                I had a bit of time yesterday (really, I didn't, but the creative juices were flowing and I wanted to start dabbling), so I started tinkering with some ideas for a new theme for this site. While I routinely update the theme on this site (I average about every four months or so), I really want the next one to be up here for quite some time, so I'm not going to rush development on it.
I have a few basic goals for the new theme:

The theme should put more focus on aspects of my life such as photogr...

                It should come as no surprise that photoshop is a much better tool that iPhoto. iPhoto is a free package that ships with Tiger and Leopard, and allows you to do quick adjustments to your photos. While obviously not marketed towards a high-end market, it's easy to use and is a fairly decent tool to have a in your photography arsenal.
Unfortunately, sometime around Leopard, my iPhoto experience seemed to get a lot worse. I never really figured out exactly what happened, but there was a clean point...

I'm so far behind on everything, it's not even funny. Being in the hospital set me back over a week, and my recent trip out east set me back even further. I'm going to try and use this weekend to catch up. Here's what I need to do.

Tidy apartment and do laundry. I hate this part.
Unfuck photoshop some how
Mail photos to everyone
Backup computer and free some space
Install XP via boot camp so I can play games
Finish wedding photos for Mike and Kim (sorry guys)
Answer a bazillion emails that I h...

                I've been messing around a bit more with photoshop in the evenings, and one day soon I'll read the huge 1000 page book I have on it as well. Here's something I was messing with a bit last night. It's a shot from my patio looking easy towards Yaletown. The bridge is the Granville Street Bridge.

The whole image involved work on about 5 different layers in photoshop. The rain was a bit trickier than I imagined, and it's not entirely convincing, but it's a good start....
