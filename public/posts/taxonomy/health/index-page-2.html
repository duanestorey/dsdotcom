                So while many of us suffer from the end products of love, and some of us end up broken hearted, my friend Clay is the only guy I know who actually has, quite literally, a broken heart.
Photo from here.
Clay is currently down at St. Paul's hospital getting a coronary bypass operation. Not a very enjoyable way to spend Valentine's day. I just called down and he's still in surgery. I'll probably swing by later tonight if he's out of the ICU, or more than likely tomorrow. If anyone has that stupid f...

                My first MRI was actually fair bit shittier than I imagined. I got to the hospital about 40 minutes before my scheduled time, and went to the Jim Pattison pavilion (like I was told). Unfortunately, there was no MRI facility in the JPP, and at that hour there wasn't really anyone to ask. I found an information kiosk that showed a MRI lab in the Centennial Pavilion, so I hurried down there and took a seat in the waiting room.
Of course, there wasn't anyone in the reception booth so I just sat in t...

My mom, being a constant worrier, implored me, for her sake, to get someone to help clean my apartment so it would be clean and I wouldn't have to worry about getting sick at home.

Six days later I was in the ICU at St. Paul's with a 104 degree F fever, and my left lung had partially collapsed due to pneumonia.

                I've posted a few times on this subject, but this is a new paper that's hot off the presses. Once thought to help with weight loss, caffeine has recently been cast in a new light as actually contributing to weight gain. Even caffeinated diet pop can lead to weight gain, due to increased insulin secretion in the body.

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study with periods of 7 days and washouts of 5 days comparing caffeine with placebo capsules was conducted. Participants we...

They were forced to dilate my eyes, which means not only am I totally sensitive to light right now, but I'm having a very hard time reading anything.

                This morning I went downstairs and checked the mail, and was surprised to see a bill from the ministry of health. It would seem that the government wants me to pay for the ambulance that took me to the hospital the night I ended up with multiple lacerations to my head and face, and five broken bone segments in my face. While I'm obviously appreciative for our medical system, considering I have had two surgeries now that I haven't had to pay for, given that our health care system is supposed to b...

                A few blog posts ago, I mentioned that I was going to do my best to return back to my pre-last-relationship weight. To that end, I have spent the last week hitting the gym from time to time and attempting to watch what I eat. The first week has been a bit rocky, and I hit a few tasty speed bumps at Rebecca's Cinqo de Mayo party, but for the most part I've been on track.

                If you would have mentioned that you were trying to lose weight by a reducing your carbohydrate intake a few years ago, people would have dismissed you as crazy and told you that you were only hurting your body. However, that all changed sometime around 2003 when a prestigious medical school released a peer-reviewed study that basically showed Low Carbohyrate diets not only help people lose more weight, but also result in better blood-lipid profiles than their low-fat counterparts.
