                    Yesterday I went down to Friday Harbor and hung out with my friend Lynn. I hadn't been to Friday Harbor since I was about 17 or so, so it was definitely cool to go back. There wasn't as much there to do as I thought there would be, but Lynn and I managed to find a few watering holes to hang out in and observe the locals for a while. "Chap-man" pretty much took the weirdo cake, but there were lots of runners up. It was great catching up with Lynn again too, since we hadn't had a chance to hang out for over two years now. In addition, the weather was nearly perfect, and reminded me of a nice warm ...

                    First, I gotta say, I'm all over this little pub at Cultus Lake. I first came up here with Rebecca and John on the weekend, but it not only has one of the nicest patios I've been on in a while, but a pretty decent selection of food and drinks as well. I'm fairly certain they're all gonna know me by name here pretty soon.
This weekend I'm meeting my friend Lynn down in Anacortes, WA, and we're going to take the little ferry over to Friday Harbor for the day. I actually was there a very long time ago (it was a field trip back in high school for some of us), and I remember it being fairly cool, especially ...
