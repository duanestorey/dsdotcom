My friend Raymi in Toronto has a very unique, and often copied, blog. So tonight, after getting a bit tipsy, I attempted to recreate some of her brilliance myself.

The end result is a funny parody, complete with drunk dancing by myself. You can check it out at duanetheminx.com.

                    So it's not very often something can make me bust out loud laughing, but this did the trick. I'm a closet Star Trek nerd, and used to sit around and watch episodes with my dad growing up. One of my favorites is when Kirk takes sand and rocks and shit and blows up that Godzilla looking guy on that weird planet. He's that good.
I found this photo on Christie's facebook page, and she told me it was cool to blog it. This thing still cracks me up every time I see it.

                    So last night I headed down to the Alibi room for Keri's 29th birthday party. I got the official invite via a myspace bulletin a while ago, and slotted it into my calender. The piece I apparently forgot I guess was the "RSVP via Email" thing at the bottom. So tonight, I got all dolled up, and headed down there for 10pm. Only problem was nobody else was there.. So, I got myself a drink, and waited. After an hour I realized there were a few holes in my original plan.. Unfortunatley, my cell phone was recently fixed, and I don't have many numbers in there yet, so I had no way to contact any of the ...
