                I've been spending a bit of time talking to Dale recently about life, careers, and where we both want to end up in the next few years. During one of our recent iChats, I was reminded of this Mexican Fisherman Story I heard a few years ago and managed to track it down. After I showed it to Dale he suggested I post it up here, because it has a fairly important message in it.

An American tourist was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.

                Some random thoughts of mine from a coffee shop.

Thou shalt know thy order before approaching the counter
Thou shalt not hog the cream station for extended periods of time
Thou shalt wipe up thy coffee mess after a spill
Thou shalt not prefix thy coffee order with more than three descriptive words
Thou shalt not setup a laptop on a table for six when drinking alone
Thou shalt not order any item that cannot be reliably pronounced
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's coffee barista
Thou shalt not ...

                I was catching up on Tony's site tonight and stumbled across this photo of Tony from 2006. Apparently he ended up on Hot Chicks With Douche Bags back then, which I think is awesome.

Tony spends his days injecting massive amounts of awesome into the LA Times as the head of their 40-some odd blogs, and his nights attending cool music and social events in Los Angeles, so I think it's pretty funny he'd end up there. But hey, getting your photo taken with a cute girl is always a good thing.

                So, this in this day and age this is probably a rhetorical post. I imagine most guys wear boxer shorts these days, and I typically do as well. That being said, I couldn't find any that were clean this morning so I was forced to put on a pair of briefs that were hiding in my closet.
Surprisingly, they are far comfier than I remembered. It sort of feels like I've just reunited with an old childhood friend. Even though that friend is going to go away as soon as the laundry machine spins back up, it...

                I actually hit the sack before midnight last night, which is pretty much an unprecedented event in my life. The main reason was because I had to get up early and take my car into the shop to get some TLC.
While on my road trip a few weeks ago, a few things suddenly stopped working, including the door lock switch on the driver's side door, the CD player (it currently does a better job grinding CDs then it does playing them), and a small problem with my gear shifter. In addition, my car is about o...

                So, this is a fairly basic question. Lately, some people have been installing little rick roll blockers, thinking that it somehow protects them from being rick rolled simply because the video no longer plays. My take on that is that it's basically a form of cheating, and that if you clicked the link, you were rick rolled.
But let's see what my knowledgeable readers have to say. Chime in below:

Starbucks has just been ordered to pay $100 million worth of cash that was taken out of their employees' tip jars and given to managers and shift supervisors. It always boggles my mind how establishments like that routinely try and screw their employees, many of which are making minimum wage.
