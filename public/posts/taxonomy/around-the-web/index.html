                As you can see, my little advertising experiment with Commission Junction is pretty failtastic.

Which is strange, because the ads are fairly targeted based on a few specific, popular pages of mine. I'm not a big fan of advertising to tell you the truth -- I ripped Google Adsense off here a few months ago. To me, it's worth $10 a month or whatever not to have them pollute my main page. I was testing a new concept though with more targeted ads that I choose, but so far it's not working.

Mom: "Hey, you know that blog entry about people getting to your blog by googling duanestorey.com" Me: "Yah" Mom: "Don't tell anyone, but it was us.. That's what we do"

Lately I've begun submitting the odd story on my own to Digg. No matter how many times I try to submit something though, I always seem to get stuck on the same old problem -- what category does the story fit in? The main problem I think is that Digg categories are more mainstream ne...

I'm collecting data in real time right now, so it will be interesting to see what it'll all look like after a few days.

                Hey guys. I want to do a fairly simple web experiment this week. I want to try to assess real-world uptime and latency for a bunch of popular hosting sites. I need a bunch of volunteers to help out. Basically all I'll need you to do is upload a file to your root directory and allow me to ping it from time to time to do some measurements. I'll tabulate the data next week and put it online for everyone to see.
So, if you can help out, drop me a comment and let me know:

My little project for the evening was to try and media-ify my blog somehow. One of the ideas I was playing with was extracting all the media out of all my blog posts and having that in a separate player somewhere. There are other players for Wordpress (based on the popular flash FLV player) that do something similar, except with those you have to manually input a playlist or set up...

Shared hosting is a fairly cheap way to set up a website, and you can usually get away with it for less than $10/mo. For the most part, I was pretty happy with HostMonster shared hosting, although in these last few months their databases kept falling over, and I had intermittent co...

There's already one on Facebook that mimics the old version (although, it's basically a wrapper for a website that already has it), but I have some ideas that will sort of bring the game into the modern age, including a mobile component.

                As I was browsing the internet tonight and accidentally ran into a photo of mine on a website. So, while I was there, I figured I might as well see where else some of my photos have ended up.

Chris Blackburn used one of my HDR shots in a blog posting
A shot of Boris used in a blog entry
My HDR shot of Kitsilano used on the Kitsilano.ca website

As I was tracking these down in Google, I realized how nice a f...

                Even though I spent quite a bit of time working on my last theme, I've grown rather tired of it. So, after checking out some themes on the net tonight, I found this one which I rather like. I think I'm going to modify it a bit and put up a new version for people to download....

                If you accessed my website at all today, you would witnessed one of the slowest websites to ever grace the series of tubes that we call the internet. I spent about two hours on the phone today with web hosting company GoDaddy.com trying to convince them that it was their problem. Unfortunately, even after escalating it multiple times, they still told me it was my fault.
So about an hour ago I decided that I had had enough of GoDaddy. I cancelled my hosting, acquired new hosting via HostMonster, ...

                I finally cleaned up the main plugin for this website enough that I'm ready to release it to whoever wants to test it out. You can read about it and download it from the Crossroads Page. Basically all the flickr pieces on this website are handled by that plugin, so if you like what you see on this website, then feel free to test it on yours.
I still have a ton of work to do on it, mainly in the speed optimization area, but I figured it's good enough now for some people to test out. Enjoy....
