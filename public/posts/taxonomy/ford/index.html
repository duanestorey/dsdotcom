                    I just read this article which talks about how the executives at Ford are willing to cut their salaries to $1 if they receive money from the federal government. Wow, that's nice of them.
Notably absent in that entire article is a mention of executive bonuses. Bonuses and dividends are typically taxed as investments instead of income, and usually result in a smaller tax burden. In Canada, the tax rate on dividends is roughly half of what it is in regular income, so that's the preferred method of making money.
So if they reduce their salaries to $1, I gotta ask, what are they planning to do with ...

How do you feel about that? I read this article with the CEO of Ford today, where the interviewer basically pummeled him. When asked about Ford's strategy with regards to electric cars, the CEO had this to say:

We are working on that [fully electric cars], but let me just share with you the Ford plan about that. Our No. 1 priority is to improve the internal combustion engine, and that's why the turbocharging, the direct fuel injection, we get a 20 percent improvement in fuel mileage and a 15 percent reduction in CO2, but we get that across all of the engines, across all the vehicles.
