                    In August I decided to finally upgrade my Olympus E-PL2 micro four thirds camera (henceforth referred to as u4/3). While that camera had served me well for a few years, there was still something that really bothered me about its performance, and that was how it handled low light.
If you have no idea what a u4/3 camera is, then read on. Basically a few years ago some of the major camera manufacturers decided to come together and agree on a specification for a camera system that would have interchangeable lenses. Why this is important is that with the u4/3 system you can buy the camera body from ...

                    As of yesterday, I am no longer the owner of a SLR camera. I purchased my first SLR back in 2004, so I've been a SLR user for almost 7 years. And while I love the quality of photos you can take with a SLR camera, dragging tons of equipment and lenses around gets a bit tiring. That's even more true when you start picking up some of the nicer, heavier lenses, many of which I owned previously.
I sold all my L-series glass about 6 months ago, partially because they weren't being used and also because I needed the cash to finance some of my current traveling adventures. I wasn't originally going to ...

                    I'm in the process of checking myself out of my apartment in Buenos Aires, and will be shortly heading to New York City for a few days of feasting and sight-seeing. One of the first items on the agenda though is to head to B&amp;H camera to pick up my first micro four-thirds system camera.

I've decided on the Olympus E-PL2 camera, which is one of the newest, highly reviewed micro four-thirds bodies available. John Biehler just did a great write-up on the same camera, so definitely check it out.
While John used the 17mm lens, I'll probably be buying the 20mm f/1.7 lens, simply because it's a bit ...

                    I've been blogging about buying a new camera for quite some time now, and I'm pretty sure I have it narrowed down. Unfortunately, buying a camera at this point is a compromise for me, and I have a hard time making compromises in the technology sphere.
SLR cameras and lenses are heavy. They are hard to carry, hard to pack, and a pain to take from place to place. But if you want high-end image quality, than a SLR offers you the best of the best. I love my SLR, but my Canon 40D SLR is in need of replacement at this point. I sold most of my lenses last year, so I don't really have any professional ...
