                    Last night, a few of us gathered down at Ben's house near the Crosstown area for a small housewarming party. Ben is a good friend of mine from the old UBC days, and he's pretty close to being a full-fledged doctor now. Afterwards, a small group of us briefly ended up at Honey for a round of booty-shaking.
Me and Joe, @ Honey Lounge
I also got to meet a few new people through Ben, which is always something I rather enjoy. Here's a shot of Delilah (from Toronto) and her Vancouver friend Kate. Delilah has offered to show me around a bit when I'm in Toronto in August, and I'm quite looking forward ...

                    Well, it's now official -- not only am I officially 30, but I have also survived my 30th birthday party. Thanks to everyone who came out to enjoy a few beers. In my case, thanks to all the shots, I drank way more than I'm used to. While I had a great time, unfortunately I slipped down the stairs at Honey and lost my glasses long enough for a few people to step on them.

Thanks everyone who popped by.
