                I'm nearly packed for my trip. Truthfully, I'm looking forward to getting away this weekend and relaxing a bit. The main reason I'm going is because Dave and Lauren are getting married on Saturday.

That said, I'm hoping to meet up with a friend tomorrow night and maybe go catch a movie or go bowling or something. My friend Lynn is also coming along to the wedding on Saturday, which should be a lot of fun.
The wedding is in a really cool location called the Herban Feast near Sodo Park. It looks ...

                Hard to believe I'll be getting on a plane in 10 days and heading on vacation for two weeks. Truthfully, I'm really looking forward to relaxing by the pool with a few books. Reading is something I get a lot of enjoyment out of, but for whatever reason I go through big periods where I don't really read all that much. So I'm hoping to hit a Chapters store before I leave and grab a pile of books.
Like most vacations, I'm debating whether or not to bring my digital SLR. Truthfully, I think I'm going...

                How's that for a title? It'll pretty much sum my day up when it's all over.
For whatever reason, I've been super tired lately. Despite getting a fairly normal amount of sleep during the week, I've hit the last few weekends completely exhausted. Yesterday, for example, I spent a few hours sleeping on the couch by the fire. Upon waking up in the early evening, I watched a few movies, and then went straight to bed, sleeping in until around 10am (after the time change). It definitely feels great, bu...

                Almost time to get in a plane. Tomorrow night I'll pack everything up and get ready for a trip down to the states on Friday. Definitely looking forward to the weekend, and also being on the other side of it since it's the last real event of the summer before I can downshift a few gears and take things a bit slower again.

I probably won't post again until WordCamp, but who knows....

                So yesterday I was sitting on my patio trying to figure out when to take a vacation. I still have a few small client-related items to finish off, so I've been waiting around for that. While going over everything in my head though I remembered that because I work from a laptop, there's really no reason why I can't work remotely. All I need is an internet connection once and a while to check email, and I'm basically golden.

With that in mind, I'm thinking about testing my Nexus pass out in the ne...

                Turns out that my friend Lynn down in Seattle has had a blog for years and years, but for some reason I never knew about it until recently. It's actually a really good read, with quite a few personal entries as well. So if you're looking for some new reading material, definitely head on over and check it out. She'll probably kill me for posting this, but I like living dangerously, so.
Lynn was nice enough to send me some fruit flowers for my birthday years ago, and even though I'm not in Seattle...

                Part of the reason I drove to Seattle last weekend was that I was really anxious to try out Virgin America's relatively new airline. They have already garnered a reputation for being fun and innovative, much the same way Canada's West Jet is viewed by locals. Their planes are all new Airbus models, they have funky mood-lighting, and also plugs between all the seats so you can use your laptop during the entire flight. I even went so far as to email their media contact email address, and received ...

                To say that yesterday was a rather crappy day would be an understatement. For several weeks now I've been planning on attending WordCamp in San Francisco. Since I'm paying for the trip out of my own pocket, I decided to try and be a bit more financially conscious than I usually am on trips. So I decided I would fly out of Seattle instead of Vancouver, which as it turns out was around $300 cheaper.
I was actually looking forward to the drive, and burned myself a few CDs. I went into work for a fe...

While I'm pretty excited to go down and meet a lot of new bloggers and WordPress enthusiasts, I can't say I'm looking forward to driving to Seattle tomorrow for my flight. For whatever reason, flying from Canada is super expensive these days, and I'm saving about $300 just by flying out of Seattle. I'm going to b...

We'll be heading down to the Tractor Tavern in about 90 minutes to catch the show. I'm charging the camera now, so hopefully I'll grab a few shots.
Also, just checked the official website. The only musician to have a sell-out at the Tractor Travern this month:

                I had a really good time in Seattle last night. On my way back from my big walking adventure, I saw a pub called "The Blarney Stone" and basically had to stop by to have one drink out of honour of my home town. While sitting at the pub, I tried my first (and probably last) Strongbow beer. If you haven't had one, you definitely should at least once.. It sort of tastes like apple juice on steroids.
It was here that I ran into Sara and Alec and started my drinking adventure of the evening. I had ma...
