                    Arieanna and I spent this afternoon walking around the festivities. Today is basically the warm up for tomorrow, so it was rather relaxed. We spent time bouncing between beer gardens and the second stage, the latter of which had various talent performing throughout the day.
Ianiv took the ferry this afternoon, and will be getting here shortly. Arieanna and I sweet-talked our way onto the fireworks barge later, so we'll have press access for that as well. I haven't really taken photos since the Junos, so today was a good warm up day for me. Here are a few shots I took:

                    Just a quick post. I met up with Arieanna this morning at the helicopter pad for our trip to Victoria. The helicopter was a lot of fun, and surprisingly smooth. We picked up our media passes a while ago, and are about to go get some fish and chips somewhere. Look for more shots later.

                    I went for a walk this afternoon down to the mall to buy a few new shirts. When I got there, I fielded a SMS message from John Biehler saying he was heading to the Apple store and asked if I wanted to meet up. I met him and Peter there, after which time we all headed down to the new Crumpler store on the edge of Gastown.
I've always wanted a Crumpler bag, but they were hard to come by in Vancouver. So today I picked up a new camera bag with the intention of taking it to Victoria tomorrow. Here's what it looks like:

I opted for the smaller of the two bags they had, and I'm already regretting it. ...

The other day Arieanna contacted me via Twitter and asked if I wanted a photo pass for the festivities this weekend in Victoria. Since I haven't been to Victoria in a few years, I thought it might be a good opportunity to sample some island beer and take some photos.

Sometimes photo passes just let you get your camera in the door, and aren't really anything special. However, Arieanna just got confirmation that our passes include access to the front-stage ...

                    Most compact cameras that you pick up from Future Shop only have one built in lens. In most cases, it's a zoom lens, capable of giving you moderate wideangle coverage upwards to a decent telephoto lens. Most people probably don't know the difference between those two, so I thought I'll give a brief tutorial.
The most well known lens is probably the 50mm prime. 50mm refers to the focal length of the lens, and prime refers to the fact that it's a fixed focal length lens (i.e. not a zoom lens). In photography, the 50mm lens is also called a "standard" lens because it almost exactly matches the field ...

                    Based on a suggestion by Raul, I'm going to talk a little bit about my entry into photography. I originally got into a photography because I wanted a hobby that exploited my creative side without all the trappings of the math and science I typically deal with in my day job. Photography to me has always been a bit of a release, a way to unwind and simply see only a small portion of the world at a time. It's like turning the power off and noticing your ears are ringing -- it represents a way for me to unplug from the world for a period of time.

Kevin Haggerty

Thanks for your support. If anyone else pledges before my next entry, drop a comment or an email and I'll make sure I add your name. I don't have the exact number, but I think that brings us close to $300, with a goal of $1000. So if you can help us hit that goal, please head on over to the pledge page and lend some support.
To sweeten the deal, I'll give any person who donates $50 or more to the Union Gospel Mission an 8x12 photo of your choosing from my HDR gallery located at SmugMug.

A New Day Begins In Vancouver
I took this photo at around 5am this morning. Watching the sun rise or the sun set is something I will never tire of. Seeing the orange-red glow stretch across the horizon always makes me think what a beautiful thing it is to be alive, and what an amazing part of the world I live in.

There are some people who think sunsets are cliche, and that taking photos of them is a waste of time. But I think the complete opposite, and as long as I have a camera, there will always be a sunset or a sunrise worth taking a photo of.

A New Day Begins In Vancouver
I took this photo at around 5am this morning. Watching the sun rise or the sun set is something I will never tire of. Seeing the orange-red glow stretch across the horizon always makes me think what a beautiful thing it is to be alive, and what an amazing part of the world I live in.

There are some people who think sunsets are cliche, and that taking photos of them is a waste of time. But I think the complete opposite, and as long as I have a camera, there will always be a sunset or a sunrise worth taking a photo of.

                    As most of you know, I really enjoy photography. I have been fortunate enough to have received a bit of recognition for some of the shots I've done, and even managed to attend the 2008 Canadian Juno Awards as a photographer.
I thought I'd post a few of my favourite shots here for those that are new here.





Most of these shots make use of a technique called high dynamic range (HDR) photography.

                    In October 2003, there was a massive release of energy from our sun. The resulting coronal mass ejection (CME) headed straight for our planet, bombarding it with a massive amount of charged particles. The official classification for the flare was an X17.2, which is one of the top three recorded solar flares in the history of our planet.

The charged particles disrupted satellite communications in space, and also lead to auroras being seen as far south as the Chicago. I was fortunate enough to be following the activity while it was happening, and was notified via email (via SpaceWeather.com) ...

                    Tonight was a jam packed night. I left work around 7pm, and then headed down Granville Street, frantically looking for something to eat. I actually walked into Wings, but it was completely full. So eventually I settled on my old-faithful nacho-haven, the Two Parrots. They had a 35 cent wing special on, so I filled up with that.

Eventually I ended up at some Spanish place (coincidentally, it's only one block from my place, and I had never been there) to celebrate Raul's graduation from UBC with his Ph.D. (congrats dude, well, deserved). Good times.
As some of you know, this weekend is New Music ...
