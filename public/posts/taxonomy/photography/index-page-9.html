Truth is, I love taking photos. I love the challenge associated with finding a subject, figuring out how to best represent that subject, framing the subject, and then ultimately spending time on my computer later re-factoring the shot or enhancing ...

                    I have a wedding to shoot in a few short months, so I've been asking friends if they'd let me shoot them to get some practice. Today I met up with John, Keira and Rebecca for a quick photo walk in the park. To be honest, after doing this shoot, I think I feel comfortable shooting outside now. I sort of always assumed my 70-200mm f/2.8L lens would be pretty useless in poor lighting or in a wedding environment, but when I used it today with my speedlight, it was actually pretty awesome. Every time I pull that lens out of my bag and put it on (which isn't often enough I've decided), I'm completely ...

                    I got my first roll back of Ilford XP2 back from development. My overall impression of it is pretty good - the grain is pretty light for ISO 400 (at least my memory of what ISO 400 was). It's not as contrasty as I normally like, and I bumped the contrast up slightly before posting them, but it's not that bad. The dynamic range is pretty decent, and the only shots that it struggled with were taken outside in the sun. All in all, I'm impressed enough that I'll give it another go.
Kris Krug snapped a few of these, so check out the actual flickr site for more info. ...

                    Today after work I dropped off my first roll of film to be developed. It was a 36 shot roll of Ilford XP2, and it's probably the only black and white roll I've ever shot in my entire life, now that I think about it. The neat thing about this roll is that you can develop it in C41 chemistry (used for colour print film), which means you can basically get it developed anywhere in the city for next to nothing. I also have a few rolls of pure black and white to shoot, so I think it will be a useful comparison. I asked the ladies down at Custom Colour if the XP2 was noticeably different than the pure ...

                    Tonight I did something that I've been thinking of doing for a few weeks now -- I picked up a film SLR body so that I could once again shoot film. And to even write that statement down now seems a bit weird, since I left the world of film years ago, thinking I would never ever shoot a roll of film again in my life.

However, a lot of friends of mine who are into photography have started dabbling once again in the forbidden art, and it has caused me to take it seriously once again. I have no idea if it will last long with me, but it's definitely cool enough to keep me entertained for a few months ...

For the most part, most of those cameras were nothing more than glorified webcams -- they took grainy photos, and really didn't have any options. However, one in particular stood out above the rest. It was the Nikon Coolpix 880, and it became my first digital camera.

Chris Blackburn used one of my HDR shots in a blog posting
A shot of Boris used in a blog entry
My HDR shot of Kitsilano used on the Kitsilano.ca website
My aurora shots on the NASA website
A photo of Rebecca on her blog

                    So, I gotta hand it to my pal Kris -- he's managed to get me interested in something I never thought I'd be interested in again -- film photography. Kris is a really awesome fashion photographer here in Vancouver, and his stuff never ceases to amaze me.
What's interesting about Kris, and a variety of the local photographers I've met recently, is that they have started shooting film again. Which is sort of surprising, given the focus local photography shops seem to place on digital nowadays (I called several local stores recently to talk about film, and most of them didn't even have film cameras ...

I know I said I wouldn't post again until after my surgery, but I took a few shots tonight, and liked this one the most. So enjoy.
The countdown is officially on -- I had that exciting call with the nurse today, and got the green light from Houston to go ahead with the launch. I find out tomorrow afternoon the exact time of my surgery, and will spend part of the day cleaning up and getting ready for it.
Take care of the internet for me for a few days while I'm gone. Talk to you soon guys. ...

                    A few days ago, Flickr gave me the not-so-subtle warning that my account was about to expire. Since I've had a pro-Flickr account for a full year now, I thought I'd take this opportunity to share my thoughts on the service so far.
Flickr sort of came to the limelight about 18-24 months ago as one of the leading websites that had real Web 2.0 technology. If you haven't been there you should definitely check it out. Most of the website utilizes Ajax and as you use it, sometimes it feels more like an application than a mere website, and that was really one of their original selling points.

                    On May 5th, Flickr is having a big world-wide event were everyone is being asked to record a day of their life in photos. I think this is a pretty cool idea, and it should make for some really interesting browsing when it's all over. Unfortunately for me, May 5th will probably involve mostly sleeping and chewing pain killers, but I'm definitely going to try and participate if I can. ...

                    I've been messing around a bit more with photoshop in the evenings, and one day soon I'll read the huge 1000 page book I have on it as well. Here's something I was messing with a bit last night. It's a shot from my patio looking easy towards Yaletown. The bridge is the Granville Street Bridge.

The whole image involved work on about 5 different layers in photoshop. The rain was a bit trickier than I imagined, and it's not entirely convincing, but it's a good start. ...
