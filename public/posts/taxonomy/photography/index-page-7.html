                The moon looked really cool tonight, so I popped on the longest zoom lens I have in the house, the 70-200mm f/2.8L, and fired a few shots off of my balcony.

I think it turned out not bad, considering I hand held it. If I had an extender I could probably do an even better job....

                So, I know there are a bunch of programs available on the Mac for doing photo work and what not, but I'd like to ask everyone what they use on a daily basis. I have for the most part made due with iPhoto, but the organization capabilities of it suck, and I end up with directories full of photos without any real means to identify them. Unfortunately, I also need something with a relatively quick workflow (photoshop is too slow to use for me except in extreme cases).
Any recommendations?...

                One of the main advantages of digital photography over film photography, at least in my mind, is the ability to view the histogram shortly after taking the shot. While viewing the image on the LCD is obviously an advantage as well, it's difficult to tell if the shot actually turned out based on a small image on a 2-3" LCD.

The day started at around 11am for me and Hesty. We suited up, did some last minute charging of equipment, and then got in touch with the groom. Normally the photographer heads over to the where the bride is getting ready for some photos, but Kim's aunt wanted to do those ones, so I was relieved of that duty.

                So, I called around this morning, and the first trickle of the Canon 40Ds are hitting stores. Unfortunately, Canon is behind on manufacturing them, and there are tons of pre-orders, so the average Joe won't be able to buy one for some time. I have my name on a wait list, and I'm pretty sure I'll get mine on Tuesday, should I still want it. But since today was payday, and I have money sitting aside for it, I think I'll probably get it....

                For those of you who are expecting free prints, rest assured they will be in the mail soon. I have most of them printed out already, and am just figuring out the best way to get them to you guys. I'll do my best not to miss anyone, but if you haven't received one by the end of next week, drop me a line and let me know....
