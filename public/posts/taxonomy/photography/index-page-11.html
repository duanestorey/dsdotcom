                    Canon has noticeably lagged in releasing new DSLRS, especially on the higher end versions. To their credit, they did a big upgrade to the Digital Rebel line earlier this year with the Rebel XTi. This is a great camera that improves on a few areas that the 20D/30D had, even though it's considered part of their consumer lineup. Some of the nicest changes in my mind for the XTi are:

The ability to view the ISO in the viewfinder. On the 20D, you have to hunt for it
Larger LCD screen over the 20D
Canon sensor cleaning system


I consider the last one very important. I'm very careful when I change ...

Last week I tossed and turned in my bed until nearly 6am, even though I went to bed sometime around midnight. It's like even though I'm really tired, the moment by head hits the mattress, all these involuntary thoughts start coursing through my brain. When it gets really bad, I usually take a melatonin, but those are pretty hit or miss with me. When they hit, they usually hit pretty hard, and I find myself pretty groggy in the morning.
So, it's 2:11am, and I'm back on the couch messing on the computer because I can't ...

Whenever it would happen, I would just stop using contractions in my head and write stuff out, but not only does that a) sound really dumb, but b) it also is really hard in some situations to remove the contractions completely without it sounding ...

I went out today and picked up a little Christmas present for myself - the Canon 430EX Speedlight. I've never really had a chance to get into flash photography, so I'm looking forward to messing around with it. The nice thing is that the internal flash on my 20D really sucks. For some reason they never included a focus assist lamp for low light conditions. Canon's way around this was the fire the internal flash several times in a row to try and do a focus in low light. However, this usually scares whoever you're trying to take a photo of, and causes all the epileptics in the room to go into synchronized ...

                    I just got back from quickly picking up my fixed Canon SD630 camera. Apparently the warp-core phase-inverter was out of alignment, so I had to get that readjusted to the tune of $160. Seriously, those guys can turn any small problem into a huge one that can cost lots of money. I was originally told the shutter door was broken, which seemed somewhat reasonable (I pictured a really small, weak hinge breaking). However, now it's more along the lines of the "shutter solenoid ring was hosed." How does a shutter solenoid ring break? Better question, what the hell is a shutter solenoid ring anyways? ...

                    Last night, I decided I was way too lazy to drag my butt from the couch into my bedroom, so I just grabbed a blanket and slept there. And let me tell you -- what a refreshing sleep. I sometimes forget just how comfy my couch really is. I woke up at like noon, with the sounds of birds chirping and the fresh air blowing through my apartment (ok, maybe no birds were chirping, but you get the idea). I decided that it was a really good day to go for a walk, and what better destination than to head to Kits to see Dustin and Dori.
I grabbed my iPod and my camera and walked down to the little ferry to ...

                    So there's this buzz amongst photographers about this new technique called HDR (high dynamic range). The basic idea is that a camera isn't capable of capturing nearly as much dynamic range as what our eyes can capture.? With HDR, you take multiple shots of the same scene using a digital camera on a tripod, and create a new photograph using the information from all the shots. That new image contains a much larger dynamic range than would be possible using any one shot.
Here are some cool examples from flickr.




I bought a new tripod and a remote shutter release for my 20D this weekend, so I might ...

                    First off -- I hate my tripod.. I'm going to get a new one, just because it's nearly impossible to figure out if mine is level. Anyways, I'm one of those somewhat stubborn people in life. I can be reasoned with, but if I'm in the wrong mood, it's hard to change my mind about some things.. I'd rather do some weird acrobatic maneuver with a pool cue than admit defeat and use the granny. So when it comes to photography, I can probably count the number of times I've used a tripod in my life on one hand. That being said, I read once that the difference between a good photo and a great photo is a tripod. ...

                    First off, I met with my supervisor tonight to finalize my thesis.. Although I don't have an official answer yet, it's very likely I'll be giving my defense next Thursday.. That's really soon, and I have a lot of work to do before then, but the good news is then I'm completely done before I go on vacation, which would be pretty awesome.. There will definitely be booze 'a flowin 'a plenty Thursday night if I pull it off. On Friday I'm going to Cirque de Soleil, so I hope that my defense is Thursday so I can go out and get sloshed.
On another note, I found the best way ever to make shitty coffee, ...

                    I was just reading that Sony has finally come out with a digital SLR of their own. At first I kind of scoffed at it, thinking that nobody really uses Sony these days (seems like everywhere I go someone has a Canon or Nikon SLR). However, reading the specs, it seems pretty impressive. I like the idea of putting the image stabilization in the camera body instead of on the lens. Canon charges quite a bit for the IS versions of several of its lenses, so it's nice to know that Sony is a little smarter in this area. I'm not sure what the price point is for this new SLR, but it might be fun to check ...
