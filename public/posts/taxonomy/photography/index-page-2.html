                    Canon has just announced a brand new EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS lens - the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II. This is one of Canon's most popular L-series lenses, and is pretty much a must-have for most serious wedding and event photographers. I have the non-IS (image stabilized) version, which works fairly well in most scenarios, but I've heard the IS version allows you to hand-hold shots in scenarios where the non-IS version would fail.
Here's some information on it:

Canon has improved the optical performance by redesigning the internal elements, incorporating a fluorite element and a fifth UD element to help ...

                    A long time ago I wrote that I had started to try and turn the Crossroads Flickr plugin into a full-featured stock photography plugin. Unfortunately, I haven't had much time to work on it in the last six months, but finally sat down last night to start to hack on it a bit more. I'm thankful to say that I've finally put most of the pieces together such that I now have a full featured stock photography section on my website powered almost exclusively by Flickr. If you'd like to browse around, I suggest you head over to Leslie Feist gallery and start there.

                    Without a doubt, shooting in low-light conditions is one of the most challenging aspects of taking photographs. I would still probably rate weddings a bit more challenging (since most weddings include some elements of low-light in addition to outdoor shots), but it's definitely near the top of my difficulty scale.
With the advent of digital cameras, most SLR bodies now have the ability to allow the user to arbitrarily increase the ISO setting on the camera in order to improve the low-light responsiveness. So obviously when a photographer encounters a low-light situation, he or she can simply increase ...

                    Without a doubt, one of my favorite events to shoot is a sunset. I used to live a stone's throw away from the Pacific Ocean, and walking down and watching the sun set was pretty much a weekly or a semi-weekly event during the summers. I know that many photographers think that sunset photos are a bit cliche, but I've never thought so. To me, watching the sun set highlights some of the real beauty of this world, and reminds me of all the great things that bring me joy in it.
So, here are a few of my favorite sunset photos that I've taken over the years:

                    One of the hobbies I have that brings me a lot of enjoyment is photography. It's something I've slowly honed and improved over the years to the point where I'm fairly comfortable with my camera, and with taking photos in most situations. Given how much enjoyment it's been to me, I thought I would periodically do the odd photo-entry for blogathon and talk a bit about the photos I share.

This shot of Kitsilano beach is one of the shots I'm most known for. It's currently used on the Kitsilano.ca website, and also in a few brochures. I was actually just randomly driving back from UBC one night, heading ...

                    I did a photoshoot the other day for a few friends of mine. The shoot was in a big field, at around 4pm in the afternoon. There was lots of light obviously, since it was a sunny day, but the sun was high in the sky and the shadows were pretty harsh.
For the most part, I always take a flash outdoors with me now. A long time ago using a flash outside would have seemed silly, but I've photographed a few weddings now, and understand that fill flash is required in many outdoor situations to help balance the ambient light. So for this shoot, I brought along my speedlight.
While the photos turned out ...

I've been watching my traffic, and so far I've consistently about double the traffic (actually, a tad bit more) since launching. I'm sure part of that is a transient contribution from launching a new site and Twittering about it, but I'm fairly certain the traffic will definitely go up, since there's now a lot more to do here now (specifically in the photography section).

Tonight some of my old friends came for a visit, and we went down to the little park near where we grew up to take a few family photos. Unfortunately the weather wasn't really cooperating, and we got rained on a little bit.
One of the biggest challenges for taking family photos is working with children. Children are obviously full of energy, and taking photos isn't always something they like to do, especially when there are swing sets and ducks waddling around. Thankfully Kaede was happy to accommodate a few photos in between duck feeding sessions.
Since Kaede is about to be a big sister, we ...

                    I put together a Facebook photography page a while ago. If you use Facebook, and like some of the photos I've taken, then please become a fan of this page. I'm going to be redoing my personal website shortly to be more photo centric and mostly reflect my online photography as opposed to some of my writings. ...

                    About 18 months ago a few people encouraged me to put some of my photos online for sale. Given that my Vancouver scenery ones are the most popular photos in my portfolio, I've pretty much only focused on that. I've actually made a decent amount by selling them, probably enough to be able to afford a cheap lens, which is pretty cool.
The next item on my wish list is the Canon EOS 5D Mark II camera, which is one of the most affordable full frame cameras on the market. Unfortunately, the list price of that camera is around $3200, so it's a bit outside of my price range at this point. So, I'm going ...

                    I'm going to overhaul this website again, most likely starting in July. To be perfectly honest, writing content just isn't as satisfying as it once was, partially because I don't have as much to write these days, and partially because I am just enjoying other aspects of my life more (such as going outside to hit some tennis balls around or heading up to the lake for lunch). Something I've always wanted on this blog, and that I've never really been able to achieve, is to have something that's predominantly photo-centric. So my goal in July will be transform this blog into something more photo oriented, ...
