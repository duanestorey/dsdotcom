                    I haven't really had much to say on here in a while. Other than maybe a camping trip this weekend, and WordCamp San Francisco at the end of the month, the next six weeks or so are pretty booked up solid with some client projects. After that I'm going to take a bit of a break for the summer and do some camping or maybe even head over to Europe to visit some friends.
So on that note, I'm going to take a break from traditional blog posts and do a week or so worth of photo entries. Comment if you like, don't comment if you like :) But enjoy!

                    Just a quick question to the photography crowd out there. Does anyone have any experience selling photos on microstock websites? A couple of people have asked me if I've ever put any photographs on microstock sites. I haven't, mainly because I feel pretty strange selling photos for 50 cents each. Truthfully though, most of my photos sit there collecting dust anyways and don't make any money, so I was just curious if there's enough volume on those sites to turn over any non-trivial cash-flow.
Drop a comment if you have any idea. Thanks. ...

                    My walls in my new place are still pretty bare, and that's something I've been trying to fix lately. I went down to Ikea a few weeks ago a bought a pile of frames, but unfortunately finding anything to put in them has proved to be fairly difficult.
The first problem is that I don't really have great photo backups of shots I've taken. If I were smart, I would have been uploading everything to Flickr at full resolution so I could use that as my archive. Unfortunately, I haven't done that, so most of my photo originals are scattered amongst various DVDs and directories. I've always found iPhoto and ...

                    A few years ago I sat down to write my very first WordPress plugin, and ended up writing Crossroads. My goal at the time was to integrate Flickr comments into the normal comments on my blog, which was something I ultimately did. Unfortunately though, some of the limitations of the Flickr API made that feature fairly slow to use, and so it's something I ditched on my own blog a long time ago.
A few days ago I sat down and started working on version 2.0. It's a 100% complete rewrite, which given the state of the old code is definitely something that's going to improve it. I'm writing it with both ...

I did something similar in Feburary of this year for Northern Voice, and I thought it would be a good idea to try again. Given that Barack Obama was one of the first presidential candidates to embrace social media, I thought I'd do a celebratory mosaic using a public photos posted to Flickr.

The image is constructed using Flickr photos from everyday, normal people, the same people who helped Obama and his grass-roots campaign to secure the presidency. The search tags used on Flickr were "obama election victory" and "obama celebration". The result is a mosiac using 1600 images.
Enjoy. If you'd ...

                    One of the areas of my website that I lost with the last theme change was my photography section. To be honest, it wasn't that complete before, but since photography is such a big part of my life, I miss having it around.
Tonight I sat in front of the TV and put together a new one. I extended some recent code I had written for SmugMug to pull in my photos from there. I'm going to slowly add some of my photos that I think might interest organizations looking for Vancouver photos, or various photography from some of the concerts I've attended.
So, feel free to head on over and check out the new ...

                    As I alluded to in my previous post today, I'm definitely looking at getting into video sometime in the near future. Considering I ordered a camera shortly after writing that post, "near future" is actually more like "early next week". I spent a solid twenty minutes or so trying to figure out what type of camera I wanted to purchase, and eventually narrowed it down to a few different ones.
In terms of features, I've always wanted a camera that could do 24P. Most consumer cameras shoot at 30 frames per second in an interlaced format, which is quite different than how film is shot. Most big budget ...

                    I've been saving some money for that last little while, fully expecting to make two purchases in the not too distant future. One of the first items will be a full frame camera body. I was forced to make a purchase of the 40D last year simply because I didn't trust my current camera enough to shoot a friend's wedding, but truthfully really wanted to get a full-frame instead. Canon's only affordable (at least to me) full frame is the Canon EOS 5D, but unfortunately it's about 3 years old now and doesn't have a lot of the new bells and whistles in it. Canon has been basically silent on the replacement ...

                    For those of you who follow my Flickr and my blog, you'll remember a few weeks ago I encountered some of my photos being used commercially on the Internet without my permission. For a while there it looked like the only recourse was going to be through legal channels, but after meeting with everyone today at a coffee shop, I'm happy to say we've all agreed on an arrangement that should work out.
I spend a lot of time trying to make sure rights of photographers are respected, and even went so far to do a podcast with the guys at Creative Commons last year. So I'm obviously glad that this issue ...

                    It should come as no surprise that photoshop is a much better tool that iPhoto. iPhoto is a free package that ships with Tiger and Leopard, and allows you to do quick adjustments to your photos. While obviously not marketed towards a high-end market, it's easy to use and is a fairly decent tool to have a in your photography arsenal.
Unfortunately, sometime around Leopard, my iPhoto experience seemed to get a lot worse. I never really figured out exactly what happened, but there was a clean point in time where I felt iPhoto started really underperforming.

                    This morning we woke up at 6am in order to catch the 8am ferry back to Vancouver. I don't think my head hit the pillow until around 1am, so needless to say I was pretty exhausted this morning. I've been trying to watch my caffeine intake over the last few weeks, and I definitely had a bunch this weekend. So even though I'm really beat today, I'm trying hard to not have any more caffeine.
In terms of the concert, it was easily one of the best events I've been to in a very long time. We spent most of yesterday bouncing between watching concerts, walking around in the sun, and sampling beer in the ...

                    Blog traffic is pretty low, even by weekend standards. So I can only assume that everyone's out enjoying the long weekend. I'll keep this post short for now.
We all had a rather crappy sleep last night, so we're a bit tired. We went down to the main stage early in the morning and managed to catch a few artists doing sound check. Here's a quick shot of Sarah McLachlan.

Here's a quick video I took of sound check. It's not finished converting yet, but head over and take a look. ...
