                    I accidentally stumbled onto my own feed in Google reader today and noticed some photos I actually didn't take. For whatever reasons, it seems like feed burner is not filtering the content based on my user account at Flickr, but instead is including public photos tagged "feedburner", something it never used to do.
I checked my settings, and it's definitely setup to only include photos from my stream, so the problem seems to be on their end. I tried finding a contact email on their site, but all they do is push you to the support forums (I hate this practice by companies nowadays -- support your ...

                    So tonight I was trying to figure out just how in the world I was going to go about merging multiple RSS feeds together. The end result I was trying to achieve was so my RSS feed on this site would actually have my entries from duanestorey.com as well as those from matthewgood.org. I sort of assumed that feedburner would do that for me, but it turns out you can't combine your own RSS feeds using it.
The solution? Yahoo Pipes. I had never heard of it, but after doing a quick search, I learned it's the tool to use. And man oh man, is it cool.

You can pick and choose different source elements, filters, ...

                    For those of you that primarily read this blog via my RSS feed, I'd appreciate it if you can update to my new feedburner one. I plan to add some flickr photos to the stream from time to time, as well some goodies from a few other sites.
You can access the new link here. I'll override the old one too at some point when I have time, but it helps if you do this manually for now. Thanks. ...
