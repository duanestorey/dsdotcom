                    I was wondering why the term "happy star wars day" was trending on Twitter. Apparently today (May 4th) is, believe it or not, Star Wars Day. It's called that because of the play on words with "May the force be with you". Since today is May 4th, people say "May the 4th be with you".
So, happy Star Wars Day everyone!
May the 4th be with you. Always. ...

Please, for the love of god, stop making movies. Whatever magic you used to bring to the table evaporated a long time ago.
As you can tell, I saw the new Indiana Jones movie on the weekend. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy it, and found myself looking at my cell phone from time to time to see how much more I had to endure.
First, you don't need CGI gophers to propagate the plot. The first time the camera swung by and I saw them, I almost groaned out loud, seeing the obvious resemblance to the little furry Ewoks that stunk up the screen during Episode VI of Star Wars. And to add insult to ...

                    Surprisingly, I have never seen this before.. It's an old opening scene from Star Wars: A New Hope. I thought it was a complete fake at first, but it looks like it was real footage that was intended to be included at one point.
What's weird is that it's sort of processed and seems to have been scored, which is unusual for anything that hits the cutting room floor. Possibly some fan added some Star Wars music to those scenes, but the music fits rather nicely which sort of makes me think it was in the movie up until the last minute.
I'm having a small HD-DVD movie marathon at my pad tomorrow. Should ...

                    I had a few people over sort of on a whim last night, and we all sat around listening to music and enjoying Christmas nachos. I'm not sure if this is officially year two or year three for the nachos, but I've been trying to up the ante each year to see if I can outdo myself.
 They Almost Don't Fit
I had a few Christmas decorations sitting around in boxes, so we all took turns throwing a few up on the tree. Keira helped herself to R2-D2, and I think I got stuck with Yoda.

Good times. Only five more days of work and then I'm off for a while. I'm getting excited about heading back home for a few ...

                    The original Star Wars Trilogy really needs no introduction, so I won't really say much about it except that it totally kicked ass, as would any trilogy involving a bad guy voiced by James Earl Jones.
This scene is a classic battle scene involving Luke and Darth Vadar, where of course Luke loses his hand at the end and ultimately learns who his real father is. And seriously, pretty much every kid who ever watches this scene spends the rest of their lives making lightsaber noises whenever they swing anything. Hell, I even hold out my hand when I approach automatic doors and pretend I'm using the ...
