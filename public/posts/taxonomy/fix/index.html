                It seems like I spend a lot of time at the Apple store trying to get things fixed. My current laptop has had the LCD replaced, and the main board twice now. My previous laptop also spent a few visits behind closed doors there as well. Truth be told, in the shower today I was trying to think of any other devices I've ever owned that have been in for repair as often, and I can't think of any. I've had each of my cameras in once to the shop, once to repair a cracked LCD (I dropped it), and once for...

I've been using Twitter for a long time now, and the one universal constant in that time period has been the flakiness of the Twitter service. Even today, at least a year after some of these problems started cropping up, you still get the occasional "Fail Whale" when the servers can't keep up. Some of the other random problems I've witnessed lately are:

disappearing avatars
the inability to upload a new avatar
missing background images on profiles
flaky service (i.e. the Fail Whale)

                Years ago, had I gone to the dentist with a chip in my tooth, they probably would have just polished it up a bit with the grinder and sent me home. Thankfully, with all the advances in material science, that is no longer the case.
I had a scheduled cleaning with my dentist today, and just in passing I mentioned the chip in my tooth that I somehow obtained in Ottawa. It wasn't really that visible, and mostly was just a small annoyance to me (since it had a different texture when I rubbed my tongu...
