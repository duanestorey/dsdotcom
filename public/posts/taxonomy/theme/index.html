                    One of my goals over the holidays was to rework my personal website. I actually really liked the previous theme, but over the course of the last six months or so have received numerous emails from people that either a) didn't like the black background or b) didn't like the font usage and sizes (granted, I actually like really tiny fonts, which isn't that great from a usability perspective).
I sat down in front of the TV tonight at around 9pm and decided to try and hack something out that would make it easier for that group of people, while also allowing me to make a few improvements with regards ...

                    I was talking to a few people on the weekend about this current iteration for my theme, and it seems there's enough interest that I might eventually set this up as a download, or add it to the WordPress theme repository. But, I'd like a bit more input from some photographers about features I can potentially add.
One thing I was thinking of incorporating was a stand-alone microstock service. For example, beside each photo there would be a "Buy" button that would take you to PayPal. Once you paid your $5 or whatever, you'd get an email with a large version of the photo and a license to use the photo. ...

                    As you can see, things have changed around here a bit. I actually still have quite a bit left to do on this theme, but it's functional enough that I put it live. I'm going to do a custom template for the upcoming Blogathon event, and also flesh out the content in a few more areas. But it's definitely getting close. Thanks to Dale for his help with this too. ...

                    I had a bit of time yesterday (really, I didn't, but the creative juices were flowing and I wanted to start dabbling), so I started tinkering with some ideas for a new theme for this site. While I routinely update the theme on this site (I average about every four months or so), I really want the next one to be up here for quite some time, so I'm not going to rush development on it.
I have a few basic goals for the new theme:

The theme should put more focus on aspects of my life such as photography, and less on my other content
The theme will focus more on my life, and some of my passions (such ...

                    I started playing with a new look and feel for my blog last week, and finished most of it off tonight. I had hacked my other one quite a few times and ended up breaking a few things on it. Hopefully this one will stay lean and mean a little while longer.
I still have to fix up the content on many of the subpages, but the main pages should be working mostly. I'm also going to be modifying the content to reflect my move out to Chilliwack in a few weeks, and of course going full time with BraveNewCode.
I have a few more ideas with regards to showing images and what not, but this is a pretty good ...

                    Well, it was an interesting day in the blogosphere, one that I'm thankful is over. Tonight I was sitting at home debating drinking myself into a coma when Rebecca pinged me online and said I should come over for wine. I was pretty comfy in my flannel pants and briefly debated staying at home. But since I really needed a few drinks, I decided to head over as I was, flannel pants and all. So for the last few hours I've been sitting on Rebecca and John's couch in my flannel pants with a big-ass afghan draped over me. It was pretty much exactly what I needed tonight (although I'm looking forward to ...

                    My dad suggested that it might be a cool idea to have a theme every once and a while. So this week, I've decided to make the theme:
REFLECTIONS
The idea is that you should take photos of the world that show some type of reflection. Be inventive, but some ideas are puddles, lakes, mirrors, glass, spoons, anything that casts a reflection. Send them in and I'll try to put them all in a group somewhere to reflect everyone's efforts!
While not a stellar example, I took a shot today of some buildings with some cool reflections of other buildings in them. However, I'd encourage people to be a bit more ...
