                    I've had gravatars on this site a few times over the last few years, but they always seem to disappear whenever I do a retheming. I've added them back in the comments and also added the last comment to the main page along with a gravatar.
If you don't have a photo next to your name when you comment, that means you don't have a public gravatar available. If you want one, head over to Gravatar.com and sign up. It's free, and as soon as you add your photo to it you will start noticing it automatically show up on various sites around the internet. If you don't define one you're going to end up as ...

                    Today I took the plunge and quickly upgraded my Wordpress installation from 2.3.3 to the Beta for 2.5. In terms of look and feel on the front-end, I doubt you'll notice any major changes (especially on sites where you don't have to login). However, they've completely overhauled the administration section in the back to make things a little easier to find.
