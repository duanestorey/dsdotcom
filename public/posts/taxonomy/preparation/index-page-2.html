Today is November 4th, and my flight to Buenos Aires leaves on January 4th, 2011. That means there are only 60 days left to go until I depart on my big adventure. It wasn't that long ago I was doing a post in celebration of 150 days to go, and now here we are at the two month point.
I'm heading to Mexico tomorrow via WestJet in Vancouver. I spent most of last night packing my suitcase and trying to get my apartment as clean as possible in case my landlord decides to show the apartment while I'm gone. In truth, there really isn't too much more to do in my apartment when I return. Other than the ...

                    It would be pretty hard to call myself a Migratory Nerd if I wasn't in fact a pretty big technology nerd. Thankfully, I have enough photography and technological gear around here that it's pretty easy to describe myself as a nerd.
In a perfect world, I'd be able to bring everything along with me. But given that I want to travel with a 40L backpack, I'm not really going to have a ton of room in there.
The following is a list of the technology I'll be bringing along on my little adventure.

I'm originally from a small little town about 150 kilometres east of Vancouver called Chilliwack. It's a picturesque farming town nestled between a few mountain ranges, and far enough away from Vancouver to have a little peace and quiet.
And while Chilliwack is my birthplace and where my most of my family lives, I've spent nearly a third of my life living in Vancouver, either out at UBC where I did nine years of post secondary education, or in the downtown core, where I've worked the majority of my career.
When I set out on my upcoming travel adventure, it'll be from a familiar place: Vancouver ...

                    There was a time when I had over $6,000 worth of camera gear sitting in my computer room. I love photography, and having a whole kit full of professional lens is great to have, but it's not really very practical to lug that much gear around, especially if you're trying to travel light.
I've spent a lot of time over these last few months thinking about what type of camera gear to bring. My first plan was to simply take along a high-end point and shoot camera and make due with that. Given that my old Canon Digital Elph was dying, I went out and bought one of the nicest compact cameras I could find: ...

I decided about six weeks ago that I wanted to have a completely different online presence for my travel adventures. While my personal site has served me well by allowing me to write about personal subjects and technology over the last few years, it's become somewhat disjointed. So, with conscious effort I have finally managed to put something together with a specific focus: travel.
Unlike most versions of my website, which normally take all of about two or three days for me to get online, I've slowly been tinkering with this one for the past few weeks. I haven't had a lot of time, so mostly ...

                    In just 45 days, I'll be out of my apartment out in Chilliwack, and essentially homeless for the next 30 days. Truthfully, now that my place is partially boxed up, I'm getting antsy to hit the open road. My current plan is to have a lot of my stuff already in storage around November 1st, so I can possibly go visit a few people in the United States in November.

As I mentioned before, I'm also heading to the Mayan Riviera in just three weeks, which will be a nice break from the norm. I haven't had a vacation in the sun since about the same time last year, so I'm definitely looking forward to chilling ...

I pulled a pile of boxes out of storage today and started the packing process. I don't technically have to be out of my apartment until the end of November, but my plan is to have a storage facility rented for November 1st. At that point, there's no reason why I can't load it up and get most of the big stuff done. I'm also going to be pretty busy in November (I'll be in Mexico for a week, and have a few weekend activities going on), so I'm not sure how much time I'll have then to get it all done.
I packed up about 50% of my office today, and the majority of the electronics in my living room. ...

                    Well, according to my little Excel spreadsheet, my trip begins in 96 days now. Depending on whether or not you’re a glass is half full or half empty kind of person, that will seem like a lot of time or not very much. It doesn’t seem like very much time to me, considering how much I need to still do before taking off.

First, I gave notice on my apartment the other day. My landlord confirmed it today, which basically means the clock is ticking on this place. I’ve been waiting for October to officially arrive before starting the mad craigslist dash to sell pretty much everything that isn’t ...

This morning I put a deposit down on a nice apartment right in the heart of the trendy area in Buenos Aires, Palermo Soho. Soho, of course, is a reference to a hip, upbeat area in New York City.
Given that I'm only staying for three months, I thought I would spend my time in the cool part of the city. Palmero Soho is extremely green, with lots of parks and trees. In addition, it's also full of great restaurants, pubs, patios, and shopping.
In Buenos Aires it's next to impossible to get a super cheap apartment unless you have a local guarantor. That said, the place I'm renting is a pretty good ...

                    I was thinking a few things through yesterday, and came up with a slightly different plan. My last plan was to give my apartment up at the end of December, and then take off in the first few days of January. I'm happy with the January departure date, but not so happy that Christmas would probably involve lots of box packing and moving.
So I came up with a plan B.
I think I'm going to give my apartment up for the end of November, and be totally homeless at that point. I already asked my dad if it's ok if I use their upstairs bedroom off and on in December, which they said it was. Plus, I'm sure ...

                    My goal on my trip is to get myself down to a single backpack when I leave. It's obviously going to be a pretty technologically heavy backpack, but it's still going to be pretty light. Most people I know who have traveled say that the amount you enjoy yourself on trips is inversely proportional to the amount of stuff you bring along, and I can totally believe that.
That's not to say you can't purchase items when you arrive, because that's what I plan to do. But in terms of what I take along, here's a short list of what I'm planning on taking:

13" Macbook Pro (just got it -- nice and light)
