                    In just a few weeks, I'll be boarding a plane and making the roughly four hour trip to Ontario (seven if you count a quick nacho stopover in Calgary). As I've indicated on Facebook, my plan is to move to Hamilton, Ontario for probably a year or so, mostly to work with Dale on some projects at BraveNewCode. Without a doubt I'm looking forward to a new change, as I originally moved out here to Chilliwack to help get BraveNewCode off the ground, something that happened nearly five years ago.

In terms of logistics, Ontario is actually quite a bit better for me. It's closer to Europe, which I love ...

                    Two of my friends, Dale and Patrick, are currently out from Ontario visiting. For the most part, it's been a university type weekend, filled with late movie nights and copious amounts of beer. We've also been eating for six people, even though we're only three, thanks mainly in part to Patt's love of cooking.

On Saturday we woke up in the morning and decided it was such a nice day that we'd head down to Stanley park for a few hours. We ended up on the patio at Lift, drinking a few beers around their outdoor fire pit. Jump ahead a few hours later and we found ourselves visiting a friend in the ...

                    Well, I made it. The flight was, for the most part, uneventful. I actually had to stop in Edmonton briefly which was unexpected. That being said, it got me off the plane for 20 minutes to stretch and get a bit of sunshine, which was nice.
In fact, it was one of the most enjoyable flights in a while. I spent most of it reading a book I picked up in the Vancouver airport called "From Good To Great" which methodically investigated the top 11 companies in the last 30 years to see what they did differently than the rest. I usually don't like business books as most of the authors seem to be full of ...
