                I few months ago I blogged about the fact that I had finally purchased a ticket to go to Peru and see Machu Picchu. Unfortunately due to the launch of WPtouch Pro 3, I wasn't able to go at the time, and ended up tossing a $1,000 plane ticket in the garbage since Expedia wouldn't give me a refund.
All in all though the launch was a big success, so I can't really complain. Sacrifices like that are part of owning your own business, and why I personally don't feel as guilty when I enjoy a bit of rel...

For whatever reason, people keep acting like the only way to do what I'm doing is to be filthy rich. That is the myth I mentioned in my other post about world travel only being attainable for millionaires. Tim Ferris has a great example in his book about some actor saying if he won a million dollars he would take a few months off and motorcycle around Thailand - Tim's point is that you can do that for probably a few thousand dollars, so no need to gamble that experience on the lottery, just sav...

                I read this fairly alarming (although not entirely surprising) article yesterday detailing how prescription drugs are being detected in municipal water sources.

A vast array of pharmaceuticals -- including antibiotics, anti-convulsants, mood stabilizers and sex hormones -- have been found in the drinking water supplies of at least 41 million Americans, an Associated Press investigation shows. ..
â€¢ Officials in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said testing there discovered 56 pharmaceuticals or...
