                Rebecca Bollwitt is one of those rare people who doesn't need an introduction. Her Vancouver blog, Miss604.com, is well known in Canada and parts of the United States, and has been voted the #1 Vancouver blog for the last four years. Rebecca has organized several conferences in the Vancouver area, including two WordCamps, several Twestivals, and several blog-until-you-pass-out 24-hour sessions of Blogathons.
Not only is Rebecca actively involved with Vancouver and her website, but her and her hu...

                Traveling the world for leisure is obviously a great adventure. While I get to enjoy the weekends and the evenings, I'm also working as I travel, so most of my days are spent building plugins for WordPress and helping keep things afloat. But I do get to venture out from time to time free of computers and cell phones and enjoy some of what the world has to offer, for example, this weekend's trip to the famous Iguazu Falls.

But other types of travel are for more nobler causes. As an example, a go...

That's Rebecca and Teddy at my place in Chilliwack. Teddy was given to me by my grandma when I was less than a year old. I've had him ever since, and have been keeping him around for when my first kid is born. As a kid, Teddy and I went through lots of hard times, and it's pretty encouraging to know he's still around to see me through the bad times, even as an adult.
When my grandma went into surgery years ago, I thought I'd return the favour, and left Teddy under her arm in the recovery room a...

                Tomorrow (depending on when you read this), is Rebecca Bollwitt's birthday (or Friday, if you're looking for an absolute time). I first met Rebecca at Northern Voice 2007 I believe, and had just come out of my first round of surgery (thanks to those four idiots who put me in the hospital). It was a time when I desperately needed the support of others the most, and a role her and John took up instantly in my life. Since that time, Rebecca and John have become really close friends of mine here in ...

                Yes people, it's that time again. BarCamp Vancouver is only a few hours from kicking off down at WorkSpace in GasTown.
For those of you not familiar with it, BarCamp is an unconference where people get together and determine the topics at the conference the day of the event. Everyone who attends is potentially a speaker, so it's a great forum for learning new things and being expose to new ideas.

                Well, I would hope that Rebecca would need no introduction in this city. But that being said, Rebecca has gone out of her way time and time again to throw link love towards other bloggers, and share whatever knowledge she can with others. So, the least I can do for a good friend is return the favour.

Over the last few years Rebecca has firmly established her blog as the most informative and relevant source of information on Vancouver life, bar none. Her blog is a enjoyable mix of personal refle...

Be afraid. Be very afraid.
I'm heading out to watch this tonight with Rebecca, John and John. Rebecca had tickets to the Vancouver premiere and invited me along, which is totally exciting. I'm going on the record as saying I'm pretty sure this is going to suck (the trailer reminds me of a techy Blair Witch Project), but it'll be a fun suck with a bunch of friends. That sounds dirty, I know.
Check out the trailer below:

Today is my good friend Rebecca's birthday. To be honest, I'm not really sure how old she is, but I'm convinced she is dangerously close to being a cougar.
I've only known Rebecca for about a year now, but I'm thankful we've gotten to be good friends in that time.

I first met Vancouver's own Miss604, Rebecca Bollwitt, last year at the Northern Voice blogging conference. I had checked out her blog occasionally, and I recognized her from photos both on her blog, and ones taken during Matthew Good's living room show last year. Being the social guy I am, and fueled by some liquid courage, I walked up to Rebecca (who was also on her way to acquire booze) and started chatting.
Since that time, I have gotten to know Rebecca and John quite well, and am proud to ...
