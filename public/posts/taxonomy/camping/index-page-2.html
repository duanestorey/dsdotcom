                    Wow, it feels like I've been disconnected from the Internet for a very long time. I spent today somewhere between Los Angeles and San Diego, hanging out at Legoland with my family. I actually wasn't really sure what to expect, given that I haven't really been into lego in a long time. But the good news is that Legoland was a lot of fun, and it was a nice change from the line-ups and the pace of Disneyland. Also, Legoland was near the water, and was a nice change from the hot weather down in Anaheim.

                    Ok, ok. I'll take a break from writing about the iPhone. But business has been great lately - my traffic has nearly doubled in the last few days. Not like I really pay attention to those things, but it's pretty clear when there's a big prolonged spike -- clearly people are excited about the iPhone.
To be honest, while talking about web traffic, I'm actually surprised mine has stayed up. I used to host all my plugins here and sort of assumed when I finally moved them over to BraveNewCode that alot of my traffic would disappear. But for whatever reason, my traffic has actually increased quite a ...

                    A while ago I mentioned just how much fun June is going to be, and tomorrow it basically starts for me. Tomorrow after work I'm heading to a campground with a few friends for a weekend sitting around a fire and eating steak. I love camping, and really enjoy the fresh air and relatively peaceful sleeps I have when in a tent.
I booked Friday off a few weeks ago, thinking that it would in fact be nice and sunny in June. Unfortunately mother nature doesn't really look like she's going to cooperate, and rain is definitely in the forecast. But no matter -- we're troopers and have several hundred square ...

                    I got back from Deception Pass early this afternoon, and I have to say, it was a really great trip. I spent most of the time there just sitting around the campfire reading, often taking a sip from a can of beer when my attention wandered from the pages.

I took a little day trip on Saturday, driving back along the water towards Anecortes, and then south towards Oak Harbour. Driving along the open road with the windows open made me realize just how long it has been since I've gotten away for a weekend. Not only that, but it makes me extremely excited for the block of time off I'm taking in June.

                    Being that this weekend is the May long weekend, and unofficially (at least in British Columbia circles) the start of summer, I thought I might get in the car and take a little road trip. My sister and the kids are camping near Deception Pass in Washington, State, and I'm seriously considering hopping in the car later tonight and making the trek down to hang out with them.

It's supposed to be 30C, which is rather nice weather to be sitting outside. I have to see what the state of my camping gear is in the back of my car, but assuming it's all there are prepped to go, I might head out around 8pm ...

                    The one promise I made myself last year was that I was going to spend more time this summer doing the things I like. Number one on the list is of course my favourite past time, camping.
For the first time in most of my working life, I now get *three* weeks of vacation a year, as opposed to two (I should also point out many places outside of North America get four to six weeks of vacation a year), so I'm looking forward to spending more time in the wilderness this year. I sent out a few emails to some friends tonight to try and figure out somewhere to camp.

Since I have a few close friends out ...

Interestingly enough, while down in the Dominican Republic, most people there said the same thing -- that this was one of the worst summers they can remember. I'm fairly certain the UK set a rain record this summer, based on something I heard and read while down in the Caribbean.
Unlike most of my friends, I'm not particular fond ...

                    Last weekend, I got together with Boris, Dustin and Dori, and headed up north of Whistler towards Birkinhead Lake. It was a last minute trip, decided upon while we were all under the influence, but we all decided we could use a break from the city.

So on Saturday morning, at the crack of dawn, we all piled into my car and set out on the quest for fish (which would later become the quest for nachos). Surprisingly, everyone's camping gear fit into the back of my hatcbback, but I think next year I'm definitely going to get a roof rack for it.

Kris Krug has done a pretty stellar job of organizing these from time to time, and it's a good chance for people to get together, learn a few tricks, and hang out with good company.
We strolled around the tracks is Gastown, then made a loop around and came back through Blood Alley. Afterwards, we stopped at the Six Acres for some beers, and then eventually went to Kris' house for a little wine.

Unfortunately, the one major downside to travelling to the United States is having to go through customs on both sides.? No matter how many times I cross, or how many stamps I have in my passport, I always get grilled pretty hard.? It's gotten worse now that I have a decent ...
