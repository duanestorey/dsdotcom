                Well, I made it. I had originally been scheduled to fly out on the 2nd of January, but since I figured everyone would be tired and hungover on the 1st that I'd just head back then and get rested up for the grind again. After everyone left the hotel, I called West Jet to see if there were any openings on any flights. Pretty much the only one that worked was the 7am flight out of Toronto. Since it was already 4am, I figured I might as well just head to the airport and sleep on the plane.
Of course...

                I spent most of the morning in bed on my second day of Toronto, which was fine by me since the bed here is super comfy. The rest of the day is pretty much a blur for me. Tony and I met Christie for lunch, and then walked around and did a bit of shopping. I picked up a nice scarf and Tony got some gloves and a hat, so we're both officially winter people now.

After that I went back to the hotel and had a little nap prior to the little hockey game party we had at my hotel.

                Well, judging from the beer bottles all around me and the chinese food stain on the bed, I think I had a pile of fun last night. I did my best to keep track of how many beers I had via facebook, but it looks like I lost count at the end or had trouble counting.
I went with Raymi and Phil to the hospital when I arrived in the hotel since she hasn't been feeling that well. There they gave my a Christmas present, which included this cute little guy that plays the guitar (thanks guys, I'll post a ph...

                In Toronto and in the hotel. Fuckers gave me a king sized bed when I asked specifically for two doubles or whatever. Still an ongoing battle there. I changed my seat around prior to the flight so that hopefully nobody was going to be sitting next to me. Thankfully that plan came together and I had the whole row to myself. About 2 seconds after lifting up I made a make-shift bed out of all three seats and someone managed to sleep for most of the flight.

                Wow.. I'm beat. I made the mistake of staying up late last night, thinking that I would be tired enough to pass out and get a few hours. Unfortunately, I hardly slept at all last night, and am at the airport, completely bagged. It's 5:50am, and I have another 40 minutes before the plane boards. Clearly I was a bit tired last night as well, since I drove all the way to my landlord's house to drop off six checks that I somehow made out in the wrong amount on all of them (something that wasn't disc...

                A few minutes ago, I took the last of the foul-tasting, side-effect inducing crud that I started nearly four weeks ago. The last few days have been particularly hard, and I've found myself extremely tired, have had a metallic taste in my mouth, and also a fairly bad migraine. While most of my family played board games tonight, I was forced to retire to the couch in the other room and attempt to out-sleep my pounding head.

                Last night I made the long trek out of the downtown core and ended up near Metrotown, which surprisingly isn't as far away as I imagined. Chad has a really nice pad out there, complete with an outdoor deck that would be just killer for summer parties and BBQing.
Chad has a tradition at his party where everyone has to pick a decoration for the tree, and then proceed to make love to it somehow. Not sure how this came to be, but everyone eagerly began licking and kissing their decorations.

                Raymi promised me a tipsy iChat later with her and Phil, which means I need to start drinking. I have so much wine at my place it's not even funny. Somewhere on the order of 25 bottles I think. But, I'm a bit tired of wine lately.
Wall Of Poison
So, I think I'm going to go for rum and diet coke, which is pretty much my drink of choice if I'm at a pub these days.

Which would you choose?...
