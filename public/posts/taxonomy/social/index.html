                Well, the event is all over now, and I officially have a small hangover to remember it by. I met a lot of really great people last night at the social, and it was a ton of fun. I have yet to meet a blogger I didn't like, and last night was no exception. Everyone was friendly, and a pleasure to hang out and drink beer with.
The social event was at Pete's Tavern, which is conveniently located directly across from the baseball stadium. The bar was completely open as were the pool tables upstairs, so there was lots to do. I tried my best to walk around and meet as many people as I could, but I'm sure ...

                Tonight was the big Northern Voice social event down at the Waldorf Hotel in East Van. I was really looking forward to attending, and it didn't disappoint in the least. I hardly ate at all beforehand, so the thought of roast pig keep me going most of the afternoon.
First of all, I have to say I was the luckiest guy in the house, having been fortunate enough to make an entrance with these two fine looking women:
Rebecca and Keira-Anne
Unfortunate Rebecca's husband (and all around great dude) John couldn't make it - he was missed, but will be leading a podcasting session tomorrow so make sure you ...

                For those of you who don't know, the Internet Engineering Task Force is a group of people that ultimately decide the technologies that will ultimately be engrained into the internet. UDP, TCP, SSL, HTTP - these are all examples of technologies that were originally put through the IETF before becoming standards.
Next week, the 70th IETF meeting will be hosted here in Vancouver. A bunch of people from our company usually participate in the sessions, and I might swing by and check out what's new and exciting. One of the best parts about meetings like this is that it brings together a bunch of the ...
