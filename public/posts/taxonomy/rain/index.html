                I spent most of this weekend chilling out around the house. I took a bit of time out on Saturday to hit a few legs of the circle farm tour with Raeleigh and Eileen. One of these days I'll manage to hit the rest of the places on the tour, but I'm slowly nailing them, a month at a time.
I've been meaning to take a weekend trip somewhere, but with the rain I haven't been motivated enough to get in the car lately. I want to get rid of my travel VISA soon, since it has a yearly fee attached to it, bu...

                It seems like it's been raining out here forever. Maybe it's because I spend so much time at home lately, and I can constantly hear the little pitter-patter of raindrops on the rooftop vents. Regardless, it's making me more and more excited to be on the beach in about seven days now.
Tomorrow I'm taking it pretty easy since it's a stat holiday. That said, we're going to push out some quick updates for WordTwit and WPtouch which should hopefully allow the two to start working together. If you use...

                Today is of course Remembrance Day. It's a holiday here in BC, but unfortunately I'm at work today. Ultimately, that's not a bad thing, since in exchange we're getting some extra time off around Christmas time.

There's a lot I could say about today, but browsing around the Vancouver web it seems others have already said it for me. But I'm obviously thankful for the sacrifices others made so that we can enjoy the freedoms we have today.
Outside it's rather dismal out today. I ended up driving to...

                This is the first weekend in ages where I really don't have a pile of plans. Given that it's absolutely horrible outside, I think I'm going to get some groceries, make some coffee, and watch movies on the couch most of the weekend.
If I do watch a movie, I'll probably pop in the extended edition of the Fellowship Of The Ring, since I haven't watched it in ages. What better way to spend your weekend than going on a 12 hour journey into the heart of Middle Earth?

Right now I'm working from home, ...

                Right now, in Las Vegas, is the huge Blog World Expo. Most of the Vancouver tech-scene is down there, including Rebecca, &amp; Arieanna and Ianiv. Last night I decided to head down this morning and join them until Monday morning, since it looked like they were having such a great time. I actually found a pretty decent flight special late last night, and I booked it for this morning.
Unfortunately, when 5am rolled around and I had to get up for the airport this morning, I didn't really feel all t...

                I've been messing around a bit more with photoshop in the evenings, and one day soon I'll read the huge 1000 page book I have on it as well. Here's something I was messing with a bit last night. It's a shot from my patio looking easy towards Yaletown. The bridge is the Granville Street Bridge.

The whole image involved work on about 5 different layers in photoshop. The rain was a bit trickier than I imagined, and it's not entirely convincing, but it's a good start....
