                Well, folks, Blogathon is over. Most of us left workspace sometime around 6:30am yesterday. I went with Rebecca and John back to their place, and we got there probably close to 7am or so. While everyone was totally fried, there was brief talk about watching a movie for a while to help the brain ramp back down to sleep mode. I laid down on the couch then, and woke up a few hours later to some of the sounds of downtown Vancouver.
At that point I adjusted some blankets, and fell asleep again, waking up sometime around 12:30pm. Unfortunately, I couldn't really sleep anymore, so I decided to just get ...

                Well, thus ends Blogathon 2009 - it was quite the adventure, one that I'm glad I was a part of again. The official Blogathon website shows approximately $40,000 raised for the various charities this weekend, which is totally awesome. Of that amount, approximately $1,250 was raised by the content on this blog, and by the people who supported my efforts and the BC Children's Hospital Foundation. So once again, you guys all have my sincerest thanks.
But while the donations and money are obviously appreciated, this event is about more than money. It's about a group of people banding together to make ...

                This is my second last entry, which means Blogathon is almost over. This was was definitely a lot harder for me than the one last year, mainly because I started the event already in a pretty exhausted state. But no matter - the end is near.
I'm sitting on the couch here at Workspace, watching the start of another sunrise. By the time this day is over for me, I will have seen two sunrises, a gorgeous sunset, and even a lightning storm. Not a bad day at the office if I do say so myself.
With everyone's help, we raised approximately $1250 for the BC Children's Hospital Foundation, and for that everyone ...

The following is a guest post by Tia Everitt from Chilliwack -- thanks for the contribution

Chilliwack.
It was the one place my husband and I swore up and down that we would NEVER, EVER live.
It was a place we raced through on the highway, en route to the Okanagan, or to get back to Vancouver. We plugged our noses as we gagged on the cloying, ever-present stench of cow manure. We snickered at the tacky billboards all the way in and out of the Fraser Valley. We made jokes about inbreeding. We chuckled at the omnipresent “Corn Barns” that dotted the landscape in the summer. From time to time ...

                I actually remember last year about this time, when I hit the 40 mark. It's a good feeling, mainly because everyone can see the light at the end of the tunnel. But we still have a bit more time here, so I'll keep pumping out blog entries! Donations are still open, so if you're still up and feel like contributing to the BC Children's Hospital, then please do so -- your donation will be appreciated, and will go directly to helping out the children there.
There was a pretty wild sunset in Vancouver tonight, and I managed to grab a photo of it. So I'll end this blog entry with a photo of the sun setting ...

                Tomorrow should be an interesting day. We're going to leave Workspace here sometime around 6am. With any luck, I'll be fast asleep sometime around 6:15am. Tomorrow there's a baby shower on the north shore that I'd really like to attend, so as of now I'm hoping to hit that. But in the odd event I feel like complete garbage tomorrow, I'll just head back home. But, assuming I feel ok, I'll be swinging by the North Shore for a while tomorrow.

Surprisingly, most people are still here from this morning. Everyone is obviously a bit tired, but most people are soldiering on. I'm hoping to go to a housewarming tomorrow for a while, which means I need to find a place to hole up and get a few hours of sleep after this.

Given that I only had five hours of sleep last night, I should feel way worse than I already do. But strangely enough, I feel not bad. I went down to the Lamplighter and picked up a few beers with Paul, so I've been casually sipping a few while staring out onto the water.

To give you some context, Vancouver has demonstrated that it is at the forefront of social media. Many people here without true old-school media credentials have covered many events as members of the press. Rebecca has covered a lot of events simply as a representative of her website, Dave O has covered a few different Olympics, and I've covered a few music events, including the 2008 Canadian Juno awards.

                Seems like the Blogathon gods are mad, and are punishing those people on Vancouver's north shore who weren't blogging today. From my vantage point, it's pretty gloomy over there. We've been watching lightening strikes for a while hit the mountains over there. While John Biehler thinks he's safe, I'm pretty sure he's in for a world of hurt over there, but we'll see.

My mom called a while ago and said that it was pretty stormy out in Chilliwack. Given that I didn't water my plants before I left, I'm actually kind of thankful to hear that. Hopefully when I get back tomorrow they're all still alive ...

                This is one of my favourite shots. I took it down at the Celebration of Light two years ago. It was my first real time shooting fireworks with my camera. Unfortunately, I didn't have a tripod, so I basically experimented all night with settings that would allow me to handhold a fireworks shot. I ended up with a few keepers, but a lot of the ones I shot ended up being a bit blurry (which is why a tripod is usually preferable).

There are fireworks here in Vancouver tonight, but right now it's a bit rainy. So we'll see how things look around 10:05pm when the first few go off. ...
