                Last night a few of us went down to check out a little party on a boat docked in Puerto Madero. Puerto Madero is the area on the east of Buenos Aires that is one of the newest, trendiest (also, more expensive) areas within Buenos Aires, and is home to a lot of skyscrapers, one of which houses Microsoft's offices here.
It was the first time I hazarded to take my DSLR out in public, and I'm really glad I did. Truthfully, it's been great getting back into photography, since I essentially took a few...

                About a month ago I got an email from Coast Hotels asking if I'd like to partake in an all-inclusive weekend in Victoria with a few other bloggers and social media people from Vancouver. Given how much fun I had in Victoria last summer with Arieanna and Ianiv for the BC Festival 150 concert, I jumped at the opportunity, especially since Coast Hotels was supplying the accommodation and transportation.

The trip will start off on Friday morning at the Coast Hotel in Vancouver -- everyone is meetin...

                It appears that things are almost back to normal with regards to my blog. I had to juggle the DNS entries around a bit the other day, and that caused a period of time where both versions of my blog existed on the internet for a while. I think for the most part most people will be directed to this one, which is the way it should be.

                I spent most of the morning in bed on my second day of Toronto, which was fine by me since the bed here is super comfy. The rest of the day is pretty much a blur for me. Tony and I met Christie for lunch, and then walked around and did a bit of shopping. I picked up a nice scarf and Tony got some gloves and a hat, so we're both officially winter people now.

After that I went back to the hotel and had a little nap prior to the little hockey game party we had at my hotel.

                This is a pretty important week in the life of Duane. On Tuesday I'll meet up with my plastic surgeon which might potentially be the last meeting I have with him regarding this whole affair. My first meeting was about twelve months ago and resulted in two surgeries to my eye socket. I've spent this last year bouncing between doctors offices, getting eye exams, several CT scans, and will meet this week to probably wrap everything up.
In terms of my vision, it's still not perfect. I see pretty muc...

                So this afternoon I headed down to a little church in east Vancouver to shoot some photos for Vancouver fashion week. Thanks to Urban Vancouver I have been able to acquire a media pass so that I basically have full access at all these events (something that I didn't realize until today, since the pass I received today was exactly the same as the one I had on Thursday night).
Today was a mix of dresses and lingerie, and I had a really great time hanging out with some of the people I had met at th...

Now maybe that's the caffeine talking, or maybe it's some weird chemical reaction taking place in my brain (due to the lack of carbs in my diet of late), but it's been a few days since I've written anything, and I'm in a good mood.

Starting at 1pm this afternoon, a group of internet enthusiasts will be gathering down at the Bryght offices for some food, drinks, Nintendo Wii and lots of fun. It's going to be a chance to mingle with like-minded people, enjoy some music, and even catch up on whatever internet-related project you currently have on the go.
I'll be meeting up later tonight with Kris, Kim, Boris, Rebecca, John, and a whack of other people I haven't met yet. I think Kim even challenged me to a ...
