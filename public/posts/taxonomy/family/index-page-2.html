                    So I'm currently at my mom's place looking at her new computer. While checking out her new monitor, she spilled the goods:
Mom: "Hey, you know that blog entry about people getting to your blog by googling duanestorey.com" Me: "Yah" Mom: "Don't tell anyone, but it was us.. That's what we do"
So there you have it. My mom needs a few lessons in how to browse the web. I still love her though. Even though it means I might be adopted. ...

                    Well, that's it folks -- 2007 is basically all over. For me, it was undoubtedly one of the hardest years in my life. I have usually always been able to find the good in things that sometimes turn out bad, but this last year is one that for the most part I am happy to leave behind.

That being said, I have lots of good memories from this last year. Rob's wedding. Massey Hall show in Toronto. Crazy halloween eyeball smashing party. Las Vegas. The Dominican Republic. Drunk Camp. Finland. New friends. Old friends.
Tomorrow night I'll be bouncing around Toronto, and for the first time in quite a few ...

                    Ahh, relaxation. Definitely enjoying it. I've been sleeping lots, eating lots, and watching a pile of movies. For the most part, my ass has been firmly planted on the living room couch, but I've managed to get outside a bit and see some relatives.

Today is Christmas over at my sister's house. Since my parents are split, today is Christmas with my mom's side of the family. I have two gifts each for my niece and nephew, so I'll bring one set over today and leave the other here at my dad's for tomorrow's round. Us adults don't really buy for each other, but we've always sort of enjoyed getting the ...

                    I haven't been much of a blogger lately, and I'm not sure why that is. I've had a lot of ideas about what would make for some interesting entries, but lately with everything going on I just haven't really been able to write anything. Hopefully I'll start to change that.

I spent the weekend up at Cultus Lake with John and Rebecca, and I had a great time - check out Rebecca's entry for all the details. We drank an impressive amount of booze considering we were there for only two nights. Most of my immediately family made it up for a visit, and it was good to see them all again. For whatever reason, ...

By Friday I'm definitely going to be ready for a few drinks (or maybe a long nap).
Anyways. I was chatting wtih my brother-in-law on MSN earlier today, and he let me know that their house was broken into in Chilliwack this morning. The guys made away with most of the expensive ...
