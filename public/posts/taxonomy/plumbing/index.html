                    So before going to bed last night I walked into my second bathroom as was greeted with a not-so-nice smell. I thought maybe I had forgot to flush the toilet or something stupid like that, but everything was totally clean. I turned the fan on for a while, thinking it would go away, but it didn't really seem to. This morning the smell was still there, and I debated calling my building manager to see if they could take a look (or a smell).
Before doing that though, I Googled around a bit to see if I could figure it out. One thing I found out is that there's U-shaped pipe under each drain that's called ...

                    In just four days, I get to swing out to Chilliwack and grab the keys for my new place. First thing I'm looking forward to is turning the heat on in the new apartment, as it was pretty cold there when I swung by for a visit in December. My furniture is supposed to be delivered on January 20th, but I think I'm going to put the call in to deliver it on the morning on the 15th or something. I have to leave work a bit early on the 14th to make it to Chilliwack in time to do the walk-through on my place, but I'd like to do that part myself and meet my landlord as well.
