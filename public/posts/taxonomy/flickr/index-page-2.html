                About six months ago I released the Crossroads wordpress plugin. I haven't really kept up to date with the usage statistics for it, but today I stumbled upon them.
There are currently 370 authenticated users, generating around 20,000 API calls a day to Flickr. Not bad....

                I've really been trying hard to get a new release of Crossroads out for quite some time, but with my job at work, it's just so hard to find a few hours to spare these days. That being said, I've up-reved the plugin to version 2.0, and am making the changes I've done available as a download. This is an early alpha, and for sure it has a few bugs, so please don't expect it to be perfect.
Compared to version 1.0, here are some changes:

Added support for GreyBox image gallery

                A while ago I attended a small function and snapped a pile of photos at it, putting most of them into a Flickr set so that others could view them and use them. While sitting at work today, I did a quick Google search to see if there were any other photos from the function, or any write-ups about it. After a few clicks, I came across one site, and immediately noticed that they had used a bunch of my photos in their blog entry. Unfortunately, not only did they not link back to the original photos,...

Flickr sort of came to the limelight about 18-24 months ago as one of the leading websites that had real Web 2.0 technology. If you haven't been there you should definitely check it out. Most of the website utilizes Ajax and as you use it, sometimes it feels more like ...

                On May 5th, Flickr is having a big world-wide event were everyone is being asked to record a day of their life in photos.

                A few months ago, I wrote a flickr plugin for wordpress that integrated with a few different image galleries including Lightbox and Greybox. As last count, 126 different blogs were using the crossroads plugin to show their flickr images in their posts.
While updating my blog theme last night, I realized one of the current problems I have with most of the themes I downloaded. Typically, a theme will present the full content of a few blog entries on the main page. A few of the "cooler" themes I've...

                Well, it's only been a little over a week since I open sourced the plugin used on this website. So far, based on the flickr API key statistics, it looks like 25 people are using it, which is pretty cool. A couple of people have emailed me a few suggestions, so I'm gonna try to release a new version soon incorporating some of them.
If you are using it, then drop me a line and let me know!...

                So there's this buzz amongst photographers about this new technique called HDR (high dynamic range). The basic idea is that a camera isn't capable of capturing nearly as much dynamic range as what our eyes can capture.? With HDR, you take multiple shots of the same scene using a digital camera on a tripod, and create a new photograph using the information from all the shots. That new image contains a much larger dynamic range than would be possible using any one shot.
Here are some cool examples...
