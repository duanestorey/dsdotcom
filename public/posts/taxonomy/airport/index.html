                    Last weekend I flew up to Puerto Iguazu and checked out Iguazu Falls. It was a great trip, and it was nice to get out of town for a few days. Puerto Iguazu reminded me a lot of Tofino actually, without the surfing. It was a quant little village with only a few main streets. The people were friendly, the food was good, and there were less bars on the windows and graffiti than here in Palermo Soho in Buenos Aires.

The WiFi in my apartment (which is shared between about six suites) has been really dodgy lately, so I've moved over to a little coffee/pizza shop across the street. The photo pictured ...

I'm originally from a small little town about 150 kilometres east of Vancouver called Chilliwack. It's a picturesque farming town nestled between a few mountain ranges, and far enough away from Vancouver to have a little peace and quiet.
And while Chilliwack is my birthplace and where my most of my family lives, I've spent nearly a third of my life living in Vancouver, either out at UBC where I did nine years of post secondary education, or in the downtown core, where I've worked the majority of my career.
When I set out on my upcoming travel adventure, it'll be from a familiar place: Vancouver ...

                    It seems like just a few weeks ago that I was down in California with my sister. Strangely enough, tomorrow I'll be making my way south once again, this time for WordCamp San Francisco.
While I'm pretty excited to go down and meet a lot of new bloggers and WordPress enthusiasts, I can't say I'm looking forward to driving to Seattle tomorrow for my flight. For whatever reason, flying from Canada is super expensive these days, and I'm saving about $300 just by flying out of Seattle. I'm going to burn a few new CDs before the trip, so hopefully I'll have a bit of music to keep me company.

                    Well, I'm sort of packed. Given that I no longer have a dryer at home, I was forced to dry most of my clothes out on the patio over night. Good news is that most of my clothes are completely dry. Bad news is some of them aren't dry yet.

It's a nice sunny day in the Bay Area today, so I'm wearing shorts and a t-shirt. In fact, today seems like a pretty warm day in Vancouver as well, so for all of you people hanging out at home, enjoy. I'm heading down to the airport right now.

                    I was up late playing around with some stuff on the computer, and didn't manage to actually lay down until around 2:30am. I figured since I was getting up at 6:30am to drive Rebecca to the airport that four hours should be enough time. Unfortunately I think forgot to factor in the amount of caffeine I had had over the course of the evening. So when my alarm started beeping at 6:30am, I realized I hadn't really had any sleep yet.

Upon arriving at the airport, Rebecca had a call from her people out in Toronto letting her know that her flight had been cancelled. So we went to Milestone's restaurant ...

                    Well, I'm exhausted. I can rarely sleep on planes, and this trip was no different. We landed about 20 minutes ago, and all I want to do is curl up in a ball and have a nice sleep, but unfortunately I have to transfer plans in a bit and head to Ottawa. Normally I'd find a chair and try to sleep, but given that my body is about 8 hours behind on sleep now, I don't think it's a good idea to close my eyes, since I probably will sleep right through the boarding call on my plane.
The flight out here was rather uneventful, although I have to say flying in business class kicks some major ass. Not only ...
