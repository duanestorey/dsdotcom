I've been reading a lot of Breaking Bad predictions these last few days and I thought I would toss my own hat into the ring. I'm sure I'm going to be wrong on a few counts, mainly because the writers have been really great at surprising us.
There are lots of spoilers here, so don't read any of these if you aren't totally caught up with watching Breaking Bad.
Here's what we know based on the end of the last episode:

                As many people know, I tend to travel quite a bit - over the last 18 months I believe I have visited on the order of 13 or 14 countries. And while there are always interesting things to do in each new city or country I visit, sometimes I miss some of the comforts of home (such as english TV or movies).
Back home when I am bored I typically watch Apple TV or Netflix. Unfortunately when I am outside of North America and I try to access Netflix I often end up with a message like this:

                Now that I have cable again, I've been watching a bit more TV. Except for last night's Heroes and 24, I've been keeping up with all three shows.

Of them all, Lost is the only one that's really keeping me interested. I think the whole concept of 24 has just gone on too long now. I thought season two was pretty awesome, mainly because it focused on character development. Now it's more of an action flick. They had a good opportunity with that cute FBI agent, but they really haven't used her to her...

                My blog appears to be in some weird state of limbo right now, bouncing between the black and the white background, depending on where you are viewing it from. It's rather strange, considering the TTL on my DNS entry is 30 minutes, so it shouldn't take this long at all.
Anyways, here is a trailer for season 3 or Heroes. I hope Peter keeps his shirt on for more of it.

                Last night, out of sheer boredom, I drove down to Future Shop and picked up Season one of Heroes, on HD-DVD.

Rebecca and John have been recommending this series to me, so I figured I would just go along with their word of mouth and pick it up.
I'm about half way through season one already, and so far I think it's pretty good. A few of the characters I find a bit annoying, but the Tokyo guy who can bend space and time is always entertaining, as well as the guy who can read minds. I'm anxiously a...

                Nearly two years ago, I went out with my dad and step-mom and picked up a high-definition TV at future shop. Of course, having a high-definition TV without any sort of high-definition feed is rather pointless, so the first thing I did is pick up a HD cable box from Shaw. Unfortunately, I didn't realize at the time just how little TV I usually watch.
Between the HD cable option and my "high-speed" internet, I shell out around $110 a month, which is pretty stupid considering I watch only around on...
