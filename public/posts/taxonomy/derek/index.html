                Today is my sister and brother-in-law's 15th wedding anniversary. Hard to believe really, since I vividly remember being at their wedding years ago and doing the chicken dance over and over. It was a nice little wedding, right up at Cultus Lake, in a tiny little community hall that held around 80 people. In true Ukrainian fashion, the bar was completely open (a definite requirement for when I get married -- I'm willing to compromise on everything else, but the bar has to be open).
The wedding ph...

                Being that this weekend is the May long weekend, and unofficially (at least in British Columbia circles) the start of summer, I thought I might get in the car and take a little road trip. My sister and the kids are camping near Deception Pass in Washington, State, and I'm seriously considering hopping in the car later tonight and making the trek down to hang out with them.

It's supposed to be 30C, which is rather nice weather to be sitting outside. I have to see what the state of my camping gea...

                Not much new to report. Work is going fairly well, and I've met most of our Ontario company now. Derek and I hit "downtown" Kanata and hit a few local establishments tonight, which was actually a lot of fun. I have two more days here, and then I get on a plane and head to Toronto for Matt's concert. I'm actually getting pretty excited about the whole ordeal. I talked with Tony briefly tonight and he's in the same hotel as me, which is cool.

The next time I probably blog will be in Toronto, a fe...
