                    I picked up a Nexus pass about a year ago, mainly because I thought it would help with the amount of travelling I have been doing over the years. In theory, a Nexus pass will let you cross the US/Canada border without waiting in those huge line ups.
My first attempt at using my Nexus pass was by road. It's a bit scary using it, because they have so many restrictions in place for the program. For example, if you do something wrong (like attempt to bring a person across with you who isn't a Nexus card holder), they can revoke your privileges and take your card away from you indefinitely. Plus, they ...

                    About a week ago I went through the formal interview process for my Nexus Border pass. Other than when my friend Dan has been working at YVR, I can't really remember many times I've crossed the border where I didn't feel the border guard was excessively rude.
