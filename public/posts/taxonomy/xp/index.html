                    I just read this while surfing the internet - that in a comparison of Windows XP SP3 against Vista SP1, XP blew it completely out of the water:

Vista's first service pack, to be released early next year, is intended to boost the operating system's performance. However, when Vista with the Service Pack 1 (SP1) beta was put through benchmark testing by researchers at Florida-based software development company Devil Mountain Software, the improvement was not overwhelming, leaving the latest Windows iteration outshined by its predecessor.
Vista, both with and without SP1, performed notably slower ...

                    I'm officially going to blog about my frustration with Windows Vista so far. If you were following last week, I decided (stupidly) that I would upgrade my laptop from windows XP to windows Vista. First, the whole upgrade procedure took on the order of four hours, and it wasn't exact smooth all the time. The progress meters were hopelessly broken, and the pre-check that it does to make sure you can actually install vista properly got it wrong.
One thing that bothers me right away is that you can no longer install Vista on the same partition as another OS. I'm not really sure why this is, because ...

                    So, I was multitasking at work today, installing Windows Vista on my laptop, and doing some work on my desktop machine. I thought the upgrade process would be simple, but instead it was a huge headache. First, Windows Vista Installer analyzed my whole machine and told me I was good to go. Then, I start installing it and it goes "wait a sec, just joking --- you gotta remove all this software first before you can install Vista." So, I uninstall Nero, my anti-virus program and a DVD RAM drive thing that I've never used. Install, take 2.
The next part of the process is rather uneventful, but I have ...
