                    One of the downsides to always having the latest and greatest iPhone is that most places outside of North America and Europe seriously lag behind in terms of adoption rates. For places like Brazil and Argentina, that's even more true because the cost of picking up a new iPhone is nearly twice as much as we would pay in North America.
When I went to Argentina in 2012, I couldn't find a Micro SIM card anywhere, and was forced to buy a normal full-sized SIM card and perform surgery on it to make it fit into a Micro SIM holder. I had to do that twice while travelling around the world with my iPhone ...

                    I was recently generating some new server and email passwords, and realized that while most of the strong password generators available online work great for desktops, they aren't very user friendly for entering on iOS or mobile devices. Often you can find a few checkboxes and sliders for those tools to make it a bit more iPhone friendly, but they don't always work. Ideally a password that you frequently use on an iPhone or other iOS device should be "strong" (i.e. have possibly a symbol or two and a mix of upper and lower case characters), but should also be fairly easy to type.
So this morning ...

                    Anyone who uses an iPhone knows that under normal usage the battery rarely lasts a full day. When I'm at home relaxing, the battery life issue is not really that big a deal since I can simply plug my phone into the USB charger half-way through the day and top the battery up to full, usually in an hour or so.
But unfortunately when I'm traveling (which is quite often as most people know), plugging my phone into an outlet isn't always an option . Sometimes when I'm working from coffee shops it simply isn't possible to find a plug. Occasionally an airplane will have a USB port in the chair ahead ...

                    Inside my suitcase upstairs is a huge manilla envelope that has the majority of receipts in it for my trip to South America. Since some of them represent expenses that I can write-off on the business side, it was important to keep them for Revenue Canada in the odd event of an audit down the road.
Unfortunately for me though, it meant that I had to collect all my receipts while traveling around the world. It's one thing when you have an apartment in Canada and everything can be sorted into file folders once a week or so, but when you're traveling with a backpack and trying not to accumulate anything ...

                    I'm up to a little over 60 kilometres worth of biking on my new bike, and so far I'm really enjoying getting outside again. The first few rides I did were pretty painful, both from a muscle perspective and also from a cardio perspective. But I'm up to about 16 kilometres a ride now, and I can see myself doing a 25 kilometre ride fairly soon as well.
I've actually been using the RunKeeper application on my iPhone to track my progress. It's a free application as well as a free service (there's a paid upgrade option). I don't think I'll upgrade, mainly because I don't think I'd need any of the perks ...

                    This last week was a weird week. I met up with a few friends and had some great times, but it was also the first real time I've been homesick in any capacity. There was nothing really that happened to make me feel that way, I was just sitting around and realized I was a long way from home. So I spent a day or so of being a bit melancholy.
Thankfully the feeling has past, and it's business as usual again. Weekends always get me excited, mostly because I have more opportunities to get out and explore on Saturday and Sunday than during the week.
My Mac widget says I have 26 days left in Buenos Aires, ...

One of the biggest questions people always ask me about Buenos Aires is whether or not it is a safe city. Buenos Aires has an international reputation (at least lately) of being riddled with petty crime. Prior to coming here, I did quite a few scans on the internet and there is no shortage of sites talking about people's personal experiences with crime in Buenos Aires. In fact, many of the locals talk about it like getting something stolen is almost a rite of passage in this city.
Upon landing in the city for the first time, you're immediately bombarded with stores covered in iron bars and graffiti ...

I came to Buenos Aires with an iPad, a Macbook Pro, a Canon DLSR, a 28mm lens, a Kodak Playsport HD camera, and a Canon something or other point and shoot camera - quite the load. Here's a little update on how it's going.
The Good
The iPad is great for reading at home, but it's not so good for reading out in public in a city with a lot of petty crime. In fact, I don't think I've seen a single iPad down here since I've arrived. As a result, I'm thankful I brought my Kindle with me, since it blends into a coffee shop scene far easier. Right before I left Canada I purchased (or rather, my dad purchased ...

So, we're on day four of seven in the Caribbean, and so far it's been a lot of fun. Other than one cloudy day, the rest of the vacation so far has been hot and sunny, which is great. As it's still low season, the resort isn't as packed as we're used to, which is fine because we've been required to spend a lot of time doing work due to some projects we have going on back home.
Unfortunately for me, I dropped my iPhone 4 yesterday and ended up cracking the front-side protective glass. In the iPhone 3G, it would cost about $15 and some sweat and tears to replace the glass. Apparently with the iPhone ...

                    It would be pretty hard to call myself a Migratory Nerd if I wasn't in fact a pretty big technology nerd. Thankfully, I have enough photography and technological gear around here that it's pretty easy to describe myself as a nerd.
In a perfect world, I'd be able to bring everything along with me. But given that I want to travel with a 40L backpack, I'm not really going to have a ton of room in there.
The following is a list of the technology I'll be bringing along on my little adventure.

                    I've said it before, but I'm going to say it again: I think the iPhone would be a lot cooler if it had a temperature sensor on it. In terms of technology, all it is a single temperature controlled resistor (called a thermistor), probably worth about 5 cents. But it would be cool to be on a patio and be able to see how hot it is.
I also think that if everyone opted in to given this data to a central repository, that it would be possible to increase the accuracy of our existing weather models a great deal. Currently weather models are primed using sparse initial conditions. For example, in Vancouver, ...

                    Yes sports fans, it's almost that time. On Friday the highly anticipated successor to the iPhone 3GS is released. My experience so far with Rogers wireless this last week, as well as on launch days in the past, seems to indicate that Friday is going to be a complete gong show for everyone involved.
Unlike the previous launches, we now have an interesting option in Canada: we can purchase an unlocked phone from the Apple store. Unless I'm mistaken, I don't believe we've ever had that luxury in Canada, at least not with Rogers. I remember getting my first Motorola phone back in 2000 - the guy at ...

                    It's true. Sure, it might not have flash, and it might not come with 3G by default. But really, do any of those things matter when you're sitting on the porcelain god? I think not.
Obviously a laptop is too big to take into the can. Well, at least I hope nobody is taking the laptop into the can (Dan Lilly, that means you buddy). That leaves the iPhone or the iPad. iPhone works decent, but really, there are usually a variety of pads in the can, so might as well add one more. It's pretty easy to use the iPhone with one hand while grabbing some TP with the other. I imagine one will have to come up ...

                    It seems like I spend a lot of time at the Apple store trying to get things fixed. My current laptop has had the LCD replaced, and the main board twice now. My previous laptop also spent a few visits behind closed doors there as well. Truth be told, in the shower today I was trying to think of any other devices I've ever owned that have been in for repair as often, and I can't think of any. I've had each of my cameras in once to the shop, once to repair a cracked LCD (I dropped it), and once for a cleaning. So other than when I drop things or get them dirty, not many of my devices crap out on ...

                    Just for yucks, I integrated Google Latitude into the sidebar in my blog section. Google latitude, for those that don't know, allows people with GPS-enabled devices to share their locations with their friends (I think it can do it based on geo-IP as well, but that's not super exciting IMO). I'm not entirely sure showing a map with all my friends on it is particularly useful to be honest, but I thought I'd toss my location up on there for something to do.
Far better, in my opinion, would be integration with services such as IM, such that I can see my friend's list sorted by distance to me. That ...

                    So my friend Adrian is a really smart guy. I think he's completed four or more years of post secondary education, and managed the entire IT department singlehandedly at my company.
I put him up to a challenge to see how long it would take him to figure out how to get the case off my iPhone 3G. Here's the end result.
Only took him 43 seconds. Not bad.

I haven't been very quiet about my recent reservations about Google. I really don't think they really have any amazing products any more, and are heading in a downward spiral. People used to brag about Google's flat corporate structure as a huge bonus, and at first it seemed really appealing. But after recently visiting the company's main location in MountainView, and talking to a few people, I'm more of the opinion that it's hurt them more than it's helped them.
