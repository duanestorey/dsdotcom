                I actually didn't apply for a media pass, so I technically do not have access to the BC International Media Center. That said, if you have access, you can sign people in as visitors, so I'm currently down here as a guest of John Biehler.
Here's a quick video that John and I shot to give everyone a little tour of what it's like inside....

                I'm sitting here listening to Dave O talk about Vancouver's "True North Media House" that will be forming for the Vancouver Olympics. To give you some context, Vancouver has demonstrated that it is at the forefront of social media. Many people here without true old-school media credentials have covered many events as members of the press. Rebecca has covered a lot of events simply as a representative of her website, Dave O has covered a few different Olympics, and I've covered a few music events...

                Yes people, it's that time again. BarCamp Vancouver is only a few hours from kicking off down at WorkSpace in GasTown.
For those of you not familiar with it, BarCamp is an unconference where people get together and determine the topics at the conference the day of the event. Everyone who attends is potentially a speaker, so it's a great forum for learning new things and being expose to new ideas.

Rebecca Bollwitt and I are organizing a session of WordCamp tomorrow down in Granville Island, whic...

                So our pal John Biehler is currently soaking up the rays in Hawaii with his wife. It's been a long tradition of ours (and by long, I mean about two months) of having a nerd camp at my place. We had one today and John couldn't make it, so here's a quick Flickr video showing what he's been up to:...

                Last night I went over to John Biehler's house to sit around, drink diet pepsi max, and to watch a movie. We ended up renting Michael Clayton, which is a really good movie if you are looking for something to watch. John gave me a pretty exhaustive tour of the Apple TV (which they recently updated to version 2.0 of the firmware), and I have to say, had London Drugs still been open when I left his place, I would have rushed over to pick one up on my way home last night.

No matter. After bouncing ...

We all have a few projects we want to do. I'm currently moving all my websites over to Media Temple, which is basically easy but requires a bunch of grunt work to pull off. After that I'm going to attempt to make really awesome movie...

Be afraid. Be very afraid.
I'm heading out to watch this tonight with Rebecca, John and John. Rebecca had tickets to the Vancouver premiere and invited me along, which is totally exciting. I'm going on the record as saying I'm pretty sure this is going to suck (the trailer reminds me of a techy Blair Witch Project), but it'll be a fun suck with a bunch of friends. That sounds dirty, I know.
Check out the trailer below:

                7:36pm - So John and Brennen just arrived for the Friday night nerd-a-thon. We're debating what movies to watch right now while waiting for pizza to arrive. We have a big list of geeky movies here, some of which are on HD-DVD. Right now the short runners are:

The Matrix in HD
Dark City
Gladiator
Desperado
Heat
Ocean's Thirteen in HD

So we'll see how it goes. Jeff will probably show up in a bit, and I'm not sure who else. I'm guessing The Matrix will be first just to kick everything off with a ...
