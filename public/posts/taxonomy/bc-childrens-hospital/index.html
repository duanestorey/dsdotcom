                    This morning I was thinking about Blogathon while hopping in the shower, and I had that image in my head of the joker from The Dark Knight saying "And Here.... We... Go... "
In less than 48 hours Blogathon 2009 will officially kick off. Some people will be down at WorkSpace in Vancouver hanging out, and others will be congregating in the Valley somewhere. I still haven't decided where I'll end up, although I'm leaning towards the WorkSpace route, as it would be nice to hang out with some friends for the day, and cross the finish line as a group.

                    I just got off the air with The Hawk, Chilliwack's Rock station, located at 98.5 on your Chilliwack/Abbotsford dials. Rebecca Bollwitt is currently putting a recording of the broadcast on her Viddler account, at which point I'll put it up here for everyone to listen to recorded the interview, and has provided it for everyone's listening pleasure -- thanks Rebecca!
I hadn't really thought about a goal for fundraising, so I said I was going to attempt to raise $2,000. The good news is that I think that's a realistic goal, but I'll need everyone's help. So if you can help at all by pledging, then ...

                    Last night I was fortunate enough to be invited to a social media gathering in the penthouse of the Loden Hotel In Vancouver. The reason for everyone coming together was to discuss how social media can help the BC Children's Hospital annual "Chip's Not Dead Yet" Memorial Mile fundraiser that takes place in Vancouver
