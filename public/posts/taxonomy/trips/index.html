                About two months ago I was packing up my items in Buenos Aires, getting ready to fly to New York City and then to Europe. I've been out in Port Coquitlam now for almost a month and am pretty much back into the swing of my normal routine here.
I've been thinking quite a bit about the summer, and of course what my plans are after that. Everything is still up in the air, but here's how I think things will shape out.
I've been planning for quite some time to take most of July and August off. I have ...

                I don't know why, but I'm excited that it's a new month. Maybe because I'm fully booked for my trip to Igauza falls in 17 days, or possibly because it's a trip to Machu Picchu is probably on the horizon. Either way, I'm feeling fine, and today is a new day in a new month.
I left Vancouver on January 4th, so that means I've been here nearly a month now. Time flies. I have a little widget on my phone with my rough itinerary in it, and it says I have 57 days left in Buenos Aires. I fly out on March...

                How's that for a title? It'll pretty much sum my day up when it's all over.
For whatever reason, I've been super tired lately. Despite getting a fairly normal amount of sleep during the week, I've hit the last few weekends completely exhausted. Yesterday, for example, I spent a few hours sleeping on the couch by the fire. Upon waking up in the early evening, I watched a few movies, and then went straight to bed, sleeping in until around 10am (after the time change). It definitely feels great, bu...

                The tendency for a body at rest to stay at rest, and for a body in motion to stay in motion.
Two important states, to be sure. For me, I find myself bouncing between those two states from time to time, often as a result of some cycle I'm trying to break. Most of the time, that cycle for me starts with lack of sleep, and progresses into this weird state of limbo where I'm constantly feeling unhealthy. The last time I felt I totally got away from it was back in May, back when I was going to the gy...
