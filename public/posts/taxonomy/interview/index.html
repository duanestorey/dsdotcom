I first met Shira Lazar a few years ago at Launch Party Vancouver 2 I believe. Shira was up from Los Angeles to cover the event at the request of a mutual friend, Maura Rodgers. I unfortunately didn't get to talk to Shira too much that night, but have kept in touch with her periodically over email. Shira is a well known Los Angeles media personality, and blogs frequently on CBS News' On The Scene).
Shira was nice enough to do a guest entry on my blog during the 2008 Blogathon. That event helped raise raise over $10,000 for the Union Gospel Mission in Vancouver and some of Vancouver's homeless.

                    I went to bed last night at around 11pm, and slowly drifted off to sleep. For the most part, I had a decent sleep, and managed to get myself out of bed at around 7am. So I think I'm basically recovered from Blogathon at this point.
I was just up at Cultus lake sorting out my registration. There was a line up of cars about 20 deep waiting for the registration office to open, so it took me about an hour to get to the front. Of course, there were a few people who showed up and cut right to the front of the line, thinking for some reason that a re-registration or some issue from the night before was ...

                    I was killing some time while waiting for Chris to get off work so we could go see a movie. So, I popped in the nearest movie on my rack, which just happened to be Back to the Future. Usually while I watch a movie at home, I'll surf the net and investigate random things that spark my interest while watching the show. So, I was surfing to see what happened with all the people from the movie since 1985. I found a funny youtube video of Marty McFly's dad (Crispin Glover) from an interview on David Letterman. It's almost painful to watch. ...
