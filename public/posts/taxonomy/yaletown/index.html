                    If you're stuck at home during some of the festivities over the next few weeks, don't fret entirely. Yes, you'll miss out on TONS of great events, but the good news is you can catch a few things remotely.
To that end there's a new Yaletown web camera that's now operational that gives views to the North and South. Tomorrow you'll be able to see the Torch Relay go through that area by watching on the web cam.
The webcam is sponsored by Wasserman + Partners Advertising, and can be viewed here (the links to activate it are in the top-right corner). Enjoy! ...

A New Day Begins In Vancouver
I took this photo at around 5am this morning. Watching the sun rise or the sun set is something I will never tire of. Seeing the orange-red glow stretch across the horizon always makes me think what a beautiful thing it is to be alive, and what an amazing part of the world I live in.

There are some people who think sunsets are cliche, and that taking photos of them is a waste of time. But I think the complete opposite, and as long as I have a camera, there will always be a sunset or a sunrise worth taking a photo of.

                    A few days ago I started getting a soreness in my throat and lungs that has since progressed into what I figured was bronchitis. I hit the medical clinic in Yaletown tonight and got a full check-up, and sure enough, it's what I thought it was. They've prescribed Zithromax, which should hopefully have me feeling a lot better in a day or two.
After filling my prescription on Pacific, I decided to check out a new coffee shop that opened up there. The coffee shop is Waves Coffee, and it's a quaint little spot right on the West Side of Yaletown. It reminded me a lot of the coffee shops I used to spend ...

                    I actually took this shot about a year ago, but I felt like posting a photo today and stumbled across this one. I took it from my patio first thing one spring morning. It's a three shot HDR with a bit of post processing.

Enjoy. ...

                    After I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, I decided that for the first time in a long time, I wanted to live relatively close to work. Some people argue that if you had to choose, you should always choose to live where you play (as opposed to living where you work). But, I spent the last few years having nearly an hour commute in each direction to go to work, and I was just sick of it.
So, I found a place downtown, and here I am, after nearly two years. I have a pretty sweet deal down here - I pay $1200 for an 800 sq. ft. apartment about 20 steps from the water, in a relatively nice area of downtown. ...

                    I've been messing around a bit more with photoshop in the evenings, and one day soon I'll read the huge 1000 page book I have on it as well. Here's something I was messing with a bit last night. It's a shot from my patio looking easy towards Yaletown. The bridge is the Granville Street Bridge.

The whole image involved work on about 5 different layers in photoshop. The rain was a bit trickier than I imagined, and it's not entirely convincing, but it's a good start. ...

                    Did a quick HDR off my patio before bed. And before I drop off, here's one more bit of info -- my dad and step-mom are getting on a plane at 7am to spend a week near Cancun relaxing. They usually spend most vacations every year in the RV camping somewhere, and this is the first trip that they've taken to a far-away place (except of course when they came to visit me out in Ottawa). So, I hope they have a really awesome time down there.

Also, Jari and Seppo should be stepping off a plane any time soon to spend the week up here in Vancouver. These are the two Finnish guys I got loaded with during ...
