                The last time I was in Brazil, I was there from June until August in 2013, which was basically the tail-end of their winter. The weather was actually quite nice (compared to a Canadian winter), with most days hovering around 20C. But I haven't experienced summer in South America since my first trip to Argentina in 2011.
Given that it's been snowing and below zero here in Hamilton for the last two weeks, seeing the sun again and 30C days is going to be a great change. I'm flying out of Pearson in the early afternoon on Wednesday, with a brief 4-hour stop over in New York City. I found a flight ...

I'm currently down in S達o Paulo, Brazil, living with my girlfriend Luciana in her apartment in Vila Leopoldina. The original plan was to spend two or three months here exploring Sao Paulo, and then eventually head to Europe to continue on with our travel adventures.
Our plans have changed somewhat though in that Luciana is now able to travel sooner than she would have originally been able to. So we've decided to accelerate our plans slightly, first by heading on a trip to Machu Picchu tomorrow, and second by heading to Europe in just a few weeks.
I'll be heading back to Canada on August 8th ...

                One of the hardest parts of traveling to remote countries is that it is not always easy to find some of the foods you enjoy the most back home. That in itself presents a great opportunity for exploring new foods, but let's face it: sometimes it's nice to have some tried and true comfort food.
 Homemade Salsa
A good example of that for me is mexican food. It's probably my favourite cuisine, and it was pretty rare that we didn't have tacos at least weekly in my household growing up.
Unfortunately in many parts of the world I've been in, finding mexican salsa can be a real pain. Even if you can find ...

                Last weekend I flew up to Puerto Iguazu to check out some of the most impressive waterfalls in the world, Iguazu Falls. Here is a breakdown of my visit to Iguazu Falls in South America.
Flight From Buenos Aires To Puerto Iguazu
I booked a flight on LAN airlines from Buenos Aires to Puerto Iguazu. Round trip airfare on the weekend is roughly $380 CAD, but thanks to some points on my credit card I managed to get about $300 off, ultimately costing me only $80 or so.
Unlike most international flights, domestic flights within Argentina usually leave from the Aeroparque Jorge Newbury, which is a small ...

                I've spent the last month taking in the sites in Buenos Aires, and am now starting to make plans for viewing a few sites outside of the city. The first location I'm probably going to visit is Iguazu Falls. If you are planning a trip to Iguazu Falls, then this post is for you.
Iguazu Falls
Iguazu Falls is a massive set of cascading waterfalls right on the border between Argentina and Brazil. People who have seen them say it's one of the most impressive natural wonders in the world, and it's something I've been anxiously awaiting for since I found out about them approximately six months ago.

                For the most part, I'll be spending the majority of my time in Argentina around the city of Buenos Aires. While there, I plan to sample as much culture as possible, and hopefully spend some of my down time getting private Spanish lessons.
Near the end of my time in Argentina though, I'm hoping to take a week or two off and actually do a bit of exploring around the country. One of the attractions I've been told to not miss is Iguazu Falls, which is located right on border between Brazil and Argentina.

It's quite the trek from Buenos Aires to the border of Brazil, and I'll probably have to take ...
