                    So, I'm sitting here camping, and trying to figure out just why it is that most cute girls ultimately end up dating complete Douche Bags. It's almost universal to be honest, and while there are exceptions to the rule obviously, it's something that I've never entirely understood.
A friend of mine actually just got into a new relationship, and I'm pretty sure the guy ranks a nine or a ten on the Douche Bag Scale. It's so obvious to me in fact that I really don't understand how she possibly can't see it. Interestingly enough, the last guy she dated was wearing a t-shirt that said "looking for a meaningful ...

                    This is always a really great topic to bring up at the table after everyone has been drinking for hours. I obviously have my own opinions on this subject, but I thought it would be a fun one to bring out here.
Given that a lot of people nowadays use Lavalife or one of the many other varieties of online dating services, what is the general opinion with regards to the guy picking up the bill on the first date? If you're a guy, is that cool with you? If you're a girl, would you pay your own portion? I know lots of girls who would openly admit they wouldn't go out on a second date without the guy ...

                    I saw this personal ad on craigslist tonight. This basically represents the type of ads I've grown accustomed to reading over the last year:

I am an attractive woman so I deserve the best. He must be tall, athletic, and educated. He must be successful,drive a nice vehicle, live on his own (no roomates) and be on his way to owning his own home soon. He must be generous. He must be willing to pamper me, indulge me, and treat me like a princess.I want a man who will take me for nice dinners and someone who likes to travel (with me).I don't mind if he has a busy schedual. I will make him happy in ...

                    So, this is the first blog entry I've written in quite some time while disconnected from the internet. I'm about 30 minutes out of San Francisco, somewhere around 40,000 feet. I feel like complete shit, and I'm really glad I decided to head back today instead of risking being down south and getting even sicker. A few minutes ago I had my head in my lap in pretty much unbearable pain -- turns out my right ear had some real problems adjusting to the change in pressure in the airplane, probably since I'm so congested right now. If I don't see some major changes in how I feel by tomorrow, I'm heading ...
