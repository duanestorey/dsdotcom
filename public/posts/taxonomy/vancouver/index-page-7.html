                So this afternoon I headed down to a little church in east Vancouver to shoot some photos for Vancouver fashion week. Thanks to Urban Vancouver I have been able to acquire a media pass so that I basically have full access at all these events (something that I didn't realize until today, since the pass I received today was exactly the same as the one I had on Thursday night).
Today was a mix of dresses and lingerie, and I had a really great time hanging out with some of the people I had met at th...

There are events all weekend, so make sure to check out their main web site if you are interested in seeing some local fashion. I just got an email saying I was on the guest list for the swim suit portion today, so I may hav...

                Normally I don't take breaks at work, at least not many long ones. In fact, I usually buy a small lunch and eat it at my desk, using that brief time to catch up on blogs are read the current news.
But yesterday, I suddenly got the urge to go outside and shoot some photos in the afternoon, so that's what I did. I didn't have my SLR, so I just shot with my point and shoot, which is always rather depressing. No matter - here are a couple shots of a surprisingly sunny Vancouver.

A friend sent me an email this morning which basically talks about Vancouver being chosen for a new Apple store.

After years of speculation and anticipation, there is finally confirmation that that an Apple store will occupy a space inside the Pacific Centre Mall in downtown Vancouver (BC). The three-block indoor mall has been undergoing a long-term and extensive renovation that included demolitio...

                Today I made the long trek to work, but instead of having my head down with my iPod firmly attached, I decided (mainly because my iPod was dead) to keep my head up and look around. Being a single guy, my gaze routinely fell on cute girls and, to my complete disappointment, nearly all of them had a cigarette firmly attached between their fingers.

                So, I called around this morning, and the first trickle of the Canon 40Ds are hitting stores.

I have my name on a wait list, and I'm pretty sure I'll get mine on Tuesday, should I still want it.

                I was just over at Rebecca's blog reading about "Free Hug Day" in Vancouver. I think it's a great idea, and I feel like I really need to do my part to help out.
So, for tomorrow only, I'd like to encourage all single girls to come up and give me a hug. I've been told I'm quite huggable, and it's the least I can do to help out with this great Vancouver event.

For some reason, it seems like more and more places I visit now are introducing "tipping" into the system. In particular, a lot of interact machines I encounter are starting to show "please enter tip amount."
In the old days, you'd usually encountered a "Tip: Yes/No" question first, but I've seen the former more and more lately, and it's starting to piss me off. You see, I don't think you should tip ...

The flight from Montreal to Vancouver, with the strong head winds, was almost six hours long - thankfully it was extremely bearable up in business class, thanks to my hot towel and my tasty meals.
