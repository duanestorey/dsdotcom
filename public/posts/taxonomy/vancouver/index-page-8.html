                I woke up this morning feeling even worse than I did when I went to bed last night, so I bit the bullet and changed my flight -- I'll be coming home later this evening. If I'm to get any more sick, I definitely want it to be back in Canada where I can hit a clinic up and not have to worry about costs or insurance. I'm pretty sure I have health insurance down here through my work insurance, but I can't imagine the hassle with trying to actually use it.

                I have a wedding to shoot in a few short months, so I've been asking friends if they'd let me shoot them to get some practice. Today I met up with John, Keira and Rebecca for a quick photo walk in the park. To be honest, after doing this shoot, I think I feel comfortable shooting outside now. I sort of always assumed my 70-200mm f/2.8L lens would be pretty useless in poor lighting or in a wedding environment, but when I used it today with my speedlight, it was actually pretty awesome.

                Last night I pulled my camera off the shelf, blew a layer of dust off of it, and headed down to gastown for a quick photowalk. Kris Krug has done a pretty stellar job of organizing these from time to time, and it's a good chance for people to get together, learn a few tricks, and hang out with good company.
We strolled around the tracks is Gastown, then made a loop around and came back through Blood Alley. Afterwards, we stopped at the Six Acres for some beers, and then eventually went to Kris' ...

Some people argue that if you had to choose, you should always choose to live where you play (as opposed to living where you work). But, I spent the last few years having nearly an hour commute in each direction to go to work, and I was just sick of it.
So, I found a place downtown, and here I am, after nearly two years. I have a pretty sweet deal down here - I pay...

                I've been experimenting with high dynamic range (HDR) images for a few months now, and so far I really love the effect that you can get with photos. At least in my eyes, HDR images generally seem to look a bit more natural than a typical shot that doesn't have a large dynamic range. Unfortunately, this whole field is more of an art than a science currently, so getting the perfect HDR shot is a bit of trial and error (and in a lot of cases, the end result isn't always appealing).

                Did a quick HDR off my patio before bed. And before I drop off, here's one more bit of info -- my dad and step-mom are getting on a plane at 7am to spend a week near Cancun relaxing. They usually spend most vacations every year in the RV camping somewhere, and this is the first trip that they've taken to a far-away place (except of course when they came to visit me out in Ottawa). So, I hope they have a really awesome time down there.

Also, Jari and Seppo should be stepping off a plane any time...

                So as the sun went down over downtown this evening, I thought it might be a neat idea to try and make a HDR panorama. I've done this a few times using my PC, but never using my new Macbook Pro. I took a series of 20 shots and merged them together using the Mac panorama software DoubleTake. Afterwards, I created the final HDR using Photomatix.
Here's the end result.

The HDR process went smoothly, but DoubleTake did a rather poor job of aligning the images. Part of the reason may have been that i...

                Neil, a friend of ours who we have worked with for the last three years or so, decided it was time to move on and has taken a new job in West Palm Beach, Florida. Last night we all got together at his place to have a few drinks and say goodbye to our pal.
Good luck Neil....
