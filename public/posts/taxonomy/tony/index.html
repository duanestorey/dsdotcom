                    Last week John Bollwitt sent me a Twitter message and asked if I wanted to come out to the Okanagan this weekend. John was asked to setup for a live radio broadcast out at a winery, and unfortunately Rebecca couldn't go with him. So, being the amazingly awesome friend that I am, I packed up my camera and hopped into John's company's mini-cooper.
It was a leisurely four hour drive from Chilliwack out to Osoyoos, and John and I just listened to music and got caught up. We basically just sat around and watched TV the first night, as we were both a bit beat from the drive.
The second day I basically ...

                    Unfortunately, there are very few people in this world nowadays who aren't full of shit. I have been around many blocks, and met many people, and I always end up (thankfully) back home with the same people I left with. That said, you do meet the odd person once and a while who is as good as his or her word.
Today (depending on when you read this) is Tony Pierce's birthday. I originally met Tony down at Matt's Las Vegas birthday party. I didn't get to spend a lot of time talking to him down there, but slowly, since then, have gotten to know Tony, and been privileged enough to drink the odd beer ...

                    Well, judging from the beer bottles all around me and the chinese food stain on the bed, I think I had a pile of fun last night. I did my best to keep track of how many beers I had via facebook, but it looks like I lost count at the end or had trouble counting.
I went with Raymi and Phil to the hospital when I arrived in the hotel since she hasn't been feeling that well. There they gave my a Christmas present, which included this cute little guy that plays the guitar (thanks guys, I'll post a photo later).

After that, Raymi and I started our nacho-fest with some down at Sneaky Dees.


We both ...

                    A few minutes ago, I took the last of the foul-tasting, side-effect inducing crud that I started nearly four weeks ago. The last few days have been particularly hard, and I've found myself extremely tired, have had a metallic taste in my mouth, and also a fairly bad migraine. While most of my family played board games tonight, I was forced to retire to the couch in the other room and attempt to out-sleep my pounding head.
