                I accidentally stumbled across the official Whitehouse Flickr account tonight, and was pretty enthralled by some of the photos in the account. First thing that's cool is that the Whitehouse even has a Flickr account. Second thing to take note of is that the photos are licensed with a creative commons attribution license, so basically you're free to use them in both commercial and non-commercial settings as long as you do proper attribution.

                I woke up to an email inviting me to a big Molson event down at the Burrard Street Brewery next week. It's an event geared towards some of Vancouver's web 2.0 saavy people and bloggers that involves sampling various beers as well as a special blogger brew that they have cooking up just for us.
It actually sounds like a ton of fun. Given that I can demolish a few beers without much effort, I think I'll definitely swing by and check it out. A few other of the night's attractions will be:

                So here's some food for thought for the blogosphere. Lately I've been pondering a few of the legal aspects of the Internet, namely what it is we are all allowed to do, and what it is some companies think we shouldn't be allowed to. Let me give you a use-case to demonstrate what I'm talking about.

                So, here's the deal. I really want to attend some of South by Southwest this year. The only problem is that all the hotels in Austin, Texas are pretty much sold out. I worked the phones for a bit tonight trying to find a place to crash, but haven't had any luck. So, a friend of mine told me to put something on my blog to see if any fish would bite.
So, is there anyone that has a floor or a couch they could possibly donate for a few days during South by Southwest this year in Austin, Texas. I'd h...

It's not like it caused me any headache or anything, but I just don't use it really at all anymore and don't have time to maintain that and my facebook account.

The closest event to this that I've been a part of was the unconference at Northern Voice back in February, which had a really great turn out.

His current brainchild is a service called Gaboogie which was designed in an attempt to simplify conference calls in the enterprise environment. Most conferenc...

One of the most interesting part of this conference, for me at least, is a glimpse into the nature of bloggers. The other night at the social, Lee LeFever gave a presentation...
