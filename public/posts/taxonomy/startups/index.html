                Ok, seriously. The things I would do if I had a few million bucks. I'm amazed to no end how many things about the internet kind of suck. Things that you'd think would be easy to fix, but for whatever reason nobody gets around to fixing them.
First company that I need to bash is YouTube. Seriously, Google buys you for 1.6 BILLION dollars and what's the first thing you do? Stick your head in the sand. How come there aren't any cool features, or you know, like standard features coming your way. Why...

                Last Friday I met a pile of people from the Vancouver technology scene down at the Lamplighter pub in Gastown. Apparently that location is surrounded in controversy, since the Lamplighter has recently changed hands and has been transformed into a more "modern" establishment. I can't say that I ever hung out in it before, but it seemed like a pretty cool place on Friday.
I would have shown up and mingled regardless, but on Friday I volunteered to drop by and take some photos of the Vancouver Tech...

                Tonight I went down to the Republic to partake in the second Launch Party. It's basically a mixer for technology enthusiasts, and an opportunity for a few startups to showcase their new products.

There were about 150 people that probably showed up, and it got rather tight and cramped at times, but it was cool meeting a lot of the people involved, and hanging out with a few old friends.

                Tomorrow night Tonight there is a Vancouver technology mixer down at the trendy night club Republic on Granville Street. I haven't been out to one of these in a long time, mainly because I've been feeling a bit under the weather for the last few months, but I think I'm going to check it out tomorrow.
Launch Party recently launched a new website, and if you look very, very closely, you may recognize the header image on it :)
So, hopefully I'll still feel like heading out tomorrow. I will be good ...

                When I first started my current job, the COO and one of the founders was a guy named Erik Lagerway. During the time he was at our company, we shared many a beer and even a plane ride or two together (the most memorable being the one to Phillidelphia where we got to witness first-hand drunken broomball in Horsham and Whatchamachukinchunk).
His current brainchild is a service called Gaboogie which was designed in an attempt to simplify conference calls in the enterprise environment. Most conferenc...
