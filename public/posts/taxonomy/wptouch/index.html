                    Two days ago we finally pulled the veil off of WPtouch Pro 3.0, the mobile plugin for WordPress, which is a fairly substantial update to WPtouch Pro. Most of my family and friends know just how hard we've been working on it over the last few months, and especially these last few weeks. Last night we had a little party with a few employees and some company friends, and today most of us finally get to relax a little.

The amount of effort we put into this launch we basically an order of magnitude larger than the one we did almost three years ago. As if it wasn't hard enough launching just a new ...

                    I'll do a big post about the launch of WPtouch Pro 3.0 in a few days, but for now all I'll say is that it has been a fairly massive undertaking that we started almost a full year ago.
We'll be revealing everything on Thursday, but for now everyone will have to make due with a quick teaser:

If you're interested in being notified when we launch in a few days, head on over to BraveNewCode.com and sign-up at the bottom. We're definitely looking forward to pulling back the veil and showing everyone what we've been working on for quite a while now.

                    I've been busy lately, busier in fact that I've been in quite some time. WPtouch 2.0 Pro has been a lot of work and a lot of fun, and we're getting ready to release it shortly. If you're interested in checking it out, sign up for updates.
WordCamp Vancouver is this weekend as well, and the last week especially has been a lot of work. The event is shaping up to be really great, so I'm definitely looking forward to being there. That said, I'm also looking forward to being on the other side of it so I can get back into my normal routine. With everything going on these last few weeks, I haven't really ...

                    We're getting pretty close to releasing WPtouch 2.0 soon. We haven't officially set a date, but the release will probably be counted using weeks, and can probably be counted using the fingers on one hand. We'll hopefully firm that up next week.
Dale wrote a pretty informative post over on BraveNewCode, so check it out. In short, we'll be releasing a very reasonably priced paid version that includes support first, then will eventually roll out another free version using the new codebase. The major addition to WPtouch 2.0 is a new theme framework for creating mobile themes. WPtouch 2.0 will also ...

Vision Critical was recently announced as the fastest growing company in British Columbia, and it was a lot of fun working with that team.
Today Dale and I woke up and starting seeing some press about the new mobile versions on WordPress.com. WordPress.com is the free, hosted version of the WordPress platform, and currently has around 5 million blogs or so on it I believe. As of today, the iPhone plugin for WordPress that Dale and I created, ...

                    As most people know, both WordPress and Drupal belong to the class of software known as content management systems (CMS). The benefit of these systems is that they allow users to create content easily, often by typing in content via a dashboard or some other simple form of entry. The actual HTML generation is taken care of by the CMS, allowing the user to focus on creating content without worrying about the details of the HTML.
I've had my personal blog for nearly ten years now, and have been on WordPress for nearly three. As I write content, there's always the implicit expectation that my content ...
