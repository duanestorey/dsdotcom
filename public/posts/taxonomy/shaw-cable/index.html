                    It's been over a month of me trying to get some resolution to my problems with my Internet at home, and I'm happy to say that I'm a step nearer today. I imagine it's due to everyone's help on Twitter to be honest, since a few people made a few calls internally on my behalf. So thanks if you helped out.
I got a call a while ago from someone within Shaw who was informed of my problems. Right away, she said she was going to make some price adjustments to reflect the fact that my service has been sub-par. First, she lowered my monthly internet fee from $45/mo down to $10/mo for a full year. Second, ...

                    Seriously. It's a massive slap in the face to be on hold for over an hour with a company while they're playing on-hold advertisements talking about how much better their customer service is than everyone else's.
My internet has been slowing down consistently month after month to the point where it's become nearly unusable. I'm paying for one of their higher end packages which is supposed to give up to 15 Mbps downstream and up to 1 Mbps downstream. Here's what it's been like for the last few weeks:

Right now I'm getting 4 Mbps downstream, and only 76 kbps upstream, with ping times of around 400ms ...

                    My friend Kelly sent me along this information, and I wanted to share it with everyone. Apparently Shaw Cable has been aggressively trying to hurt Novus in the Vancouver market. Here's some information from the 10buckstoo.com website:
Shaw has been offering residents in buildings wired for Novus wildly aggressive rates that itâ€™s not offering anyone else. This appears to be an attempt to eliminate Novus, its only local cable TV competition, which is unethical and unfair.
One of these offers is selling their Shaw Digital TV with:

Two months free
200 digital channels
$9.95/month for 10 months

                    I just got off the phone with Shaw Cable, and have finally completed my disconnection. I basically only watched 24 on TV, and now that it's over, I really can't justify paying $70/mo for it.
So, so long Shaw, and thanks for the memories.
To that end, I'm now selling the following:

Sony Progressive Scan DVD player with Remote 2) Shaw High Definition Digital Cable Box

My dad gets first dibs on #2, but if he doesn't want it, I'm open to offers before it goes on eBay. I paid $400 new for it, and $120 for the DVD player. ...

                    Nearly two years ago, I went out with my dad and step-mom and picked up a high-definition TV at future shop. Of course, having a high-definition TV without any sort of high-definition feed is rather pointless, so the first thing I did is pick up a HD cable box from Shaw. Unfortunately, I didn't realize at the time just how little TV I usually watch.
Between the HD cable option and my "high-speed" internet, I shell out around $110 a month, which is pretty stupid considering I watch only around one TV show a week if I'm lucky. So, I think tomorrow I'm going to call up shaw and finally cancel my ...
