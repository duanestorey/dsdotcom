                    So, I love WestJet as an airline. They are fun, funky, relatively cheap, and they fly out of Abbotsford, which is a way better location for me than Vancouver International Airport. That being said, their website doesn't support Safari on the Mac (possibly just Safari 4), which I think in this day and age provides a pretty poor user experience. Here's the notification you get when you fire up your browser:

First, I'm glad WestJet supports an ancient browser like IE, but given what a forward thinking company WestJet is, I'd really like to see support for some more modern browsers such as Safari. ...

                    I started messing around with some CSS3 stuff the other day and managed to add a web font to my site. As you can see, the title of every post is now rendered using a non web-safe font (at least if your browser supports CSS3 - right now I believe only Safari does). It's a bit premature, as many browsers do not support them, but I thought I'd start figuring out the tricks of tomorrow's trades.
It's just a bit of CSS magic, along with a true-type font on the server. The browser downloads the TTF and renders the titles using that font. I think it's a pretty cool new feature, and I am looking forward ...

                    For all of you people who upgraded to Leopard and are using GMail, you have have noticed a few weird things going on. For me, my contacts no longer auto complete properly, and periodically all the javascript in gmail stops working.
I've checked a lot of newsgroups and many people are having the same problems. Apparently gmail has tried moving to a newer version that isn't really compatible with Safari 3.0 yet. The solution is to just go up to the top right in gmail and click &quot;old version&quot;, which will roll back your GMail version to one that does work with Safari.
You're welcome :) ...

                    This is, unfortunately, my last full day at the resort. Tomorrow I get to wake up, pack my bags, and start the long journey back to Vancouver. While this place is really pretty amazing, I always get a bit excited whenever I get on a plane that's heading for home.

I get into Montreal tomorrow evening, and will be staying overnight in a nice hotel near the airport. While the rooms here are fairly nice, the beds are unanimously hard and I haven't had the best sleeps. Hopefully the bed in the Hilton is nice and soft so I can get a really great sleep tomorrow night.

                    To be honest, I'm not such a big fan of pre-arranged adventures at resorts. I've been on a few, and most of them are pretty basic and you kind of feel like it wasn't money well spent. However, I heard a lot of good things about the safari adventure, so I decided to check it out for the low price of $60 USD.
We left the resort at 9am, and proceeded to head into the lush Dominican Countryside. It was absolutely gorgeous, full of rolling hills, lush green vegetation, and a ton of friendly Dominican people. The safari jeep was loaded to the brim of soft drinks and booze, and nobody had an empty glass ...
