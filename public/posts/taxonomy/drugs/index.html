                You know, I'm pretty tired of hearing about Olympic scandals. I mean, so and so did drugs, what's his name did dope, and what's her name wasn't legal age to compete. It's hard to blame these athletes really, considering that the fireworks were faked for the broadcast, as was one of opening songs. I mean, there's corruption all across the board.
But you know, I think the penalties for the people caught doping are pretty loose. Sure, you might lose your medal after the fact, but some of them proba...

                Yes, it's true. Recent research says kids as young as eight years old can now safely go on cholesterol lowering medication!
Man, I can't believe they are seriously pushing that. Yes, overweight kids probably have high cholesterol, but let's focus on a solution, not a patch. Most people would probably be surprised to know that the whole science of cholesterol is pretty weak. Lots of people live their whole lives with high cholesterol and never experience any problems, and some people with low cho...

                I read this fairly alarming (although not entirely surprising) article yesterday detailing how prescription drugs are being detected in municipal water sources.

A vast array of pharmaceuticals -- including antibiotics, anti-convulsants, mood stabilizers and sex hormones -- have been found in the drinking water supplies of at least 41 million Americans, an Associated Press investigation shows. ..
â€¢ Officials in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said testing there discovered 56 pharmaceuticals or...

                By now I'm sure you've heard that Heath Ledger, one of the stars of the movie Brokeback Mountain, was found dead in NYC. While nobody really knows for sure what happened, police have said he was on both antidepressants and ambien, which is a relatively new form of sleeping pill that a few of my friends have taken from time to time for insomnia. Ambien by itself has a relatively good safety record, but when taken in combination with any other agent that has the ability to suppress the central ner...
