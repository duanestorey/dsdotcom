                    As we all know, the flux capacitor is what makes time travel possible. Blogathon, on the other hand, is made possibly by everyone's favorite stimulant, caffeine. And so this post is dedicated to caffeine in various forms.
I'm currently on my third coffee. I woke up and had a 7-11 coffee (because that's all I could find at 5:30am), then pounded back some coffee here at Workspace, and just picked up a new coffee from a little Gastown coffee shop called Lunas. I imagine I'll probably average a coffee every two hours or so, which would put me somewhere in the neighborhood of about 600 - 1200 mg of ...

Despite not really spending much time with them over the last ten years (mostly because I lived in a different city), I'm actually fairly close to both of them, and have really been enjoying my time with them since moving back to Chilliwack. Last night my niece gave me a phone call and told me about all of the boy crushes she had while at summer camp (count 'em people, 11 boy crushes).

                    One of the hobbies I have that brings me a lot of enjoyment is photography. It's something I've slowly honed and improved over the years to the point where I'm fairly comfortable with my camera, and with taking photos in most situations. Given how much enjoyment it's been to me, I thought I would periodically do the odd photo-entry for blogathon and talk a bit about the photos I share.

This shot of Kitsilano beach is one of the shots I'm most known for. It's currently used on the Kitsilano.ca website, and also in a few brochures. I was actually just randomly driving back from UBC one night, heading ...

                    Since I wrote in detail about Vancouver in my last post, it's only fitting that I talk a little bit about my current place of residence, Chilliwack. Chilliwack is a little farming community nestled between a mountain range, approximately 100 kms east of Vancouver. My apartment is probably only about 5 minutes from one of the nicest provincial parks in the province, complete with it's own picturesque lake:

I currently rent a 1200 square foot apartment for about $100 less a month than I was paying in Vancouver for my 700 square foot apartment. A new grocery store opened about two blocks away from ...

                    Vancouver is without a doubt one of the prettiest cities in the world, something that I appreciate more and more every time I go on a trip. In fact, I was just mentioning to a friend yesterday just how clean and inviting Vancouver is compared to most cities, specifically San Francisco and Los Angeles (both of which seem grubby and dirty by comparison, even though I happen to like aspects of both).

And while Vancouver is a pretty city, it is not without its problems. In fact, Vancouver's lower-east side is one of the poorest neighbourhoods in all of Canada, which is ironic given that it's about ...

I can't imagine many things worse in this world then being a parent and watching your child get sick. The BC Children's Hospital is known Canada wide for the work they do with children, which is why I've chosen it this year as my charity of choice.

In theory I should go easy on coffee today such that tonight I can have yet another decent sleep, so that's probably what I'll do.

In less than 48 hours Blogathon 2009 will officially kick off. Some people will be down at WorkSpace in Vancouver hanging out, and others will be congregating in the Valley somewhere. I still haven't decided where I'll end up, although I'm leaning towards the WorkSpace route, as it would be nice to hang out with some friends for the day, and cross the finish line as a group. Free Ice Cream is pretty rad too, so.

                    Last week I had the chance to talk to Paul Henderson of the Chilliwack Times regarding Blogathon. We ended up talking about various other items, including Facebook and Twitter, and some of my thoughts about the stuff I was doing over at InTheWack.com (which I need to update a bit more frequently).
Today the Chilliwack Times ran a story in the local paper, and it appears the online version is available here.
Just a couple of clarification points:

Last year Rebecca and I supported the Union Gospel Mission. This year she is supporting it (as well as others I'm sure). The caption in the photo seems ...

                    I've been approved on the official Blogathon website, which means people can actually start pledging for me now. Strangely enough, I've already received about $80 in pledges, several of which came in before I was approved on the website. They appear to be legit, but I can't for the life of me figure out where they came from.
But anyways, as I've pointed out in previous postings, I'll be supporting the BC Children's Hospital on July 25th. So if you'd like to support my efforts and the children at BC Children's Hospital, then please consider pledging. Thanks for the support! ...

                    This year's Blogathon takes place on July 25th, starting at 6am PDT. As most people know, last year I teamed up with Rebecca Bollwitt to help support the Union Gospel Mission in Vancouver. With some help from Matthew Good, the three of us raised around $8,000 I believe for Vancouver's homeless.
Without a doubt, Blogathon is an event that I wanted to be a part of this year. I briefly debated supporting a local Chilliwack charity, but given that I really don't know of many here, I decided not to go that route.
Lately I've found myself spending quite a bit of time with my niece and nephew. Thankfully, ...
