                    One of the hardest parts of working remotely and traveling is the need to find reliable internet from time to time. In some countries free internet is almost as ubiquitous as beer, and often advertised as prominently. But in some countries (I'm looking directly at you Australia and New Zealand) almost all the internet you will find in the wild is either time limited or bandwidth limited. It's not unusual to be in a coffee shop on only be given 10MB or so, which is hardly enough to check your email or Facebook feed.
The Solution

                    I pulled my laptop out of my case tonight and fired it up. I was immediately greeted with this:

$1000 worth of fail
As you can see, my LCD has a wicked crack in it. I did a quick scan in the forums, and replacing an LCD via the Apple store runs about $1000, which is rather insane. Thankfully I found a few companies on eBay that are selling the raw LCD screens for around $200, so I put in an order for a replacement. Hopefully I'll be able to install it myself when it comes in the mail.
So as of right now, I'm without a laptop. Thankfully I have an iMac at home as well, so I'm not really in any ...

                    The first order of business with my new iPhone is picking up a decent case to keep it from being scratched. I called around town, but unfortunately nobody has any stock for the 3G iPhone cases yet. So basically the only place left to buy one from was on Apple's store.
I originally went over with the intent to buy one case. However, it appears that one case wasn't enough to qualify me for free shipping. Since I like free stuff, I decided to buy a few more things. Since I wasn't sure if I'd like the first case, I bought a second one with a different style. Worst case, I'm sure somebody will probably ...

                    This morning I had the pleasure of swinging by MacStation in Yaletown on my way to work and picking up a brand new MacPro computer for work. I could sit here and quote technical specs until the cows came home, but I'll just say that this sucker completely rocks. It basically has two of everything:

Two CPUs, each of which has four 2.8 GHz cores
A dual-head video card capable of doing 1080p video on each port
Two network cards, so in theory you could put one on a private network and one on a public one

I've spent the last year sort of bouncing between multiple machines. In fact, looking back over ...

The writer was optimistic that the solid state drive would be a good investment. Unfortunately though, it provided rather lackluster performance, and hardly increased battery life at all. I've had my own Macbook Pro for a long time, and most of my friends have Macbook's. I'm purposefully holding off the Air because it looks ...

                    I've been using Leopard now for around 3 months, and to be honest, I'm really not impressed at all. It's an extremely buggy OS with a bunch of mediocre improvements, many of which I haven't really found a use for.
Spaces? I actually thought these would be cool, but I just haven't been able to find a good use for them. In fact, I find myself accidentally switching between spaces from time to time thanks to how heavily I rely on the control and option keys for other things.
Stacks is another completely useless feature, mainly because you can't really see enough icons. Plus, it's generally a stupid ...

I called down this afternoon and they said the LCD is toast on it which is why I've probably been having a pile of problems with sleep and things of that nature. A new one has been ordered and hopefully I can pick it up in a few days. It will be weird having a laptop again as I've gotten fairly used to using my desktop machine at home now.

I've checked a lot of newsgroups and many people are having the same problems. Apparently gmail has tried moving to a newer version that isn't really compatible with Safari 3.0 yet. The solution is to just go up to the top right in gmail and click "old version", which will roll back your GMail version to one that does work with Safari.

Then I remembered that I no longer have a laptop, as it's in for servicing. Which means I can leave my big bulky bag at home today. Which is weird, and honestly, sort of feels a bit freeing. I can walk to work today and actually just enjoy the nice sunny day with my iPod.

                    As everyone knows, I've spent the last six months battling my Macbook Pro. It's been plagued with various problems, the most severe of which lately is intermittent connectivity wherever I go. Not coming back whenever it sleeps it pretty lame too.
Anyways, I went to drop it off at the repair facility, and they said it would be gone for at least two weeks. So, being the impulsive buyer that I am, I decided to pick up an iMac for home. And to be honest, I used to always use a desktop computer, even though I had a Windows laptop before. But when I got my Mac, I ended up formatting my Windows machine ...

                    I know for a fact that Leopard seems to work fine with Apple's router, but I've been having a lot of problems with Leopard and my Linksys Wireless N router here at home. Once and a while it will just give itself a self-assigned IP address and that's that. The only way to fix it is to reboot my Mac and my router, which usually causes it to grab a real one. Funny thing is I can switch to my neighbours connection (sssh, don't tell), and it works fine even in that state, so it's something about the Linksys it doesn't like.
Seems like there's a problem with 10.5.1 and some wireless routers. Mine actually ...

                    Well, now that I've gotten all my weekend fun out of the way, I think I'm going to take it easy and relax. Of course, the first thing I'm going to do is warm up some left over lasagna, but then I have a bunch of web work I really want to get done. Plus, Sunday is usually laundry day, and I need to catch up on that.

I set up by Gmail/IMAP account on my Apple Mac Mail program. I'm not sure if I'm going to use it though. At least for me, it seems pretty slow. Not only does it seem to take forever to sync, but the CPU is fairly high even with the Mail program is idling. It might be related to the ...

                    About six months ago I got it into my head that I wanted to play around with RSS technology and see if I could come up with something cool with it. That eventually turned into a standalone RSS reader I wrote for the Mac called TrollDigger. The one feature everyone liked is the ability to view the actual pages instead of the RSS excerpts. I haven't touched it since then, and the version that's currently available for download is a bit clunky, but I was thinking about spending a few hours on it this weekend.
To be honest, lately I've been thinking about a completely GUI-less RSS reader. I'd like ...

                    I've been waiting patiently for this update, since I've had quite a few problems with wireless since switching to Leopard. I also need to drop my Mac off at the repair facility to probably replace the logic board in it, since I've been having weird LCD and sleep problems on my Mac. Unfortunately, there seems to be over a week delay at MacStation for even looking at these things, which means I'll basically be computerless for a while. I'm sure I'll survive, but will be weird not to have a computer at home. Maybe I can go back to doing "normal" things again for a while.
To get the new update, just ...

                    So, I know there are a bunch of programs available on the Mac for doing photo work and what not, but I'd like to ask everyone what they use on a daily basis. I have for the most part made due with iPhoto, but the organization capabilities of it suck, and I end up with directories full of photos without any real means to identify them. Unfortunately, I also need something with a relatively quick workflow (photoshop is too slow to use for me except in extreme cases).
Any recommendations? ...

                    So, I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but whatever. I've been messing in garage band for about six months now, wanting to record something but just not sure what to record. I used to be in choir over 20 years ago, and I can sort of carry a tune. I know I need to have a ton of practice to get anywhere close to where I used to be as a kid (and most of my practice was pre-puberty, so I have to re-learn a deeper voice), but I decided to get over the hump and just quickly record something and take my beats for it.
