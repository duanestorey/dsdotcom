                    I've been working on revamping this website for about six weeks now. I've actually never really had a proper logo or header on any of my personal sites, and used to simply creatively use a few fonts to achieve some kind of clickable header.
It was a bit ghetto, but it worked.
Given that I enjoy travelling and writing about my experiences, I decided over a month ago that I needed to make this site a bit more professional and also focus the content a bit better. If you've been following along, you've noticed incremental updates over the past few weeks.
The logo was commissioned about six months ...

                    I started playing with a new look and feel for my blog last week, and finished most of it off tonight. I had hacked my other one quite a few times and ended up breaking a few things on it. Hopefully this one will stay lean and mean a little while longer.
I still have to fix up the content on many of the subpages, but the main pages should be working mostly. I'm also going to be modifying the content to reflect my move out to Chilliwack in a few weeks, and of course going full time with BraveNewCode.
I have a few more ideas with regards to showing images and what not, but this is a pretty good ...

                    As most people know, both WordPress and Drupal belong to the class of software known as content management systems (CMS). The benefit of these systems is that they allow users to create content easily, often by typing in content via a dashboard or some other simple form of entry. The actual HTML generation is taken care of by the CMS, allowing the user to focus on creating content without worrying about the details of the HTML.
I've had my personal blog for nearly ten years now, and have been on WordPress for nearly three. As I write content, there's always the implicit expectation that my content ...

                    Well, this is interesting. I gave a few individuals an alpha version of the Viper Cache plugin I've been working on. It has just been reviewed on Anieto2k, one of the largest plugin sites. The author compared it against all the Wordpress plugins available today for caching. The full write-up is available here.
The article looks like it is in Spanish so you'll just have to settle for the pictures. Based on a few guesses in the translation, it looks like Viper Cache is the lowest in memory out of all four, and allows around 1330 pages per second on the test machine compared to the second place runner ...

                    As you can plainly see, I spent some time updating my blog theme the other day. One of the main problems whenever anyone does any web development is still unfortunately in the area of supporting multiple browsers. Usually a design that at first looks good in your development browser might look a bit weird in IE or another one.
It takes a lot of effort sometimes to make a site work in multiple browsers, something that should not be lost on those who visit sites frequently. For the most part, I'm lazy in this area. I generally target Sarfari and Firefox, and just sort of pray that it works in IE7 ...
