                    World travel is one of those things that most people think is completely unaffordable, at least until retirement. If you ask most people what they wish they were doing other than working, a lot of them almost always say they wish they were traveling and seeing some of the world. Part of the reason I think that travel is so appealing is that it represents a form of constant excitement. Let's be honest, while many people like their jobs, jobs by definition involve doing work, and work isn't always fun.
Money is probably the least constraining barrier to travel for me, mainly because I have a bit ...

                    For the most part, I'll be spending the majority of my time in Argentina around the city of Buenos Aires. While there, I plan to sample as much culture as possible, and hopefully spend some of my down time getting private Spanish lessons.
Near the end of my time in Argentina though, I'm hoping to take a week or two off and actually do a bit of exploring around the country. One of the attractions I've been told to not miss is Iguazu Falls, which is located right on border between Brazil and Argentina.

It's quite the trek from Buenos Aires to the border of Brazil, and I'll probably have to take ...

                    Well, according to my little Excel spreadsheet, my trip begins in 96 days now. Depending on whether or not you’re a glass is half full or half empty kind of person, that will seem like a lot of time or not very much. It doesn’t seem like very much time to me, considering how much I need to still do before taking off.

First, I gave notice on my apartment the other day. My landlord confirmed it today, which basically means the clock is ticking on this place. I’ve been waiting for October to officially arrive before starting the mad craigslist dash to sell pretty much everything that isn’t ...

This morning I put a deposit down on a nice apartment right in the heart of the trendy area in Buenos Aires, Palermo Soho. Soho, of course, is a reference to a hip, upbeat area in New York City.
Given that I'm only staying for three months, I thought I would spend my time in the cool part of the city. Palmero Soho is extremely green, with lots of parks and trees. In addition, it's also full of great restaurants, pubs, patios, and shopping.
In Buenos Aires it's next to impossible to get a super cheap apartment unless you have a local guarantor. That said, the place I'm renting is a pretty good ...
