                One of my main strategies for earning free airline travel that I discuss in my eBook is leveraging a travel rewards card. For most people simply using a travel reward card for day-to-day purchases is enough to earn a free vacation each and every year. I've been using a few different cards for three years now, and I've earned a full return trip to Machu Picchu in Peru, a free return trip to Auckland, New Zealand, and enough for another trans-continental trip already accumulated. And all I had to ...

                I've been a 'world traveler' for almost two and a half years now. Back then I hadn't really been away from Canada for very long before, and the thought of spending multiple weeks, let alone multiple months, in a foreign country was a pretty strange idea.

Now the idea of loading a backpack up and heading to a new country feels about as foreign to me as doing a load of laundry. If I saw a plane ticket somewhere for a good price, I could probably be at the airport in three hours, ready to go on a ...

                So last month when I was in eastern Europe I saw that Square released their Square credit card reader that plugs into the headphone jack on iOS devices and can be used in Canada. Apple has always had a mobile credit card system at their Apple stores, but it's something that's been harder to obtain for the rest of us. I look at this type of device as a potential game-changer, since it essentially puts commerce into all of our pockets.
I have quite a few friends that have written books - now they ...

                One of the hard parts of traveling around is deciding what to bring with you and what to leave behind. That's relevant before your adventures, and it's also relevant while you're traveling.
Despite Buenos Aires having a relatively high petty crime rate, I spent my first week and a half here walking around with my wallet in my back pocket and basically every piece of ID and financial card in there as well. It wasn't until I lost my bank card a few days later that I started to really think about t...

                I ran across this article this morning about credit card debt, and started trying to figure out what it meant in terms of numbers.

Nearly 80 percent of American families have at least one credit card, 44 percent of families carry a balance on their credit cards, and Americans pay about $15 billion a year in penalty fees, according to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's office.

The current population in the US is around 305 million (2008 census). I don't know how many families are in the US, but ...
