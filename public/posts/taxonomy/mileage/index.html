                    I started my long-term travel adventures in January of 2011, almost 2.5 years ago. Looking back, I really had no idea how the airline systems worked: I wasn't really collecting any sort of air-miles, didn't know how to fly for free, nor was I trying to get to any type of elite status (I didn't even really know how to be honest).

Almost all airlines have some type of frequent flyer program designed to reward individuals who fly their airline repeatedly. While I've collected them periodically, I've never really obtained anything substantial using my accumulated frequent flyer milage.
When I set out on my adventure back in January of 2011, I had a goal in the back of my mind to finally achieve some type of elite status on an airline this year or the next. I have worked with many business people who had either silver or gold elite status, and I imagine bypassing a huge lineup or getting the odd free flight is a pretty great ...
