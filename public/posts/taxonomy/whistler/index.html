                As most people on Twitter now know, a dogsledding company in Whistler has recently admitted that it killed 100 of its dogs after demand was less than anticipated after the winter olympics. Instead of euthanizing these animals, allegedly some employee was given the task of killing these animals one by one and then burying them, some apparently while still alive.
Obviously this act is causing a lot of people to be upset. I personally think it's an extreme form of cruelty, and that the company and people involved should be punished. These animals should have been offered up to others, or at the very ...

                I read an article this morning that basically made me feel bad for being against the Olympics at this stage in the game. It was written by a participant in the games, one who is disappointed with the lack of support in this province:

With a blunt and harsh realization that not everyone with a Canadian passport is brimming over with excitement and anticipation for the sixteen day event in February, I must admit that my bright and shiny optimism has turned a murky shade of grey.
Not because sliding hasn't been great - it's been fantastic. I feel in top form on my sled, I am in my best physical ...

                Well, here we are. It's been a long time coming, but WordCamp Portland is finally here. I spent most of yesterday traveling, mainly due to the slowness of airlines, but ended up arriving around 6:30pm or so last night.
There was a dinner last night for the speakers and sponsors, and it was good to finally meet everyone involved in the event. The restaurant was Ethiopian, which you don't see too many of back in BC, so it was a great treat. Thanks to the dinner sponsor who picked up the food and drinks last night.

                As I'm pretty beat, I'll post in more detail about WordCamp Whistler over the next few days. But I wanted to just say that it was a really great success in my opinion, and for the most part, went off without any hitches. I want to thank John Bollwitt and Rebecca Bollwitt for all their hard work over the last two months to help make it possible. I also want to thank all of the sponsors, speakers, and of course, the attendees who came up and made it a success.

                Yes folks, in only six more days we'll be forced to close down registration for WordCamp Whistler so that we can give our final numbers to the Fairmont. Tickets are still available, so if you'd like to come, make sure you sign up now. Included in the price of a ticket is a full day of WordPress and social media related talks, lunch, a few drinks at the social event, and a piece of one-of-a-kind WordPress schwag.
The participants of WordCamp Whistler have also been extended an invite to a Beer For Bloggers event up in Whistler on Friday, the 23rd. So if you're up in Whistler by then, there are ...

                Don't have much time this morning, but I wanted to give a quick update. First off, I had a shower before I went to bed last night. Unfortunately, I left the floor a little bit wet, something I realized at around 4am when I went to the bathroom and complete wiped out. Somehow I busted my hand open trying to stop myself from falling, and I bruised my shoulder pretty bad. I woke up with dried blood on my hand this morning, so I must have whacked it pretty good.
This is my sixth last day of work, and then I'm done. I haven't even begun to think about packing yet, and probably won't get a chance to ...

We're hoping to nail down a venue in the next week or so, at which time we'll open up official registration. Given that we want to make the event as awesome and as interesting as possible, we're going to be charging a small admission for the event. In addition, we'll also be accepting sponsorship from a few organizations, which will hopefully cover the costs of the venue, and the social.
Stay tuned in the next week or so for some official announcements. As of now, the date is still set for January 24th, ...

                Yes, that's right people. How does going up to Whistler and spending a weekend boarding/skiing and talking about everyone's favourite blogging engine, WordPress, sound? I suggested this briefly on Twitter tonight, and immediately got a message from Rebecca along the lines of "hell ya!"

I emailed a hotel already tonight at the heart of the village to see what kind of group rates we could get in December or January. I think it would be awesome to go up for a weekend, hold a WordCamp during the day, and do afternoon/night skiing in the off time, or on the second day.

I've blogged about that fact before I'm sure, but now as I am about to throw away a $110 pair of Aldo shoes that didn't last six months, I am suddenly reminded of it. After the first two months, one of the soles came off. I told the guys at the store, and they just assumed I was way too hard on my shoes. So, I coughed up some cash and had the shoes fixed by a shoe-fixer guy. Two months later, same deal, except on the other side. So, I coughed up some more cash and had another shoe repair person fix the second one. Jump forward two months, and ...
