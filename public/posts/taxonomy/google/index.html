                Just for yucks, I integrated Google Latitude into the sidebar in my blog section. Google latitude, for those that don't know, allows people with GPS-enabled devices to share their locations with their friends (I think it can do it based on geo-IP as well, but that's not super exciting IMO). I'm not entirely sure showing a map with all my friends on it is particularly useful to be honest, but I thought I'd toss my location up on there for something to do.
Far better, in my opinion, would be integ...

                One of my major criticisms of Google over the last few years has been the state of most of their products. While many of them are initially innovative and useful, they usually fall by the way side and seemingly get abandoned. The "beta" moniker seems to be ever-present on most of their services, leading one to almost believe that there is no such thing as a finish product within the walls of Google.
I just read this article where someone took the time to figure out just how many of Google's prod...

                So, it's 30 minutes past midnight, and we just got back from another long day at Google. I'm sitting in Scott's 82 degree fahrenheit hotel room with Derek and twelve beers. Last night we realized that a 14 hour day would be a lot better if we had a few beers to finish it off, so we basically started the midnight-gas-station-beer-run tradition.

                I've been using Google Reader as my main RSS reader for some time. For the most part, I'm pretty happy with it. They've recently added the ability to share items, which makes it far more interesting.
The one thing I'd love to see though is the ability to add local comments on those shared items, comments that only my friends could see. So many times I've read items in my friends' shared feeds and really wanted to say something, or get clarification. Going to the real site and posting a comment s...

Lately I've been pondering a few of the legal aspects of the Internet, namely what it is we are all allowed to do, and what it is some companies think we shouldn't be allowed to. Let me give you a use-case to demonstrate what I'm talking about.

It appears Google now has a new analytics section where you can track internal searches on your blog.
