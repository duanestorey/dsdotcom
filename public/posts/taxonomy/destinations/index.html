                    As much as I love travelling to new places, you'll often hear me complaining about how much I dislike the process of travelling - the airports, customs line-ups, security line-ups, crappy airport food, turbulence, jet-lag and many more. For new travellers, these things are somewhat exciting in their own right, but after a while they grow old and tiring.
With that in mind, I was recently reading Anthony Bourdain's travel tips via a link on Facebook (most of which are great) and thought I would follow up with a point-by-point comparison of some of my tips.

The first thing I do is I dress for airports. ...

I'm only about a month away from leaving on my big adventure. First stop is obviously Buenos Aires, and then over to Ireland to drink one of these bad boys with Andy.
After that, I really have no plans, other than to hit Serbia sometime around July. I also have some family that's visiting China in August, so I may hit that as well.
So, if you were slowly making your way around the world, where would you go? What would you want to see? ...

                    I've been doing quite a bit of reading lately with regards to travel destinations. First and foremost are a few travel books I picked up last year, namely one on Montenegro. But I also have books on Eastern Europe and various city destinations such as New York City.
Reading them though one can't help but feel that a lot of what made these destinations unique has slowly eroded over time. For example, you'll find english speaking people in almost every city nowadays. I always like traveling to a remote destination and trying to speak in their language, but even on my trips I could always fall back ...
