                I'm down here in Punta Cana, drinking a few beers with my friend Dale. I saw on Twitter that my good friend Kasia is expecting her first child, and I wanted to share.

There aren't really too many aspects of my old job I miss, but Kasia is definitely one of them. Despite our best efforts, we haven't been able to meet for lunch or anything since I left my job in January, but hopefully sometime soon. That said, I'm super happy for Kasia and her husband, Rob, on their recent announcement.
I wish yo...

                Ahh yes.. Friday.. So exciting.. This was a really good week. I hung out with friends, got some stuff done in the office, and have a pile of fun things to do this weekend. After work I'm meeting up with Rebecca, Kasia and maybe Keira for some wings and beer. Life's rough I know. Plus on the way over I want to buy a flash diffuser over at Leo's Camera on Granville, something that I used at the last wedding I shot and wished I actually owned.
Tomorrow there are two parties, one for Rebecca's birth...

                There are some people who would say that getting excited about Christmas in November is a bit lame. And to them, I would say bah, humbug. Most of my best memories revolve around the Christmas season -- either friends in my university dorm sharing some eggnog (with rum of course), opening presents with my niece and nephew, or watching it snow in Ottawa from my festively-lit living room. I don't know why, but I just get excited when I start seeing lights up.
So tonight Kasia (a friend of mine who ...

                I'm always amazed how little liquor some people can handle. Me, it's pretty rare to get in a state where I feel like I've had too much.. But my pal Cisco -- It doesn't really take him a heck of a lot.
We had some beer with lunch today, and here are the results. I think you can rent him out for parties too....
