                    The plane ride was fairly uneventful. I haven't flown West Jet for a while, but thankfully everyone on board still had a great sense of humour, and the flight was nice and smooth. I was pretty happy to see that new Harry Potter on the in flight entertainment, since I haven't had time to see it and I had really wanted to. On West Jet, you have to pay if you want to watch a movie, but I figure I can kill a paperback in about 4 hours or so, so paying $5 to watch a movie isn't that bad a deal.
The rest of the time I spent messing around with my new iPod, and I have to say, that thing is really slick. ...

                    Last night I met up with John and Rebecca to watch the hockey game down at Fogg 'n Suds. I'm not super familiar with the Canucks line anymore, so being around super hockey Canucks people is a bit intimidating. That being said, I did manage watch some of the game and to lose myself for a time in the high-ball fishbowls that they were serving there.

                    Slight change of plans. I was originally going to go to Toronto on the 26th, but I'm going to go to Ottawa the week before for work. So, I'll be bouncing into Toronto on the 26th, but instead of coming from Vancouver, I'll be coming in on a flight from Ottawa. That will put me into Toronto several hours earlier, which should take a bit of pressure off with having to get downtown from the airport.

I'll be staying out in Kanata in a really great hotel called The Brookstreet Hotel, which just happens to be owned by Terry Matthews (whose company recently merged with ours). Apparently Terry and/or ...

                    I nearly went into work today, but still felt a bit under the weather this morning and decided to rest a bit more. So tomorrow, I'm going to head into work and see if I can pull off a full day. I tried to go to the clinic tonight for a check-up, but there was over a two hour wait, so I'm going to try again in the morning on my way to work.
Also, this weekend I'll be attending Mike and Kim's wedding as the primary photographer, which is both exciting and a bit stressful. It's not hard to grab a camera and take a bunch of photos, but it is hard to be prepared, both technically and mentally, for ...

                    On Friday, I met up briefly with Rebecca down at the Six Acres in Gastown for a few drinks on a patio. It was a good way to start a Friday afternoon, and since I had only woken up a few hours prior, I was definitely in the mood to drink and grab something to eat. Afterwards, we went down to the west-end for some pizza, and to hang out with John, who was busy playing with Dave Olsen's new microphone on his computer.
A bunch of my new blogger-type friends (most of which I originally ran into down at Northern Voice) were down at DemoCamp the other day, but unfortunately I wasn't feeling up to venturing ...

                    First, I just want to say how bad Aldo shoes suck. I've blogged about that fact before I'm sure, but now as I am about to throw away a $110 pair of Aldo shoes that didn't last six months, I am suddenly reminded of it. After the first two months, one of the soles came off. I told the guys at the store, and they just assumed I was way too hard on my shoes. So, I coughed up some cash and had the shoes fixed by a shoe-fixer guy. Two months later, same deal, except on the other side. So, I coughed up some more cash and had another shoe repair person fix the second one. Jump forward two months, and ...

                    Yesterday, partly by chance, and later by design, I found that I didn't log into an IM client for nearly the entire day. No Jabber, no Yahoo, no Windows Live or whatever they are calling it now -- just me, alone with my machine.
And it was everything that I thought it would be.
Now let me just tell you what a typical day is like for me on IM. I have, quite easily, well over 100 people on my IM client. A small percentage of these are personal (friends and family), but without a doubt, the majority are business related. During a typical work day, I'd say 70 of them or so are online and working in ...

                    So I have a few minutes to kill here at Heathrow, so I thought I would write a quick blog entry. The flight from Vancouver to here was relatively uneventful. The guy next to me was sort of a prick, and unfortunately for me I don't think he brushed his teeth yesterday, but I survived. I haven't slept a wink, so I'm hoping I can sleep for an hour or two on the next flight to Helsinki. I think my next flight is delayed slightly, which means I probably won't get into the hotel until around 10pm or so. One thing is for certain -- I'm definitely going to be ready to have a nice long sleep when I get ...
