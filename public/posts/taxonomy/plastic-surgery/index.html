                    It's been nearly four weeks now since I had some minor surgery on my face. For those of you following along, I made a decision a few months ago to have a few moles removed from my face. As a kid, they were awesome beauty marks that made me the envy of the playground, but as I got older, they had slowly increased in size to the point where they were interfering with shaving and what-not. Two of them were fairly flat, but the one on my cheek was raised slightly, and would get nicked from time to time by my razor (at which point I'd spend the next few hours trying to get it to stop bleeding). The ...

                    A few weeks ago I blogged about an upcoming appointment to have a few moles removed from my face (the main reason being that I keep cutting them while shaving). Well, today was the day, and they're officially gone.
Strangely enough, I've developed a bit of a fainting reaction over the years to needles. That's weird because needles don't scare me in the least, and for the most part, I have a pretty high pain tolerance. But there's something about a needle being stuck in me that elicits some kind of physiological reaction, almost like my body knows something else is coming, and tries to shut down. ...

                    I have an appointment on Wednesday to get a few moles removed from my face. I've had them most of my life, and for the most part they haven't really bothered me. That being said, this last year I've found myself cutting two of them while shaving from time to time, which usually results in them bleeding for hours at a time (real attractive, I know).

You can see two of them in this photo. The first is the one on my right cheek, and the second is the one on my left upper-lip. The third one is really tiny, and it's in the center of my lip (I don't cut it shaving, but I figure I might as well get ...

                    On Wednesday, I'll get to meet Dr. Peter Dolman, who is one of the best ocuplastics surgeons in the country. I've been on the wait list for about three months now, and I really have no idea what to expect to be honest. I went to the extra trouble to try and make sure my CT and MRI scans were there waiting for him, but I suspect that somehow they will have been lost come Wednesday, and we'll have nothing to talk about.
Truth is, I really don't know what the end result will be. Tonight I told some friends that it's really a lose-lose at this point, which is true from my perspective. Option one is ...
