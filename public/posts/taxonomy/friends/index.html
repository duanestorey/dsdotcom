                Rebecca Bollwitt is one of those rare people who doesn't need an introduction. Her Vancouver blog, Miss604.com, is well known in Canada and parts of the United States, and has been voted the #1 Vancouver blog for the last four years. Rebecca has organized several conferences in the Vancouver area, including two WordCamps, several Twestivals, and several blog-until-you-pass-out 24-hour sessions of Blogathons.
Not only is Rebecca actively involved with Vancouver and her website, but her and her hu...

I had an opportunity the other day to record an hour long podcast with my friend John Biehler. John recently started a technology-based podcast called TekEh that has a particular emphasis on Canadian content and guests.
His first episode was Kemp Edwards from HootSuite, and talked mainly about the experiences of being in Austin, Texas for South by Southwest.
I was excited to be the second guest in the series, and spent an hour sipping a rum and coke and talking about WordPress, our experiences ...

                Another year is almost upon us, and I thought a final post was in order. It was definitely an interesting year for me, the highlight (at a personal level) probably being a third surgery on my eye socket (which I was told four years ago wasn't possible). But I also did a fair bit of traveling, and I thought a little photo-finish finale was in order for 2012.

                I left Vancouver approximately five weeks ago, and headed for Malta via Paris. My ultimate goal was to end up in Serbia, but I thought I would stop and visit two friends of mine that I met in Kuala Lumpur last year: Krisztina and Debbie. Here's a summary of my one-week visit to Malta.
Despite all the travel I do, I actually really hate flying, and would say I have a mild phobia. To counteract that, I usually have a bottle of Ativan (anti-anxiety medication) with me on the plane. For short haul f...

                In just a few days I'll be leaving for the city of Buenos Aires again. As people who read this blog know, I started off this great travel adventure of mine last year in that very city. At the time I was a pretty green traveler, and struggled with the language and figuring out how the city worked for the first month or so of my trip. I was frustrated a few times, and a little disheartened with how hard it was at first to meet people. But I eventually overcame most of those obstacles, and probably...

                In the fall of 2010, I decided I wanted to set out on a big travel adventure. At the time I had become a bit bored of life in Chilliwack, and wanted to take advantage of the fact that I can work anywhere with an internet connection and actually see some of the world. I sold most of my furniture at the time and put the rest into a storage locker. And almost exactly a year ago, I boarded a plane and headed to South America.

I spent approximately eight months of this past year living out of a suit...

                Last summer I was sitting in a rented room in Vancouver, trying to decide where I was going to go next on my little adventure. I had always had New Zealand at the top of my list, but given how it was winter in the southern hemisphere, I needed to come up with a plan that didn't involve freezing to death. After all, I am a migratory nerd, so I should probably follow the sunshine.

That's when my friends, Scott and Sam, contacted me and said they were going to be in Thailand for a few months and t...

                I made it!
After nearly 18 hours of flying, I finally landed in Koh Samui a few days ago. My friends Scott and Samantha had an airport shuttle booked for me, so I simply got in the shuttle after landing and headed down to my new apartment here.
The place I'm renting is about a 10 minute walk from the beach, but it's in a new complex with a pool, internet, maid service (for $5 a pop), and air conditioning. Normally these units run for about 21,000 Baht/mo (around $700 CAD), but because we were re...

                I'm down to 12 days until I leave to Thailand, and it's definitely fast approaching. My friends Scott and Samantha leave tomorrow, so I'll get to starting watching their Facebook stream in the next few days to see my first glimpses of Thailand.

I spent the last few days camping up at Cultus Lake, which is one of my favourite summer activities. It was pretty much perfect weather, other than being a tad cold at night, and was really enjoyable and relaxing. I have all my camping gear in my car rig...

                If there is one person in particular who has inspired my travels to date, it would be Scott Hadfield. Scott discovered he had the ability to work remotely years ago, and left to go explore the world while still working for a North American company. He would show up in Vancouver from time to time, but mostly he was working remotely in Buenos Aires or South Africa.
I was recently planning a trip to New Zealand for the fall when Scott and his wife Samantha informed me they were going to be having a...

                One of the main reasons I came back from my last trip was to take a bit of a breather in BC for a few months, and also to enjoy a bit of time camping in the outdoors. I've managed to do both since arriving back at the end of April, and so it's time to start thinking about moving on again.
I quite liked escaping some of Vancouver's dreary rainy/cold season last year in Argentina, and I thought I would head to the southern hemisphere again this year. With that in mind, I've been thinking about New...

                This last weekend my friend Dave and I made a hasty escape from the city and headed towards Pemberton. I ad a pretty rough prior week, as did Dave, so we were both looking to get away for a few days and simply enjoy some time in the outdoors.
The place we ended up going to is called Owl Creek, and it's a small campground about 15 minutes past Pemberton, BC. Usually when I'm up in that neck of the woods I head on up to Birkenhead Lake, but Owl Creek is about 40 minutes closer from Vancouver, and ...

As many people know, I spent the last four months bouncing between South America and Europe. It was a fun time, and I met a pile of great people over the course of my trip.
One such person is Stella Maris, who lives just outside of Sao Paulo, Brazil. I was at a random pub in Buenos Aires called "Sugar" when I ran into Stella and her cousin. I was a few sheets to the wind, so I honestly don't remember too much that night, other than meeting up with them. But thankfully I've kept in touch with St...

                As many people on Twitter know, after four months of traveling I am finally back at home in BC. I was originally going to fly back home on Thursday, but the combination of a friend of mine having a death in the family back home and the fact that I found a really cheap flight leaving Dublin on Sunday made me decide to head back a few days early.
Sunday was a long day: I had an eight hour flight from Dublin to Chicago, a five hour layover, and then another four and a half hour flight to Vancouver....

                I left South America a few weeks ago, and have since been to New York City and a great deal of Ireland.
Ireland was quite the whirlwind adventure. I spent the first night in Limerick at my friend Andy's place, and then the next day we did a road trip up to Galway. The day after we headed down to Cork, and made a quick pitstop to kiss the original Blarney Stone. The next two nights we stayed at little 200 year old cottage in Mitchellstown. All in all a great adventure. I flew to Edinburgh, Scotla...

                I've been going pretty much non-stop since last Wednesday. It's hard for me to believe that less than a week ago I was sitting in the airport in Buenos Aires getting ready to leave. Since then I've flown for 15 hours, been molested in Houston airport, and spent five days bouncing around New York City with my friend.
Leaving Buenos Aires
Before leaving Canada I managed to pick up a prescription of Ativan to help with airplane anxiety. I actually have a mild-phobia of hurtling through the atmosphe...

                Six months ago I was sitting back in my apartment in Chilliwack trying to figure out where the first destination on my big adventure would take me. I immediately thought of the Caribbean, since it was an area I had been to many times and I was familiar with. Since the goal of my trip was to also work while exploring the world, that meant wherever I ended up would have to have decent access to the internet. That took Cuba off the list, as well as most small towns. I was actually homing in on the ...

                Last night a few of us went down to check out a little party on a boat docked in Puerto Madero. Puerto Madero is the area on the east of Buenos Aires that is one of the newest, trendiest (also, more expensive) areas within Buenos Aires, and is home to a lot of skyscrapers, one of which houses Microsoft's offices here.
It was the first time I hazarded to take my DSLR out in public, and I'm really glad I did. Truthfully, it's been great getting back into photography, since I essentially took a few...

                Traveling the world for leisure is obviously a great adventure. While I get to enjoy the weekends and the evenings, I'm also working as I travel, so most of my days are spent building plugins for WordPress and helping keep things afloat. But I do get to venture out from time to time free of computers and cell phones and enjoy some of what the world has to offer, for example, this weekend's trip to the famous Iguazu Falls.

But other types of travel are for more nobler causes. As an example, a go...

                Well, given that it's already Christmas in some parts of the world, I wanted to write a quick post and wish a very Merry Christmas to everyone. I hope the next day or two for everyone are spent in the company of family and friends, surrounding by love and laughter.
Yesterday we had Christmas over at my dad's house, and today I'm heading over to have a mini-Christmas at my sister's house. Tomorrow I head over to my mom's house for dinner with that side of the family, and then Christmas is done fo...
