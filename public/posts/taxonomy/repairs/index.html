                    It seems like I spend a lot of time at the Apple store trying to get things fixed. My current laptop has had the LCD replaced, and the main board twice now. My previous laptop also spent a few visits behind closed doors there as well. Truth be told, in the shower today I was trying to think of any other devices I've ever owned that have been in for repair as often, and I can't think of any. I've had each of my cameras in once to the shop, once to repair a cracked LCD (I dropped it), and once for a cleaning. So other than when I drop things or get them dirty, not many of my devices crap out on ...

                    I actually hit the sack before midnight last night, which is pretty much an unprecedented event in my life. The main reason was because I had to get up early and take my car into the shop to get some TLC.
While on my road trip a few weeks ago, a few things suddenly stopped working, including the door lock switch on the driver's side door, the CD player (it currently does a better job grinding CDs then it does playing them), and a small problem with my gear shifter.
