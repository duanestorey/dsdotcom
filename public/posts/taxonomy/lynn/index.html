                    Yesterday I went down to Friday Harbor and hung out with my friend Lynn. I hadn't been to Friday Harbor since I was about 17 or so, so it was definitely cool to go back. There wasn't as much there to do as I thought there would be, but Lynn and I managed to find a few watering holes to hang out in and observe the locals for a while. "Chap-man" pretty much took the weirdo cake, but there were lots of runners up. It was great catching up with Lynn again too, since we hadn't had a chance to hang out for over two years now. In addition, the weather was nearly perfect, and reminded me of a nice warm ...

                    I'm pretty close to wrapping up a few projects here, so much so that I'm half packed already for my upcoming road trip. Until this afternoon, I hadn't really decided what I was going to do for a little break, but after talking to a few people, decided to hit the open road and see where it takes me. It's more of a working vacation to be honest, as I still have a few client projects to do, but I plan to do them from beside the pool at a KOA, or little coffee shops near the ocean somewhere. I've been up and down the West Coast quite a few times now, so it's a drive I'm familiar with. But every trip ...

                    Turns out that my friend Lynn down in Seattle has had a blog for years and years, but for some reason I never knew about it until recently. It's actually a really good read, with quite a few personal entries as well. So if you're looking for some new reading material, definitely head on over and check it out. She'll probably kill me for posting this, but I like living dangerously, so.
Lynn was nice enough to send me some fruit flowers for my birthday years ago, and even though I'm not in Seattle very often we've kept in touch online (which is challenging, considering she doesn't use Facebook or ...

                    I had a really good time in Seattle last night. On my way back from my big walking adventure, I saw a pub called "The Blarney Stone" and basically had to stop by to have one drink out of honour of my home town. While sitting at the pub, I tried my first (and probably last) Strongbow beer. If you haven't had one, you definitely should at least once.. It sort of tastes like apple juice on steroids.
It was here that I ran into Sara and Alec and started my drinking adventure of the evening. I had made dinner plans with a friend around 8pm, so we did a pretty good job of drinking until then.. At that ...
