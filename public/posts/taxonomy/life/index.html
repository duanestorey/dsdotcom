                I realized recently that it's been almost a full year since I wrote anything on this website. I have tried at various times over the last year to sit down and write, but the words just wouldn't come. But tonight I thought it was probably best to blow the layer of dust off and finally write an update.
And the main update is this: last year my heart broke.

                Pretty good article I read today about the importance of slowing your life down. I think it's relevant since it's basically been the direction I've been taking my life for the last seven months.
Read the goods here. ...

This year I'm going to do something different with regards to the summer -- I'm going to keep all my weekends open for me. For the last three years, I have basically not really had any time in the summers to do the things I wanted. The summer of 2005 I spent in a small office in Burnaby with a bunch of other guys, literally working ...
