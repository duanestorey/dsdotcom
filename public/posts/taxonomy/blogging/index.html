                This is my first post in a long time, as you can tell. One of the reasons I'm writing 
an entry is due to what's been going on in the WordPress world. In case you've been living under a rock,
there is currently a big public battle going on between Matt Mullenweg, the company he runs, 'Automattic', and a rival 
called WP Engine.
I can only speculate as to the reasons for this public spat. On its surface, one side claims it's about a trademark dispute. But based on the actions of 
that same side, ...

                One of the first things I did when I committed myself to travelling around the world was to set up a blog. Indeed, I recently just assisted two other people in getting theirs up, one for a trip around the world, and one for a yearly RV trip down to Arizona. This post will give you easy instructions for how to set up a blog using WordPress.
Part of the motivation I find with most people is the desire to share some of their experiences, both positive and negative, with others. Since so much of tra...

                I've been traveling around the world for almost three years now. Without a doubt, nothing is more frustrating than trying to access Google, say in Argentina for example, and being presented with a Spanish website. I don't have exact numbers, but I'd say 80% of companies use some form of GeoIP (geo-location using the IP address as a means to determine where you are) to decide which language to serve you.
The problem of course is that even though I am currently in Portugal, I don't speak Portugues...

                Yesterday I was casually flipping around some apps on my iPhone and opened up my Adsense application which shows me how much I've made from Google Adsense each day. I noticed almost immediately that there was an anomaly - for the current day I had served almost 4,000 ad impressions, when normally it would have been more like 200 around that time of day. I then followed up by logging into Google Analytics to see if I had been mentioned somewhere, and sure enough I noticed that my number one refer...

                Last month I blogged the first part in my ongoing series in how to make money from a travel blog. You can read How to Make Money from a Travel Blog: Part One here.
Basically my goal has been to find a way to make a modest amount of money from my website so that I can offset some of the rather large expenses I incur while travelling around the world. While I've become quite adept at finding good deals, airfare and hotels are still expensive. So I set out with a rather modest goal of trying to mak...

While I've tried off and on to make a little money from my website over the years, it's never been something that was really important to me, primarily because I have another full time job that makes me more than enough money. Another reason is that I personally am not a huge fan of most advertising, as I find a lot of it to be intrusive.
That said, travelling around the world and writing about it isn't cheap. I likely spend anywhere from $6,000 a year ...

It's not like smoking where you have to go find the pack, pull out a lighter, and then light up. I'll literally be on the couch and realize my hand is in my mouth and I'm biting.

I have a queen sized bed, but only own one pillow. It makes sleeping strange. 2) I drink way too much diet pepsi, and usually have an empty bottle somewhere in every room 3) I typically buy the same thing whenever I'm at the store. That explains why I have four jars of salsa in my fridge, three ...

                I met with Rebecca and John tonight and we started finalizing the plans for WordCamp Whistler. We're hoping to nail down a venue in the next week or so, at which time we'll open up official registration. Given that we want to make the event as awesome and as interesting as possible, we're going to be charging a small admission for the event. In addition, we'll also be accepting sponsorship from a few organizations, which will hopefully cover the costs of the venue, and the social.
Stay tuned in ...

One of the best uses of QR codes in my mind involves the inclusion of QR code hyperlinks in printed media. That way a user could be reading a poster or a paper version of an article and still be able to navigate hyperlinks using their...

                I've been lying in bed for about 20 minutes now, trying to slow my brain down enough so that I can finally catch up on sleep. Unfortunately, my mind has been racing ever since blogathon, and it's been rather difficult to shut it off.
While in bed tonight, I started thinking about the day I had today, the people I spent it with, and the events of this past weekend. Like a hiker nearing the end of a long trek, I forced myself to stop and survey the trail from which I've come; the moments of exhaus...

                Well, I imagine by now many of the early morning shift people are in full swing. It seems like so long ago I wrote my first entry, and here I am at number 28. It sure is getting difficult finding content on short notice, but I'm managing to stay ahead of the curve somehow.

My Blogathon Setup
Rebecca did a quick tally on her blog, and I think between all the participants we are up to around $500 so far. That number doesn't include people who have gone directly to their charity's website and dona...

            <div class="meta mb-2 text-primary fs-6 fw-light">Published on July 26th, 2008</div>

            <div class="content mt-3">
                I read this interesting article today that basically said that most people in the United States were only 11 days away from financial ruin. That is, if they were to lose their jobs tomorrow, they only have enough money to last for about 11 days:

More than a third of adults could survive financially for only 11 days if they were to lose their job or be too ill to work, according to a survey.
The finding gives a worrying insight into the lives of millions who are living on a financial tightrope.

                San Francisco is without a doubt one of my favourite cities in the world. It's situated right on the Pacific Ocean, nestled snugly between Marin Country and Oakland. While Napa Valley is usually extremely hot, San Francisco boasts a fairly moderate climate, with sunshine occurring on most days of the year.
In August, there's going to be a WordCamp session down in San Francisco. Given that I'm a huge WordPress advocate, and that I love the Bay Area, I registered today and made the quick, imprompt...

                Thanks to everyone who has pledged so far. I'm currently up to $140, which will ultimately go to the Union Gospel Mission. I'd like to hit at least $1000, so if you want to sponsor, please head on over and contribute. I'll keep everyone updated during the event.
