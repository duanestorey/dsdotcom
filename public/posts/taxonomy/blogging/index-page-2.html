But seriously, things have been going rather great. I haven't had a single hiccup, and get complete SQL backups emailed to me twice a day, just in case something were to ever go wrong. All my data is backed up with RAID 5 storage (and w...

Tonight I was sitting at home debating drinking myself into a coma when Rebecca pinged me online and said I should come over for wine. I was pretty comfy in my flannel pants and briefly debated staying at home. But since I really needed a few drinks, I decided to head over as I was, flannel pants and all.

                As most of you know, there are several popular methods for obtaining statistics for your blog. While Google Analytics is probably the most comprehensive one I know (with the added benefit of being free), it is limited somewhat by the fact the the statistics are not real-time. For most practical purposes, that limitation isn't a big deal, but it's sometimes nice to be able to see what's going on within your website in real time.

                As you can see, my little advertising experiment with Commission Junction is pretty failtastic.

Which is strange, because the ads are fairly targeted based on a few specific, popular pages of mine. I'm not a big fan of advertising to tell you the truth -- I ripped Google Adsense off here a few months ago. To me, it's worth $10 a month or whatever not to have them pollute my main page. I was testing a new concept though with more targeted ads that I choose, but so far it's not working.

                I've been dabbling with a new caching engine for Wordpress over the last few weeks. While WP-Cache does a pretty decent job, it falls short in a few areas, and it's something I've been trying to fix. In particular, here's what I don't like about it:

It relies on the entire Wordpress engine to do it's caching
It doesn't make use of proper HTTP caching headers

The problem with the first item is that even if you have a cache hit, the entire Wordpress PHP core is parsed and partially executed. Wha...

                A while ago I attended a small function and snapped a pile of photos at it, putting most of them into a Flickr set so that others could view them and use them. While sitting at work today, I did a quick Google search to see if there were any other photos from the function, or any write-ups about it.

Unfortunately, not only did they not link back to the original photos,...

                As you can see, things look a little different around here after tonight. I got tired of looking at my old theme about two days after I put it up, but just didn't feel like doing anything about it. So tonight while watching Million Dollar Baby, I decided to take a stab and making it a bit different.
It's nothing fancy -- all I did is start with the default Wordpress theme and add a few things here and there. The main header is a HDR sunrise I did off my patio about a month ago. Gravatars are bro...

Starting at 1pm this afternoon, a group of internet enthusiasts will be gathering down at the Bryght offices for some food, drinks, Nintendo Wii and lots of fun. It's going to be a chance to mingle with like-minded people, enjoy some music, and even catch up on whatever internet-related project you currently have on the go.
I'll be meeting up later tonight with Kris, Kim, Boris, Rebecca, John, and a whack of other people I haven't met yet. I think Kim even challenged me to a ...
