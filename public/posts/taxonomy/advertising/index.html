                Back in the summer Future Shop had a sale on the extended BlueRay versions of the Lord Of the Rings. Given that they were basically 50% off and that I know I eventually wanted to buy a BlueRay player, I decided to buy a set.
Now that I'm back in Canada, I went out and finally bought a BlueRay player. I sat down over the Christmas break to watch a few of them, and I can say without a doubt that the quality of the films in excellent.
But what seems absolutely incredible to me is how each disc has ...

I'll admit, I don't get it. It's been four years now and yet Twitter is pushing forward with an advertising based revenue model (at least, pushing forward via a 3rd party).
I'm not Twitter, and for me to sit on the sidelines and recommend a revenue model for a service I'm not a part of is pretty weak. But that said, I honestly think people would pay for a Pro twitter service if Twitter would simply offer one. I think back to my days in the BBS era when we would all pay $50 (this is back in 1990...

                As you can see, my little advertising experiment with Commission Junction is pretty failtastic.

Which is strange, because the ads are fairly targeted based on a few specific, popular pages of mine. I'm not a big fan of advertising to tell you the truth -- I ripped Google Adsense off here a few months ago. To me, it's worth $10 a month or whatever not to have them pollute my main page. I was testing a new concept though with more targeted ads that I choose, but so far it's not working.
Is anyone...

                Ok, seriously. The things I would do if I had a few million bucks. I'm amazed to no end how many things about the internet kind of suck. Things that you'd think would be easy to fix, but for whatever reason nobody gets around to fixing them.
First company that I need to bash is YouTube. Seriously, Google buys you for 1.6 BILLION dollars and what's the first thing you do? Stick your head in the sand. How come there aren't any cool features, or you know, like standard features coming your way. Why...

                This is a rather interesting move made by Facebook. Apparently on Friday they announced a new javascript library that would let you put Facebook applications on your own web page.

Facebook announced Friday a new JavaScript client library that will allow Facebook apps to be displayed on any website.
The client library allows users to make Facebook API calls from any web site and create Ajax Facebook applications on that website.
Wei Zhu from Facebook explains the benefits:
