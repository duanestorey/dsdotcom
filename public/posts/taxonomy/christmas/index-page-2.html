                Sorry I haven't written anything for a few days, I've just been swamped trying to get my act together for December. First order of business is crazy Chad's Christmas party tonight out near Metrotown. Next week is my Christmas party at work, which is out on the water at Bridges, so that should be a good time.

                Sorry for the lack of entries around here. I've been meaning to write something, but whenever I find a few minutes worth of time, nothing really comes to mind.
First, I'm on day three of new antibiotics. Good news is that I feel a lot better again, which is a big relief and a really good sign in terms of outcome. Unfortunately, because the dosage is a bit larger, I'm finding that some of the side effects, namely headaches, are a bit worse as well. Also, I find myself extremely tired. The last fe...

                Well, here we are, at the end of another week. I'm so looking forward to relaxing a bit. There's a show tonight down at the Media Club I might go check out, but I haven't decided yet. Other than that, I'm probably going to stay close to home and get caught up on rest. December will probably be filled with lots of Christmas type things and a few parties, so I'm going to do my best not to wear myself down this month, considering I'm still on antibiotics. Good news is I saw a guy this morning who k...

                For some reason, I seem to get a lot of flack for getting ready for Christmas this early. There are those who can't possibly believe that someone would put their decorations up in November, instead waiting until the last minute to put theirs up.
For me, I love Christmas. I love coming home and flipping on the strand alongside my main window. I love being curled up on the couch with my duvet and a good movie, having no lights on except for the dim glow of my tree.

I don't think it's really possible. Clearly a $5 Santa hat is what I was missing in life.
Normally I'd just leave it as that, but I just did a semi-buzzed iChat with Rebecca and John, and we all just laid the smack down on the word CUTE, so I'm gonna post it here.

Yah, you might as well logoff now because you got nothing on that....

                There are some people who would say that getting excited about Christmas in November is a bit lame. And to them, I would say bah, humbug. Most of my best memories revolve around the Christmas season -- either friends in my university dorm sharing some eggnog (with rum of course), opening presents with my niece and nephew, or watching it snow in Ottawa from my festively-lit living room. I don't know why, but I just get excited when I start seeing lights up.
So tonight Kasia (a friend of mine who ...
