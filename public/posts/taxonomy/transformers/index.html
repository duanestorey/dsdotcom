                Today I met a few people down at the Paramount Theatre to watch the new Transformers movie. Rebecca, John Bollwitt, John Biehler and a few others (from the Facebook group we set up) all showed up to hear the infamous "cho-choo-cho-choo" transformation sound, and see Optimus up on the big screen again.

What we immediately commented on is that despite 21 people replying and saying they were coming, only seven or so showed up. After discussing it for a while, we sort of came to the conclusion that it's pretty easy to just accept an invitation on Facebook ...

                I normally have an immune system of steel. Not only is it pretty rare that I get sick, but when I do it normally doesn't last too long. In fact, I don't think I've taken more than three sick days in my entire life, and one of them was faked way back in high school.
However, I am now officially a full week into being sick with seem weird virus, and while I no longer seem to be getting worse, I've been stuck at the "pretty darn sick" alert level for a few days now, and it's getting tiresome. I wake up each morning hoping that I'll take a deep breath without coughing, but that just doesn't seem to ...

                Ok, it seems like almost 90% of all traffic hitting my website in the last week or so has been related to a blog posting I did a few months ago on the forth coming Transformers movie by Michael Bay. For those of you living in a cave, Michael Bay (director of Armageddon and Pearl Harbour) chose to turn the lovable, clickable toys from the 1980's into a full-fledged, live-action movie.

The movie premieres on June 20th around the world, and opens on July 3rd here in North America. If you head over to Ain't it Cool News, you can check out a few early reviews from people who have seen it already.

                Ok, so this is super geeky, but as a kid I used to love playing Transformers. For those of you who don't know, Michael Bay (Armageddon) has been working on a full length action movie about the transformers, and it's coming out July 4th.

The new exclusive trailer was just released a few minutes ago on Yahoo, and it looks pretty wild. It will probably suck as a movie, but it should be entertaining.
Check it out here.
