                I just got back from a little walk around Palermo Soho. It's about 32C right now, and it sure is a nice change to wear shorts and a t-shirt compared to the rain and cold gear I had on back home.
Without further ado, here's a little video I shot today with my new HD Kodak Playsport:
I spent yesterday trying to get a SIM for my cell phone down here. I basically walked all the way from Palermo Soho to Recoleta, which took me about 45 minutes each way. It was quite the adventure, and it's still not ...

                As I alluded to in my previous post today, I'm definitely looking at getting into video sometime in the near future. Considering I ordered a camera shortly after writing that post, "near future" is actually more like "early next week". I spent a solid twenty minutes or so trying to figure out what type of camera I wanted to purchase, and eventually narrowed it down to a few different ones.
In terms of features, I've always wanted a camera that could do 24P. Most consumer cameras shoot at 30 fram...

                So my friend Adrian is a really smart guy. I think he's completed four or more years of post secondary education, and managed the entire IT department singlehandedly at my company.
I put him up to a challenge to see how long it would take him to figure out how to get the case off my iPhone 3G. Here's the end result.
Only took him 43 seconds. Not bad.

                So, this is a fairly basic question. Lately, some people have been installing little rick roll blockers, thinking that it somehow protects them from being rick rolled simply because the video no longer plays. My take on that is that it's basically a form of cheating, and that if you clicked the link, you were rick rolled.
But let's see what my knowledgeable readers have to say. Chime in below:
