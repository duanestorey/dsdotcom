                My birthday is fast approaching, and the only real event I'm looking forward to is having a plate of nachos somewhere in the city with a friend or two. So, my question to all of you is: where are the best nachos in this city?
My favourites so far are probably the ones down at Smiley O'Neils on Pender, but I'm open to suggestions. Drop a comment if you've had nachos somewhere in the city and let everyone know how they were (if they sucked, say so).
I had nachos last night down at the Atlantic Trap and Gill, and the beef on them was actually a cut-up hamburger patty -- not cool people. Not cool. ...

                I eat subway pretty much an average of one time per day. In the little food court where I work it is the lesser of many evils, including A &amp; W, some Pizza place and a greasy chinese food place.
For the most part, I always order a little wrap, either filled with chicken or like this morning filled with ham and egg. It's not a hard thing to make really. You take some egg, put it in a wrap, but some ham and cheese on it and call it a sandwich.
However, it doesn't matter how many times I order a wrap, EVERY SINGLE TIME I DO it's like watching some huge elaborate machine grind to a freaking halt. ...

                Ok, this is a quick entry on something I've been meaning to write about for some time - tipping. For some reason, it seems like more and more places I visit now are introducing "tipping" into the system. In particular, a lot of interact machines I encounter are starting to show "please enter tip amount."
In the old days, you'd usually encountered a "Tip: Yes/No" question first, but I've seen the former more and more lately, and it's starting to piss me off. You see, I don't think you should tip if you're buying something across the counter. A good example is Fritz on Davie. If I'm ordering Poutine, ...
