                As many people know, I suffered a few facial fractures back in 2006. The primary result of that incident was to put my cheekbone slightly out of alignment, as well as the complete destruction of the bone under my left eye (other than maybe a 1mm ledge on one side, there's literally nothing there any more).
I had one surgery back in 2006 to put my eye back in the right place. It improved things slightly, but still left me with a droopy eye and some residual double vision. About six months later the surgeon did a CT scan, which ultimately looked like this:

The surgeon concluded at the time that ...

                My first MRI was actually fair bit shittier than I imagined. I got to the hospital about 40 minutes before my scheduled time, and went to the Jim Pattison pavilion (like I was told). Unfortunately, there was no MRI facility in the JPP, and at that hour there wasn't really anyone to ask. I found an information kiosk that showed a MRI lab in the Centennial Pavilion, so I hurried down there and took a seat in the waiting room.
Of course, there wasn't anyone in the reception booth so I just sat in the corner hoping that it was the correct place. There were a few other people in the waiting room with ...

                I just did a quick check of my Google calendar for the week, and it's look pretty jam packed for the next few weeks. Things start off with a bang tomorrow -- I have to go to St. Paul's Hospital for some intestinal tests in the morning, and head down to Vancouver General Hospital tomorrow evening for an MRI (two hospitals in one day people, good times). Just did some reading on an MRI, and it's not a very dangerous procedure, unless you have certain types of implants in your eye socket. I'm fairly certain mine is ok, otherwise we wouldn't be going ahead with this, but I've seen one too many TV ...

                Just got a call from Vancouver General Hospital. Turns out in just a few weeks I'll get the privilege of relaxing inside a big metal tube for an hour down in the MRI clinic. Apparently I can wear my own clothes, as long as there isn't any metal on them at all. Otherwise the metal will probably rip out and go crazy in the huge magnetic fields.

The good news is that MRI's don't use radiation, which means my super powers will probably not be affected this round (I figure with all the CT scans and X-rays I had last year, I've had my share).
Should be a fun time, staring at the inside of a tube while ...
