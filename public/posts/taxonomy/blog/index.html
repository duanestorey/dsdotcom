                I was recently looking for a decently priced VPS where I could host a couple of small to medium sized websites. I actually signed up for a few random ones that I found on Google and tried them for a few days, but they didn't strike me as working very well. One of them actually crashed after about an hour, and it took about eight hours for support to finally restart it for me.
Eventually I started looking around the internet a bit more, and ran into a relatively new company called Digital Ocean.

                One of the first things I did when I committed myself to travelling around the world was to set up a blog. Indeed, I recently just assisted two other people in getting theirs up, one for a trip around the world, and one for a yearly RV trip down to Arizona. This post will give you easy instructions for how to set up a blog using WordPress.
Part of the motivation I find with most people is the desire to share some of their experiences, both positive and negative, with others. Since so much of tra...

While I've tried off and on to make a little money from my website over the years, it's never been something that was really important to me, primarily because I have another full time job that makes me more than enough money. Another reason is that I personally am not a huge fan of most advertising, as I find a lot of it to be intrusive.
That said, travelling around the world and writing about it isn't cheap. I likely spend anywhere from $6,000 a year ...

                As you can see, things around here have changed. I finally got around to doing something I've wanted to do for quite sometime - I've removed all my old entries. Obviously I have backups of everything I wrote, and can reimport things at a later time. But truthfully, pretty much everything I wrote in the old days is all over the map, and I've been thinking about starting to write consistently in a few different areas.

Today was a long day, and tomorrow will likely be as well. Good news is there's a light shining at the end of the tunnel (hopefully it's not a fuse).

                Well, thus ends Blogathon 2009 - it was quite the adventure, one that I'm glad I was a part of again. The official Blogathon website shows approximately $40,000 raised for the various charities this weekend, which is totally awesome. Of that amount, approximately $1,250 was raised by the content on this blog, and by the people who supported my efforts and the BC Children's Hospital Foundation. So once again, you guys all have my sincerest thanks.

                I was talking to a few people on the weekend about this current iteration for my theme, and it seems there's enough interest that I might eventually set this up as a download, or add it to the WordPress theme repository. But, I'd like a bit more input from some photographers about features I can potentially add.
One thing I was thinking of incorporating was a stand-alone microstock service. For example, beside each photo there would be a "Buy" button that would take you to PayPal. Once you paid ...

I thought I'd post a few of my favourite shots here for those that are new here.





Most of these shots make use of a technique called high dynamic range (HDR) photography.

                Up until about a year ago, I used to comment entirely using the name "Duane". There wasn't really any big motivation for doing so, it was simply something I was used to doing from my old IRC chats. At one point though, I realized that it seemed a bit weird leaving big, technical comments on web-sites but not having my name associated with them. At the bare minimum, it felt like it lessened the impact of what I wrote if I use only my first name, or if used an alias.

It's not really that hard to set up your own Apache server, and Linux can literally run for months or more without requiring a reboot. The downside of course is that home internet connections can be flaky, and most co-locations and hosting companies have UPS backup when things go wrong.

                I spent most of the last hour on the couch, just thinking by candlelight. It was a nice break from the norm, having a dark apartment sans the sound of computer fans spinning or other randomness that goes beep in the night.
Looking out my window, it's hard to tell just how many people participated. It seems slightly darker than normal I guess, but for the most part it looks like business as usual in this city.
For those of you who missed it, I took my site down for a few hours in support of the e...

                Today I took the plunge and quickly upgraded my Wordpress installation from 2.3.3 to the Beta for 2.5. In terms of look and feel on the front-end, I doubt you'll notice any major changes (especially on sites where you don't have to login). However, they've completely overhauled the administration section in the back to make things a little easier to find.
I'm not going to really review it, because in all fairness it's not quite done yet. However, the back end does seem a bit slower, maybe due to...

                As some of you know, last year I went from having my blog hosted on GoDaddy to using shared hosting services over at HostMonster (and before that, I went from having a Linux box on the floor of my bedroom to GoDaddy). Shared hosting is a fairly cheap way to set up a website, and you can usually get away with it for less than $10/mo. For the most part, I was pretty happy with HostMonster shared hosting, although in these last few months their databases kept falling over, and I had intermittent co...
