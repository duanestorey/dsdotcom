                    In just three days, I'll be heading to the airport again on what will undoubtedly be a great tour of North America. I'm meeting Luciana in Toronto, and her and I will slowly make our way via train to Qu√©bec City. From there we are going to head back to Ottawa for a weekend, then off to Banff, Lake Louise and hopefully Jasper. After a brief stop in Vancouver, we're going to head down to San Francisco for some San Francisco Giants baseball action, and hopefully a few winery tours.
 Driving in the Canadian Rocky Mountains
Many of the places we are heading to are places I haven't spent much time ...

                    I posted a blog entry on my personal site detailing how I was feeling last night. Since that time I've migrated to Vancouver and have checked into a nice suite at the Coast Plaza and Suite Hotels in Vancouver.
Coast Hotels has supported various trips I've made over the years, and I'm definitely thankful to them for helping put me up from time to time. I'm actually in a suite on their top floor right now, with an absolutely amazing view of the Pacific Ocean from my window. If you're looking for a great Vancouver hotel, then make sure you check out the Coast Hotels in Vancouver.

I'm about 36 hours ...

I'm originally from a small little town about 150 kilometres east of Vancouver called Chilliwack. It's a picturesque farming town nestled between a few mountain ranges, and far enough away from Vancouver to have a little peace and quiet.
And while Chilliwack is my birthplace and where my most of my family lives, I've spent nearly a third of my life living in Vancouver, either out at UBC where I did nine years of post secondary education, or in the downtown core, where I've worked the majority of my career.
When I set out on my upcoming travel adventure, it'll be from a familiar place: Vancouver ...

                    Vancouver's known for a lot of things -- fun patios where you can drink beer outdoors isn't one of them. If you know of any patios in Vancouver, drop a comment. My favourite patio is the Kingston pub on Richards I believe. They also make pretty darn good nachos.

So, what's your favourite patio in the city, and why do you like it? ...

                    My birthday is fast approaching, and the only real event I'm looking forward to is having a plate of nachos somewhere in the city with a friend or two. So, my question to all of you is: where are the best nachos in this city?
My favourites so far are probably the ones down at Smiley O'Neils on Pender, but I'm open to suggestions. Drop a comment if you've had nachos somewhere in the city and let everyone know how they were (if they sucked, say so).
I had nachos last night down at the Atlantic Trap and Gill, and the beef on them was actually a cut-up hamburger patty -- not cool people. Not cool. ...
