                It has been a long-time dream of mine to finally visit Machu Picchu, the Lost City of the Incas. I actually tried several times over the last few years, but somehow never made it to the ruins. I even bought a plane ticket earlier this year from Vancouver to Cuzco, Peru, but ended up not being able to go due to work commitments. Since I've been living in Brasil for the last month with my girlfriend, we decided it would be a good opportunity to finally visit Peru and Machu Picchu.

                Luciana and I headed to the airport around 1am last night, with plans to catch a flight at 3:50am for Lima. Obviously that's not an ideal flight time, but since it was heavily discounted we thought we could live with it. Another reason we booked that particular flight is that it was with TAM airlines, and they happen to be with Star Alliance. Since I'm going for Gold Status this year with Star Alliance, I welcomed the chance to get 6,000 more miles with them.
Unfortunately when we got to the airport, TAM told us that we had to go over to LAN's counter and check-in with them. I said I was confused ...

                I few months ago I blogged about the fact that I had finally purchased a ticket to go to Peru and see Machu Picchu. Unfortunately due to the launch of WPtouch Pro 3, I wasn't able to go at the time, and ended up tossing a $1,000 plane ticket in the garbage since Expedia wouldn't give me a refund.
All in all though the launch was a big success, so I can't really complain. Sacrifices like that are part of owning your own business, and why I personally don't feel as guilty when I enjoy a bit of relaxation time when things occasionally slow down for a while.
Now that I'm finally back in South America, ...

                I was sort of hoping to keep this trip a secret, but enough people know now that it doesn't seem to make any sense to not talk about it anymore (basically, I suck at secrets).
While I have been to South America twice now, there is one destination there that I have never been able to make happen on my previous trips - I have always wanted to visit Peru, and in particular Machu Picchu, the Lost City of the Incas (now found, thankfully). So I decided to finally plan a trip to Peru.

I've also aligned the trip to coincide exactly with my birthday, which will be a ...

Hard to believe, but at this time about a month ago I was boarding a plane in Vancouver to start my big adventure. I was trying to remember my flight down here, and other than a few moments in the airport and on the plane, I don't really recall too much of it. Truthfully it seems like a very long time ago already.
I've been in Buenos Aires now for 30 days, and have seen quite a bit of it. A month ago I didn't know how to do laundry, didn't have a phone here, wasn't able to order food in a restaurant, and had no idea where the best places were to get money. Thirty days later I have most of those ...

                I don't know why, but I'm excited that it's a new month. Maybe because I'm fully booked for my trip to Igauza falls in 17 days, or possibly because it's a trip to Machu Picchu is probably on the horizon. Either way, I'm feeling fine, and today is a new day in a new month.
I left Vancouver on January 4th, so that means I've been here nearly a month now. Time flies. I have a little widget on my phone with my rough itinerary in it, and it says I have 57 days left in Buenos Aires. I fly out on March 30th for New York City, where I'll be meeting my business partner and his girlfriend for a few days ...

I went looking tonight to find out what the new 7 Wonders of the World were. I remember as a kid hearing that phrase a few times, and I thought there would be some straightforward list somewhere that simply listed them off in order. Unfortunately I've now come to the realization that there are many different variants of the list, all of which were undoubtedly influenced by different countries trying to be on the list such that their tourism industries would benefit. In fact, if you browse through the Wikipedia entries for Wonders Of The World, you'll find around six or seven different variants, ...
