                    I was doing a Google search the other day, looking for some photos of me at the last company I worked at, when I discovered US patent 7,958,276, Automatic Configuration of Peripheral Devices.

When I worked at my previous company I started playing around with an algorithm to automatically configure a voice over IP device. One of the main problems people would have previously is that they would plug in a new audio device and have to spend a pile of time figuring out how to configure it. The same was true with video. So at the time I came up with basically a complicated priority list that would ...

                    I was in bed, reading the BBC's website on my iPad using their ultra cool application, when I came across an article showing new research linking blood fats with heart disease. The link to that article is here.
First, I should point out that there's never really been a definitive link between high fat diets and heart disease. That comes as a surprise to a lot of people, mainly because it's recited over and over so often as to be the conventional dogma. But research has never really backed that up in any capacity.
There is a mild link between cholesterol and heart disease, but it's often misconstrued ...

                    This is actually kind of a sore spot, so I thought that I would touch upon it. The New York Times recently announced that they were going to start charging for content in 2011.
Strangely enough, most people who grew up in the Internet age seem to think that everything, including premium content, should be free of charge. I personally don't believe that's the case, and would even go so far to say that having an economy based on content generated at the expense of advertising dollars is an extremely bad thing. But at the end of the day, it always amazes me how little people are willing to pay for ...

                    I do the odd post from time to time on health issues and current research I think is interesting. About a year ago I posted an article discussing how caffeine seems to have a negative influence on the body's insulin signaling, which ultimately affects blood sugar levels in the blood. What this ultimately means is that caffeine might be a major contributing factor in the obesity epidemic, since high insulin levels in the blood promote the storage of fat and make it difficult to burn it.
Here's a recent 2008 study that investigated the effects of caffeinated coffee and decaffeinated coffee on the ...

                    I just read the results of an interesting study done down south. Apparently americans spend approximately three hours per week grooming themselves and looking good, but less than an hour (per week people) on foreplay and intercourse. So it appears the collective mass would rather look good in bed than be good in bed.

Here's a couple of paragraphs from the write-up.

Americans spend nearly three hours every week grooming themselves, but less than one hour on foreplay and sexual intercourse. It's no wonder that only 46% of us describe our love lives as exciting, or existent for that matter.

For those of you who follow nutritional research, you may remember Gary from a controversial article he wrote in 2002 in the New York Times called 'What If It's Been A Big Fat Lie?&quot; In that article, ...

So if you have any friends that have blogs and can help out, please direct them to me. I'm collecting data in real time right now, so it will be interesting to see what it'll all look like after a few days.
When this is done, we should all have a pretty intimate insight into all the various hosting companies out there and how they compare to each other during normal wear and tear.

I need a bunch of volunteers to help out. Basically all I'll need you to do is upload a file to your root directory and allow me to ping it from time to time to do some measurements. I'll tabulate the data next week and put it online for everyone to see.
So, if you can help out, drop me a comment and let me know:

The name of your hosting company
The address to your site
Your email address where I can contact you about this
