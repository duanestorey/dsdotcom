                    This morning I got to walk along Robson Street and watch the protests as they occurred. Given that I saw first-hand how the police officers and the protesters interacted, I thought I would make a few comments.
First, it is everyone's democratic right in Canada to be allowed to protest peacefully -- these rights are protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
