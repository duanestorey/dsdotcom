                    Today is a grumpy day for me. I haven't had a good sleep for a few days, and woke up with snot dripping all over my face. That being said, I wanted to point something out on my site.
I've been told that one of the most disrespectful things you can do in the corporate world is to add someone as a CC to an email. Basically once you're on an email thread, you're there to stay, whether you like it or not. Ever remove someone from a CC list? It happens I'm sure, but it's not the norm. Ideally you'd ping someone on IM or some other back channel and ask a person before adding them to a CC list. "Hey ...

                    Friday afternoon I logged into my myspace account after a long absence and, after debating about it for about 3 seconds, deleted my account entirely. It's not like it caused me any headache or anything, but I just don't use it really at all anymore and don't have time to maintain that and my facebook account. So, after searching around for a while, I managed to find the "Delete Account" button and forever put it into the trash.
Anyone else actually still use myspace, or has everyone migrated to Facebook now?
Also, a few people have been tracking my new blog entries with twitter - if you have twitter, ...

                    Is it just me, or is facebook getting a little old these days? Except for the event planning thing, which I think is fairly useful, there's not really a lot about it that I really think is that great anymore. And to be honest, I'm getting a little tired of saying ignore to things like the funwall, or turkey tossing and what have you. I know people are just having a little fun with it, but I'm just not that interested in alot of those things everyone is inviting each other with. It's not really a big deal, as I don't get enough of them to where it takes a lot of time out of my day, I just don't ...
