                    I'll admit, keeping up with birthdays on my blog is pretty hard to do. I have a hard enough time remembering dates and making phone calls when they roll around, something I'm thankful my sister helps me out with. That being said, I missed blogging about one on Sunday, probably because I was so exhausted from Blogathon.

It was my dad's birthday this last Sunday, and I just wanted to wish him a happy belated birthday from my website here. I managed to remember to call him on Sunday, but somehow this blog entry got missed (sorry bud).
Hopefully we can get together for a quick drink sometime in the ...

                    Today is my father's birthday. He has been spending the last few days on a great fishing trip adventure, flying around various parts of British Columbia with some friends and fishing. As I've pointed out before, my dad is not only my father, but also one of my good friends. We've had lots of great adventures together, and hopefully we'll keep the tradition going.

Given that we're both so busy these days, it's not very often we manage to get together and hang out. But that fact makes the time we do spend together that much more enjoyable.
So on that note, I want to wish my dad an awesome birthday. ...

                    Ahh, relaxation. Definitely enjoying it. I've been sleeping lots, eating lots, and watching a pile of movies. For the most part, my ass has been firmly planted on the living room couch, but I've managed to get outside a bit and see some relatives.

Today is Christmas over at my sister's house. Since my parents are split, today is Christmas with my mom's side of the family. I have two gifts each for my niece and nephew, so I'll bring one set over today and leave the other here at my dad's for tomorrow's round. Us adults don't really buy for each other, but we've always sort of enjoyed getting the ...

He went into New West. yesterday for angioplasty, and the initial word is that the surgery was a complete success. He's got another 50 years of camping with the current hardware now. I spoke to him last night in the hospital via phone and he's relieved and obviously happy to be going home. ...

                    So, this weekend I decided to leave the city life behind and join my dad and Cathy for a few days in the wilderness down south.? The destination was a little place along the ocean called Fort Casey, near Deception Pass, Washington.? I had a great time, consuming an ample amount of alcoholic beverages, and sitting by the fire.
Unfortunately, the one major downside to travelling to the United States is having to go through customs on both sides.? No matter how many times I cross, or how many stamps I have in my passport, I always get grilled pretty hard.? It's gotten worse now that I have a decent ...
