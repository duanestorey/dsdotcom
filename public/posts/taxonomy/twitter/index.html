I'll admit, I don't get it. It's been four years now and yet Twitter is pushing forward with an advertising based revenue model (at least, pushing forward via a 3rd party).
I'm not Twitter, and for me to sit on the sidelines and recommend a revenue model for a service I'm not a part of is pretty weak. But that said, I honestly think people would pay for a Pro twitter service if Twitter would simply offer one. I think back to my days in the BBS era when we would all pay $50 (this is back in 1990, so probably more like $100 now) simply to have a (+) next to our BBS name. That's a form of vanity ...

Dale wrote a pretty informative post over on BraveNewCode, so check it out. In short, we'll be releasing a very reasonably priced paid version that includes support first, then will eventually roll out another free version using the new codebase.

                    I've been trying to get more work done during the days lately, mainly so that I have less work to do in the evenings. One thing I've been trying to curb is my Twitter and Facebook usage.
Some days I hardly use either, but sometimes when there's a good conversation going on, I find it hard to pull away from. In addition, I do a lot of things on the computer almost instinctively, one of which is saving files after every small edit (at the end of every line of code I usually hammer on command-S, which saves the file -- I don't even think about it, it just happens). Similarly, if I have a browser ...

                    One of the things I've noticed lately is that I'm spending way more time on Twitter than I'd like. Truthfully, it's fairly addictive, and I really don't know why. This afternoon I noticed I noticed myself sitting on the updates page, refreshing occasionally, waiting for a few replies to some messages I had sent out. While doing that, I had the sudden idea that Twitter (at least for me) would be a bit more useful if it were a push system instead of a polling system. That way at least, I wouldn't have to sit at the site and continue to poll it -- I could simply be notified when a new @ message was ...

                    By no means am I a twitter expert. In fact, I'm not really even certain what that moniker means. Saying you're an expert at Twitter is like saying you're an expert at talking, or being able to hold a conversation. Sure, you have to understand what an @ sign does, and how to direct message someone, but other than that Twitter is just another tool in a wide arsenal of technology that allows people to establish and build relationships.
I used to only follow my friends on Twitter. Even though I replied to most @ messages directed at me, I didn't follow everyone back, simply because I wanted to keep ...

I've been using Twitter for a long time now, and the one universal constant in that time period has been the flakiness of the Twitter service. Even today, at least a year after some of these problems started cropping up, you still get the occasional "Fail Whale" when the servers can't keep up. Some of the other random problems I've witnessed lately are:

disappearing avatars
the inability to upload a new avatar
missing background images on profiles
flaky service (i.e. the Fail Whale)
messages that appear 30 - 60 minutes after they were tweeted

Obviously running a service that can handle millions ...

Ah yes, in what is probably one of the most documented penis measuring contests in recorded history, Ashton Kutcher has quickly vaulted his way up to 1,000,000 followers.
For whatever reason, Twitter seems to have disabled the unfollow/follow button his account, so people can't unfollow him. Thankfully, the Twitter API has a solution to this problem. If you want to unfollow Ashton, try the following:
From a Linux or a Mac both (or something that supports curl), simply type the following:

                    I sat down right now to write a blog entry, and this is the one I came up with. There have been numerous entries on various websites over the last few weeks that have hinted that blogging is dead. While I don't necessarily believe them, I can't help but see some truth in a few of their statements.
First, let it not be forgotten that the *ability* to blog is at an all time maximum. Thanks to the work of Automattic and WordPress, it's relatively painless to start a blog, either on WordPress.com or on your own hosted server. That being said, I have to question just how many people are listening these ...

We did a quick domain name check and realized that TweetDuJour.com was available. Since I had my iPhone with me, I quickly purchased it.
After work tonight I decided to finally whip something together really quick for it. We created a user on Twitter called TDJ (Tweet Du Jour) and tied its @replies into the TweetDuJour website. We're hoping people who encounter cool Tweet's during the day ...

Anyone else actually still use myspace, or has everyone migrated to Facebook now?
