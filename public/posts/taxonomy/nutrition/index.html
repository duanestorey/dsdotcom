                With regards to my post from yesterday regarding c. diff. First, I want to thank my mom for the eighty or so phone calls and emails she's sent me regarding the subject since that blog entry went up: thanks for caring, mom. Don't worry, I'm ok.
Second, I've decided to change my diet in the short term to see if I can find a food trigger. Pretty much the only time I've felt normal again for a period of time was actually when I was in Cancun in March. For basically a whole week, my stomach problems went away and I felt pretty much 100% for a while.
I spent about 30 minutes today making a mental list ...

                So, it's only been about 5 days since I started, but I thought I'd drop a quick update. As most of you know, I am a big supporter of low-carbohydrate diets, mostly because a great deal of research show they are superior for treating things like diabetes and heart disease, but also because I once lost a great deal of weight (with relative ease) by just giving up carbs.
Effectively, the last few days have really been a transition from a moderate carbohydrate to a low-carb one for me. I've been keeping accurate food, weight and activity logs, which should help me figure out what's working and what's ...

                1977, in front of the House Agriculture Subcommittee of Domestic Marketing, talking about the recent recommendations by the USDA and Food and Nutrition Board towards a low-fat diet:

However tenuous that linkage, however disappointing the various intervention trials, it still seems prudent to propose to the American public that we not only maintain reasonable weights for our height, body structure and age, but also reduce our dietary fat intakes significantly, and keep cholesterol to a minimum. And, conceivably, you might conclude that it is proper for the federal government to so recommend.
