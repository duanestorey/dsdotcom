While I've tried off and on to make a little money from my website over the years, it's never been something that was really important to me, primarily because I have another full time job that makes me more than enough money. Another reason is that I personally am not a huge fan of most advertising, as I find a lot of it to be intrusive.
That said, travelling around the world and writing about it isn't cheap. I likely spend anywhere from $6,000 a year or so on plane tickets, and lots of other money on tourist attractions, subway tickets, bus rides, and ...

                    I'm up to a little over 60 kilometres worth of biking on my new bike, and so far I'm really enjoying getting outside again. The first few rides I did were pretty painful, both from a muscle perspective and also from a cardio perspective. But I'm up to about 16 kilometres a ride now, and I can see myself doing a 25 kilometre ride fairly soon as well.
I've actually been using the RunKeeper application on my iPhone to track my progress. It's a free application as well as a free service (there's a paid upgrade option). I don't think I'll upgrade, mainly because I don't think I'd need any of the perks ...

                    For those of you who follow what goes on in the web services part of the internet, this little tidbit may interest you. Amazon has offered relatively cheap cloud computer for the last year or so, but one of the major downsides was that it didn't have a static IP address. So if all your machines / images were to crash at the same time (which has happened before due to a power or internet outage), you lose your IP address and potentially may be allocated a new one when you restart your service.
Today Amazon announced that they are offered Elastic IP addresses (which is a funky way of saying Static ...
