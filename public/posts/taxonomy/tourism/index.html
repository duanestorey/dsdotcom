                    One of the most impressive geological formations in the world are the Cliffs of Moher located in County Claire, Ireland. Located approximately an hour drive away from Galway, it's an easily accessible location in the beautiful Burren region of Ireland, which has an eerie resemblance to a moonscape.
 The Cliffs of Moher in Ireland
I visited the Cliffs once in 2011, but unfortunately it was foggy and didn't make for very nice photos. Thankfully I got a chance to go back again yesterday and got to see the Cliffs of Moher with much better sunshine this time. If you're going to visit the Cliffs of ...

                    This last weekend I had the opportunity to visit the world renowned Japanese Gardens in Buenos Aires. Outside of Japan, they are some of the largest Japanese Gardens in the world, and I have been looking forward to visiting them ever since I arrived.
The Japanese Gardens are located in Buenos Aires, just north of the Palermo area and the Buenos Aires zoo. I walked there from my apartment near Paraguay and Gurrachuga, and it took me about 30 minutes or so to get there.

This was the first real trip I had done in Buenos Aires where I decided to take my digital SLR along with me. At the advice of ...

                    I'm somewhere near Surrey I think, stuck near the back on a Greyhound bus. The mood here is pretty dismal -- most people are either sleeping or in some weird state of iPod euphoria. The scheduled arrival time, barring any major road hiccups, is around 12:10pm I think. The first order of business for me will be to store my luggage somewhere, most likely in a locker in the bus terminal. That'll of course mean that I have to come back and get it later, but that's way better than walking around with a suitcase all day.

It's no secret that I haven't been a huge supporter of the Olympics games in Vancouver. ...

                    Someone on Twitter tomorrow asked for some advice on things to see and do in Tokyo, so I thought I'd write a bit about my trip in April of 2006. At the last minute, my employer asked me to attend a SIP interoperability conference in Tokyo. Since I had never been to Asia before, I thought it would be a pretty awesome trip.
Derek and I left Vancouver sometime in the afternoon on a Saturday I believe, and we landed in Tokyo 10 hours later. Narita airport is actually more than an hour outside of Tokyo, so even after you land you still have a fairly long trek to get into the city. Derek and I paid ...

                    I approximately 24 hours, I'll be stepping off a plane at Heathrow and rushing madly to see some of London before my connecting flight to Vancouver leaves in the early evening. I think I'll probably only have about 3 and a half hours to see London, which I'm sure doesn't give me much time to see very much. With the time constraints, it looks like I'm gonna shell out $100 for the express train that goes from the airport to Paddington Station near central London. From there, I'm really not sure what I'm going to do. It still seems like quite a haul to get to any of the attractions, so I imagine ...
