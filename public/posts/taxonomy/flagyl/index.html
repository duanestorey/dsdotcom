                Back in roughly 2007, I managed to acquire a clostridium difficile infection. It's a really serious infection, usually preceded by antibiotic exposure, and it can often can lead to death if not treated. In my case, it mostly started out with flu symptoms, but gradually led to me being hospitalized for a few days due to loss of fluids.
Once being discharged from the hospital, I was prescribed flagyl to combat the c. diff infection. I did one or two rounds of that over a month or two, but unfortun...

                Almost two years ago, I was at work one day, banging on the keys and writing some code. Suddenly, I felt cold, and realized that my hands and my fingers were shaking. I tried to stay at work as long as I could, but after a while my hands were shaking so bad I could hardly function at my job, so I went home.
I curled into bed, and wrapped my duvet as tightly as it would go around myself. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't stop shivering. I ended up eventually falling asleep, and slept mo...

                A few minutes ago, I took the last of the foul-tasting, side-effect inducing crud that I started nearly four weeks ago. The last few days have been particularly hard, and I've found myself extremely tired, have had a metallic taste in my mouth, and also a fairly bad migraine. While most of my family played board games tonight, I was forced to retire to the couch in the other room and attempt to out-sleep my pounding head.

                Today was a strange day. I woke up this morning and went down to the clinic to get the results of some tests I had done this week. If you've been keeping up with my saga, I somehow got a digestive infection when I was in the hospital with pneumonia a few months ago. It's not contagious or anything - about 10% of people in the hospital get it after a week, and over 50% of people generally get it after four weeks in a hospital. You typically don't get this unless your body is hit with a really har...
