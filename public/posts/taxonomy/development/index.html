                Going through Google reader tonight, I've encountered a lot of shared articles about the Apple iPhone SDK. And for the most part, every one of the articles praises the SDK and Apple's approach with it.

But in pure Office Space style, I'm going to have to go ahead and, you know, sort of disagree with you all. In particular, I'm going to outline a few points from one specific article and give my take as a cross platform application developer who actually *has* developed softw...

                Tonight, while sitting at home on the couch, I was reminded of a conversation I had last week with someone that I hadn't talked to in quite some time. That person was someone I used to hang out with quite a bit in university, but haven't really seen that much of in the last few years. We both somehow ended up in software development, although I've stayed more along the lines of developing software while he has moved on to managing a small team of developers.
The thing is, I left the conversation...

                I got my first roll back of Ilford XP2 back from development. My overall impression of it is pretty good - the grain is pretty light for ISO 400 (at least my memory of what ISO 400 was). It's not as contrasty as I normally like, and I bumped the contrast up slightly before posting them, but it's not that bad. The dynamic range is pretty decent, and the only shots that it struggled with were taken outside in the sun. All in all, I'm impressed enough that I'll give it another go.
