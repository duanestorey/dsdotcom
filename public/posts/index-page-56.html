                I quickly stopped by Future Shop on my way home tonight and picked up a brand new power supply for my server at home. They had a really nice (that is, if power supplies can be described as such) $150 one that was on sale for $75, so I went with that. The good news is that my old power supply was basically taxed in terms of connectors, and it would have been impossible to add anything else to it. This new one has an extra 300W of headroom on it, and also 3 more SATA connectors.

That's why I have always gravitated towards jobs that don't have fixed hours. Where I currently work, I really don't have a fixed schedule. If I wake up early, I'll stroll in at 8:30am. If I have a rough night sleeping, nobody cares when I stroll in at 10:30am. Given that flexibility, I'll often do a bit of work at home during the evenings when I'm listening to music or whatever.

At the end of the night there was always a big concert on Parliament Hill.
