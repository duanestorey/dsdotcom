                <p>I originally wasn't going to bring my SLR along at all on my trip, mainly because it would take up a pile of room. As the departure day loomed in front of me though, I just couldn't bring myself to travel the world with only my point and shoot.</p>
<p>As a compromise I decided to bring along the <a href="http://amzn.to/18O9EsJ">Canon EF 28mm f/1.8 lens</a>, which I bought right before coming. On a 1.6x crop factor it acts more like a 44mm lens, which is close to a standard lens but slightly wider. I was hoping that would be a useful field of view for most situations.</p>
<p>I find it a little long for walking around the city, but it's decent enough for doing portraits (although I haven't done any yet). I probably should have brought along a zoom, but I've made do with the prime so far.</p>
<p>Anyways, here are a few shots I took today with the lens nearly wide open. It's actually a decent little lens, even if it's a little softer than I had hoped.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/5449467500_fbb02434d6_z-2.jpg"><img src="../assets/posts/2011/5449467500_fbb02434d6_z-2.webp" alt="" title="Argentina" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/5449328700_0933a1d8c1_z-2.jpg"><img src="../assets/posts/2011/5449328700_0933a1d8c1_z-2.webp" alt="" title="Argentina" /></a></p>
<p>And a few longer shots:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/5336291343_b5f5489ff6_z-1.jpg"><img src="images/5336291343_b5f5489ff6_z-1.jpg" alt="" title="5336291343_b5f5489ff6_z-1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/5357156195_55b5ddbf4e_z-3.jpg"><img src="images/5357156195_55b5ddbf4e_z-3.jpg" alt="" title="5357156195_55b5ddbf4e_z-3" /></a></p>
<p>So all in all, quite a decent little lens. It's definitely not as sharp as the 50mm f/1.4, and probably not as sharp as the 50 f/1.8, but it does a pretty good job all-around for the price. If you're looking for another good prime addition to your kit, then definitely check out the <a href="http://amzn.to/18O9EsJ">Canon EF 28mm f/1.8 lens</a>.</p>
