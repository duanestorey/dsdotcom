            <p>The American Heart association has just gone on record <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/08/25/aha.sugar.added/index.html">as recommending that sugar consumption be drastically reduced</a>. I should point out that this is in stark contrast to their longly held assertions that saturated fat is the primary cause of heart disease, and carbohydrates essentially are harmless. So this is a warning to everyone that you should limit your sugar intake in the interest of good health.</p>
<p>I personally wouldn't be surprised at all if you'll continue to see these ongoing shifts in policy, up to the point where the policy has completely changed to recommend that refined carbohydrates be cut-out or severely limited as well. I mean, if the research ultimately shows that refined carbohydrate (including sugar) was the significant contributor to obesity, diabetes and heart disease, and the official position of the AHA was that these foods should form the basis of all heart-healthy diets, there could be a pretty a big problem for someone.</p>
