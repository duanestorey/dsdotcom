                <p>It's strange living in my apartment right now. I have half of the place boxed up, and am slowly selling the rest of it off. Even though my bed is still set up, it doesn't really feel like home anymore, so I've been sleeping on my couch in the living room. That couch was one I bought back in 2001 in Ottawa, and we've been through a lot together. When I leave this place it's going to its final resting place at my sister's house, but it's been a comfy companion for the last ten years.</p>
<p>My bar stools sold tonight, as did my entertainment unit. In terms of large furniture, that leaves my bedroom suite, my kitchen table set, my coffee table, and everything in my office. I'm not too worried about those items, since I suspect most of them will sell rather quickly on Craigslist. But, after I get through with my bedroom tomorrow, there really isn't going to be too much more to do here at home.</p>
<p>On Friday I board a plane in Vancouver for Cancun. I'm meeting up with Dale for a week of beers, strategizing, and relaxation. Even though Dale and I spend about two hours a day on the phone, we probably only get a chance to hang out in person about twice a year, which is strange considering how much our lives really are intertwined. But, it'll be great to catch up in person and chill out by the pool.</p>
<p>As soon as I return from Cancun, I'm going to put everything into storage and vacate this place. If the place is empty early, I may head to Chicago and visit some friends, or possibly even San Francisco. But, there's really not much time left in my time here in Chilliwack.</p>
