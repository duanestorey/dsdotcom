                <p>I'm sure many of you know already know who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Feist">Leslie Feist</a> is. She's one of Canadian's most recognized young musicians now, thanks to obvious talent and also having her song 1-2-3-4 included in one of Apple's largest marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, Feist snagged five awards at the Junos, which is as close to a landslide as you can really have at an event like that. I unfortunately didn't get to meet her (she was rather popular that night), but I did get to hang out a few feet away from her and snap a few photos.</p>

<p>I was doing some reading in my RSS reader this morning and came across this <a href="http://purplegables.com">cute video of Feist</a> that was recently on Sesame Street over on my friend Kasia's blog. I used to watch that show a lot as a kid (I'm sure most of us did), and I found myself smiling and counting with the video. So, considering this big kid likes it, I think lots of little ones will as well.</p>
<p>[easyvideo video="<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/9fciD\_II7NI&amp;rel=0">http://www.youtube.com/v/9fciD\_II7NI&amp;rel=0</a>"]</p>
<p>Not only is it a pretty catchy tune, but the video is actually pretty awesome from a technical perspective. You'll notice that the entire two and a half minutes is essentially one video take. That's tricky by anyone's standards, more so given that she's interacting with puppets throughout the entire piece.</p>
<p>Also, compare the Sesame street video with the video for 1234.</p>
<p>[easyvideo video="<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/p8Z-DIAthbM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1">http://www.youtube.com/v/p8Z-DIAthbM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1</a>"]</p>
<p>There are some obvious stylistic similarities between the two, which is actually kind of cool that they integrated a few concepts into the Sesame Street piece.</p>
<p>Now I have that song stuck in my head. Hopefully you will too!</p>
