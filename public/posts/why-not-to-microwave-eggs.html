                <p>I was in a bit of a hurry this morning, so I thought I would save some time by using my microwave for a change. I cooked a few eggs up last night (hardboiled) so that I'd have a little snack in the fridge when I got hungry. But, unfortunately, cold hard boiled eggs just don't really do it for me. I figured -- why not just warm those puppies back up in the microwave before I eat them? Sounds like a good idea. So, I deshelled them and stuck two eggs in the microwave.</p>
<p>They weren't even in there that long really, just like 45 seconds. The first waited until I had opened the door to take him out, and then he exploded in a raining shower of egg pieces. It scared the shit out of me at first, and then I thought it was kind of funny. I was like "oh well, I'll just eat the other one." He was a little trickier that guy. He didn't explode at first - oh no, that would be too simple for his liking - instead, he waited until I picked him up, and then KABOOOM, steamy egg all over my shirt and counter.</p>
<p>So, I had a piece of toast for breakfast.</p>
<p>Apparently I'm not the only person to do this on the planet.</p>
