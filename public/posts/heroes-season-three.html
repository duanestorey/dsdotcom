                <p>Right now I'm on my second attempt at downloading Heroes, season three, episode three. I watched the first two last week, and I have to say that I wasn't overly impressed. There are a few plot holes going on that bother me, and I hope the shore up the writing a bit more in future episodes.</p>
<p>As I commented at the end of last season, Sylar is simply not a good bad guy anymore because he's almost invincible. The only person who can really challenge him is Peter, and we've seen that battle a few times now.</p>
<p>I'm still hoping this season will recreate some of the magic of the original season (in fact, the first part of season two was pretty good as well). I'll chime in in a few more episodes.</p>
