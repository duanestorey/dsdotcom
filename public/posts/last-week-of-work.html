                <p>Just waiting for a shirt to dry, and then I'm heading into the office for my last week of work. Hard to believe it's coming up so soon to be honest. I have a few meetings this week where I'll finalize the hand off on a few of my projects, and then I'm done.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night (two days!) I'll be heading out to Chilliwack and getting the keys for my new place. I haven't even really thought that far ahead yet, but somehow I'll end up out there and my car will stay there going forward. I haven't even really begun to pack yet, so this will be interesting. I'd like to take my laptop in to be fixed, but I can't really do without it currently, and they said they'd need it for a few days. Also, I plan to load my car up with electronics prior to driving out on Wednesday, so hopefully I'll have all my valuables out there (which reminds me -- I should probably transfer for contents insurance over). I'm also taking my car into work today and loading up five years worth of junk I've accumulated there.</p>
<p>Down to the wire. That's how I roll.</p>
