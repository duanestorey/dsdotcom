    <article class="main section content">
        <div class="container">
            <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2067/1810290508_40007e04ef.jpg?v=0" alt="Leaves" />A few weeks ago, after spending the weekend out in Hamilton, I stepped off the plane here in Vancouver and felt the brisk, cold air of a summer now long since past. It was a harsh reminder of how things change, and how fast time seems to move sometimes. It seems like just the other day I was celebrating my birthday back in April, and here we are, knee deep in October's gloominess.</p>
<p>Halloween is just around the corner. For me at least, it's not an event I particularly look forward to, and view at it as more of a nuisance as opposed to a day to celebrate. I expect I'll be out at the movies that night, or having a few beers at home. I've never been one for dressing up in costumes (although I have no problem going to something formal), although I appreciate that some people do. Last year around this time I was out in Toronto, hanging out backstage at Matt's Massey Hall show, and meeting some new friends for the first time.</p>
<p>Last night I went out to a little meetup down at the Two Parrots, and shared a pitcher of beer and some nachos with <a href="http://www.miss604.com">Rebecca</a> and a few others. Apparently the evening went rather late for most of them, but as for me, I packed up and headed home early as I was pretty beat. I spent the remainder of the evening parked in front of the TV, watching Love Actually (which is actually a really well-done romantic comedy), and thinking about the next few months.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2031/1911095829_f090205b19.jpg?v=0" alt="Christmas Tree" />As most people who know me already know, I have yet to take my Christmas tree down from last year. At first, I was just lazy, and didn't really get around to it. After a few months though, I sort of grew accustomed to having it in the corner, and just decided to leave it up. Truth is, the little four foot tree I have in the corner makes me smile whenever I look at it, and I just didn't have the heart to rip it down. Thankfully, Christmas is just around the corner, and it makes more sense to leave it up now than to disassemble it.</p>
<p>I've been struggling lately thinking about my future. After eight years of school and around the same amount of time working away in the high technology industry, I've sort of become disenchanted with the working world. I've felt, especially in the last year or so, that it was time for a change, but just can't seem to figure out what to do differently, or how to change things around. Unfortunately for me, the rather hefty student loan attached to my back severely limits what I can do at this point. But hopefully sometime in the near future I will finally pay it off, and then have the ability to make future decisions not on what I need to do, but rather what I want to do.</p>
<p>Change is, of course, usually scary and difficult, but from my personal experience, rarely turns out for the worse. Only time will tell where I ultimately end up, either out in Chilliwack in a little place on Cultus Lake, or maybe somewhere in Europe, curled up next to some cute girl reading a book. But I'm pretty certain that by this time next year things will be a lot different in my life, and I'm looking forward to that.</p>
