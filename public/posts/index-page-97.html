                I read about this when I woke up: Trans Fat Banned in NYC. I think that's pretty interesting actually. It opens up a lot of research opportunities since as far as I know it's the only place that's banned trans fat to such a large degree. I'm not sure I entirely agree with it though. I think most people know trans fat is bad, so I think putting it on the menu is good enough. Trans fat basically came about because the FDA thought it was super healthy years ago, and made everyone switch from animal...

                I'm such a big fan of Christmas. I don't know why, since most people tend to get a little grumpier, the malls are way busier, traffic is far more hectic -- yet somehow I always tend to get a little happier when my lights are up, or when I see presents under the tree.

                So, on Tuesday, December 5th, 24 Season Five comes out on DVD. I lost a few weeks to my life to the first four seasons, and plan to lose another week to this new season the moment it comes out. I'm pretty excited about it since it's supposed to be a pretty wicked season.

Hopefully they still have a few copies left at Future Shop when I get off of work on Tuesday....

It was actually not that bad of a movie (my second viewing I didn't think it was as good), and when I got home that weekend, I decided to watch Superman I and II again just to remember what they were like. And I have to say, I really enjoyed them (even though Chris says that makes me gay).

Well, its not exactly your typical Christmas Movie, but I like to watch Die Hard at least once a season, since it technically has some Christmas music in it. I wish they made movies like that nowadays. The last good action movie with the same spirit was probably True Lies, but everything else just takes itself a little too seriously.

The connection is complex, he says. But in fact, very rich people rate substantially higher in satisfaction with life than very poor people do, even within wealthy nations, he says.
"There is overwhelming evidence that money buys happiness," said economist Andrew Oswald of the University of Warwick in England. The main debate, he said, is how strong the effect is.

The "slouch" position revealed a reduction in spinal disk height, signifying a high rate of wear and tear on the lowest two spinal levels. Across all measurements, the researchers concluded that the 135-degree position fared the best. As a result, Dr. Bashir and colleagues advise patients to stave off future back problems by correcting their sitting posture and finding a...

Almost all cameras have light meters that are set up to try and make every scene around 18% grey. Some guy a long time ago looked around and realized that almost every real-world scene is made up of midtones, and these midtones are usually in the ballpark of 18%. So, whenever ...
