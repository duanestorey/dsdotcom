            <p>Ahh yes.. Friday.. So exciting.. This was a really good week. I hung out with friends, got some stuff done in the office, and have a pile of fun things to do this weekend. After work I'm meeting up with <a href="http://miss604.com">Rebecca</a>, Kasia and maybe <a href="http://www.keira-anne.com">Keira</a> for some wings and beer. Life's rough I know. Plus on the way over I want to buy a flash diffuser over at Leo's Camera on Granville, something that I used at the last wedding I shot and wished I actually owned.</p>
<p>Tomorrow there are two parties, one for Rebecca's birthday and one for Kasia's. I have to make appearances at both, but I think I can pull it off. And on Sunday is the beach photowalk I've been organizing. Should be a great time. I'll post some links to the photos once they start making their way onto Flickr.</p>
<p>I'm also listening to "Starts with One" by Shiny Toy Guns right now, and I have to say it's fairly kick ass.</p>
