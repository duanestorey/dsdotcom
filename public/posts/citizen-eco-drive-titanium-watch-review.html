                <p>I used to wear a watch all the time, probably since I was around 18 years old. My first watch was some tacky gold-plate Seiko that I took a fancy too around that age, but over the years I slowly upgraded to more stylish options. That changed around the time I purchased my first iPhone though, when I suddenly stopped wearing one. I guess at the time I figured wearing a watch was a bit redundant since my phone could show the time with just a single click of a button.</p>
<p>But last year I started noticing other guys wearing watches again, and I thought it looked sort of cool. I looked around my apartment for the last watch I had, thinking I would wear it again, but it turned out I managed to misplace it somehow during my travels.</p>

<p>But since it was a Citizen Eco-Drive titanium watch, I decided to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MKGPC0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005MKGPC0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=duanstor-20">go online and simply purchase another one</a>.</p>
<p>I've owned three Citizen titanium eco-drive watches, and I'm a big fan of the line and the build quality. Some guys like wearing big and heavy metal watches, but I'm not really one of them. I also don't really like leather straps, since I think they often look tacky. I eventually stumbled across a titanium eco-drive watch a few years ago, and loved how light it was. Every watch I have worn since then has been made of titanium, since it has all the benefits of a metal watch without the heavy weight of a typical stainless steel watch.</p>
<p>At this price point almost all of the Citizen Eco-drive watches have sapphire displays which are extremely strong and resistant to scratches. I've had my watch for over a year now and there isn't a single mark on the glass.</p>
<p>This watch is also resistant up to 100 metres, something that might be appealing to people who dive from time to time. As for me, I rarely go more than a meter or two into any body of water, but it's nice to know I can wear this watch into a pool or the shower whenever I want.</p>
<p>The entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-Drive">Eco-Drive</a> line by Citizen also doesn't require winding or a battery - it'll charge itself from the available light so you never have to worry about it. If you have one that's been in a box for a year or so and isn't working anymore, you can simply put it on and wear it outside for a little while until the battery charges again.</p>
<p>I've owned three Citizen Eco-Drive titanium watches now, and I'm been extremely happy with all three. They are lightweight thanks to the titanium, something that is really important to me due to all the travel I do, and basically care-free since they charge themselves. In addition I find all three Citizen Eco-Drive watches that I've owned to be stylish as well.</p>
<p>If you're looking to pick up a high-quality titanium watch, then I definitely recommend the <a href="http://amzn.to/1cz0a6T">Citizen Eco-Drive Titanium</a> watch - I currently own two of these myself and have had three in total over the years.</p>
