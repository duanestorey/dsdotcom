            <p>A few months ago, another event occurred that was intended to help raise money for the BC Children's Hospital Foundation. That event was the <a href="http://www.chipsnotdeadyet.com/">Chip's Not Dead Yet</a> memorial mile. Here's a little quote from the BC Children's Hospital Foundation as shown on the Chip's Not Dead Yet site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Chip’s Not Dead Yet Memorial Mile supports BC Children’s Hospital and the uphill battles faced by children who are trying to get well, and the medical staff who are trying to make miracles happen.</p>
<p>Children are precious and the most vulnerable members of our society. They rely on us to care for them.</p>
<p>We also know today that most of the common adult diseases find their origins in early childhood and by investing in the health of children we are investing in the future health of the entire population. Joining with Chip, we share the responsibility for seeing that nothing stands in the way of children achieving their full potential. I hope that you too can join us in our pursuit of giving every child a chance to live their life to the fullest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had the pleasure of attending one of the opening events for Chip's Not Dead Yet, and although I couldn't make it to the actual race, it was really great meeting everyone from the hospital and brainstorming some great social media strategies for fundraising. It was at that point I really decided that I would also support the BC Children's Hospital Foundation for Blogathon.</p>
<p>For more information on Chip's Not Dead Yet, please visit the <a href="http://www.chipsnotdeadyet.com/">official site</a>, or follow them <a href="http://twitter.com/chipsnotdeadyet">on Twitter</a>. If you'd like to support the BC Children's Hospital or my blogathon cause, please consider donating via one of my links, either below this post or in the sidebar. Thanks!</p>
