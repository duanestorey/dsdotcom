                <p>I was out visiting a friend in Maple Ridge last night, and had to drive back home as it was snowing. I haven't driven in the snow in a while, and frankly, my car kind of sucks at it. That being said, here are a few things I learned.</p>
<ul>
<li>Driving in near white-out conditions is never a good idea</li>
<li>The stock tires on a Mazda 3 Sport are complete garbage. Given that they are 17 inches, you might as well be driving a toboggan in the snow</li>
<li>When you blow a single tire, you should replace both at once, and not just one. My front right tire was replaced due to a blow out, and I had to get a different style. Unfortunately, it's about 10x better than the stock tires on my car, and it was gripping many times when they others weren't</li>
<li>When you can see the road better on your GPS than through your windshield, you should probably pull over and wait it out</li>
</ul>
