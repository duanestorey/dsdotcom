                <p>I was reading about the Rio Theatre and their liquor license issues over at <a href="http://www.miss604.com/2012/01/rio-theatre-alcohol-movies-wont-mix.html">http://www.miss604.com</a>. To summarize, the Rio theatre applied, and was granted, a liquor license for their movie theatre. Their intention was to have limited showings of movies where alcohol could be served to adults. The BC Liquor Control Board has now placed a restriction on the license which essentially means they can't use it to that effect anymore (not without cancelling regular movie screenings).</p>

<p>Many people know that I spent eight months of this last year traveling around the world. Without a doubt, BC (and Canada in general, if you exclude Quebec) has some of the most archaic and ridiculous liquor laws in the entire world. Here are a just a few examples from my travels of just how backwards we are in many regards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Movie theatres in Austin, Texas (and I imagine other parts of the US) can serve beer to patrons</li>
<li>In Thailand you can walk into a 7-11, buy a beer, and have the cashier open it for you (assuming you are just walking and not driving)</li>
<li>Movie theatres in New Zealand also have beer available to people watching movies. They'll even bring it to you in the theatre after you order it</li>
<li>You can buy liquor from normal convenience stores in Argentina, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the United States, and Uruguay. I suspect in many other countries too, but I haven't been to them yet. In addition the beer you buy is drastically cheaper than you'd pay in Canada, thanks to the heavy taxes we are charged.</li>
</ul>
<p>I fully support the Rio theatre's efforts to obtain a liquor license valid for shows. Given that a typical movie is two hours long and most people I've seen at movies drinking beer only have one, it doesn't really seem like a huge issue to me.</p>
<p>If you think so too, make sure you head on over to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SupportTheRio?sk=wall">Rio's Facebook page</a> and lend some support.</p>
