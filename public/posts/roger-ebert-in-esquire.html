                <p>I read a great story about Roger Ebert last night on the Esquire website. It's an article written by Chris Jones, and it's one of the better pieces I've read in quite a while, partially because I've been a long time reader of Roger's film reviews. Many people probably aren't aware of this, but Roger had a run in with cancer a few years ago, and ultimately lost not only his lower jaw in the process, but also his ability to speak.</p>
<p><img src="images/roger-ebert-jaw-cancer-photo-esquire-0310-lg.jpg" alt="Roger Ebert"></p>
<p>There's a great quote in the article from Roger Ebert (I believe it actually came from his blog), talking about how he feels about death:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know it is coming, and I do not fear it, because I believe there is nothing on the other side of death to fear. I hope to be spared as much pain as possible on the approach path. I was perfectly content before I was born, and I think of death as the same state. What I am grateful for is the gift of intelligence, and for life, love, wonder, and laughter. You can't say it wasn't interesting. My lifetime's memories are what I have brought home from the trip. I will require them for eternity no more than that little souvenir of the Eiffel Tower I brought home from Paris.</p>
</blockquote>
