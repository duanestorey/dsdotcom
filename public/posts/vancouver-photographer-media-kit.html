                <p>After playing with my photos this evening, I decided it was about time I put together my official media kit. As most people know, I've been fortunate enough to cover a lot of great events in the last year or so. Thankfully, it's a trend that seems to be continuing. With that in mind, I slapped together the first little bit of my <a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/media-kit">Media Kit</a> tonight. I also integrated the jQuery image gallery, which is pretty slick if you ask me.</p>
<p>I still have quite a bit to add, but it's slowly shaping up. If anyone sees anything I missed, please let me know.</p>
<p>Also, looks like <a href="http://www.martinafranko.com/">Martina Franko</a> (the olympic soccer player I did a photoshoot for last year) has a blog up, and she's covering the team's events in China right now. So head on over and take a look!</p>
