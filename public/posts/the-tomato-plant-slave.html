                <p>Yes, that's all I've become. I wake up, I go outside, my plants get mad at me, and I spend the morning watering them and looking after them.</p>
<p>For those who are just joining the saga, I planted a few tomato plants on my patio at the end of May. I've watched them grow, seen them fall down a few times, nursed them back to health, and in return, I've been rewarded by the growth of a pile of little tiny tomatoes.</p>

<p>One of the challenges with growing fruits and vegetables on your patio is that it's really hard to get them enough water, especially in this kind of heat. With a normal garden, you can soak the soil thoroughly such that the plants basically have a moisture reservoir. For a plant in a 12" pot though, there's really not too much you can do, other than water them twice a day or so, which is what I'm doing.</p>
<p>I'll try and post a few new photos later of my garden. The green peppers are about a week from being done, and my hot peppers are just changing colour now. I figure the Roma tomatoes are probably a month or so away, but the cherry tomatoes might be a bit sooner.</p>
