                <p>I woke up this morning and briefly turned my laptop on to check my email. After about ten minutes of cursing Leopard for not being able to connect to my wireless network I realized that the power was out in my building, which would explain why my wireless router was down (along with everyone else's). Apparently there was a memo about it, but I'm not so good with memos.</p>
<p>So, power is still down after four hours. I'm at an internet cafe on Davie grabbing a quick jolt of caffeine, and then am going to cruise around and buy a few small things I've been meaning to pick up (like some more glasses). Remeber to catch Rebecca tonight on CBC at 8pm. My mom said she's going to check in, so be cool like my mom and watch it.</p>
