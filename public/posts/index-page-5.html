Pretty much everything out there nowadays is full or both refined carbohydrates and sugar, often in the form of high fructose corn syrup. While complex carbohydrates aren't that bad for a person, anything that converts immediately into glucose (such as simple carbs and sugars) can cause l...

It's not always obvious, as evidenced by about 2 pounds worth of technology currently in my suitcase which I haven't made use of in a long time.
But one item that I've found practically indispensable is a portable external hard drive, especially since many of the new laptops (such as my...
