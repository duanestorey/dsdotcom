                <p>After setting up my RAID 5 array last night, I decided that maybe I would take a stab at self hosting my blog again. Up until two years ago, I had always run my blog from home. It's not really that hard to set up your own Apache server, and Linux can literally run for months or more without requiring a reboot. The downside of course is that home internet connections can be flaky, and most co-locations and hosting companies have UPS backup when things go wrong.</p>
<p>I recently upgraded my home fiber internet connection to a small business plan, so my internet connection at home is actually fairly insane -- I get 10mbps symmetric bandwidth, along with 140 GB of transfer each month. That's some serious shit.</p>
<p>I used to be on HostMonster, but recently switched over to Media Temple. Unfortunately, I haven't been very thrilled with the service I've been getting there. You can set up a lot of sites and host them on their grid server, but at least a few times a week lately my blog has been down, or it's just sat there with a "database connection error" for hours at a time. Without a doubt I can do a lot better than that with a machine at home.</p>
<p>So right now duanestorey.com is hosted in the corner of my living room, churning away happily on a quad core machine with 1TB of redundant storage. I tossed on a PHP op-code accelerator and tuned apache a bit, so it should be fairly smoking fast, assuming the fiber can keep up. I did a benchmark on Media Temple, and it could serve 12 requests per second. I tested my home machine here and it's around 130 requests per second, so we'll see how it goes.</p>
<p>Obviously the major downside is that if the machine crashes while I'm at work or away, then my blog will be down. I may just send automated mysql dumps over to Media Temple (since I still am keeping my account for other things), so I can remap my DNS if my blog at home falls over while I'm away. I don't think it will though.</p>
<p>PS - It's an absolute joy to use Wordpress when it's amazingly responsive</p>
