                <p>I had some of the weirdest dreams that I can remember in a long time last night. I went to bed at 10:30pm last night because I was so bagged, so maybe that has something to do with it.</p>
<p>I dreamt that I had to fly out to Timmins, Ontario this morning because I had to be in court. Some guy from high school was suing me for something and (despite both living here) the court date somehow ended up in Timmins. I bought a new suit for the event, but unfortunately I left it on the floor of the hotel room and showed up in court in my jeans. Some of my friends were flying out as character witnesses, but they were stuck at the airport.</p>
<p>Anyways, very strange. It's pretty rare I remember my dreams, so last night's definitely stood out.</p>
