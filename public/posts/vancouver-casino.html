                <p>Last night I had a few beers with the guys after work, and then headed down to Boneta to wish Victoria Potter a happy birthday. Then I scooted home, grabbed my camera, and went down to meet some friends at Plush near the Plaza of Nations.</p>
<p>I realized after waiting in line for about 5 minutes that I really don't enjoy clubs like that at all. Once inside, I just found the music and the people somewhat overbearing, so I left. Since the casino is basically across the way from Plush, I decided to head inside and play 30 minutes of blackjack.</p>
<p>I haven't been to a casino in a long time. Rebecca and I walked through a few when we were down in Las Vegas last June, but neither of us were interested in playing.</p>

<p>I know pretty much for certain that Blackjack is pretty much the only game there where the odds aren't incredibly stacked against the player. If I remember right, the house only has a 0.5% advantage if you play straight up. That is, if you play 12 hands and hour, and the bets are $5 each, you'll lose on average about $3/hour, which isn't really that bad considering it's just entertainment.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that I played for about two hours, and only lost about $5 I think. During that time, pretty much everyone at the table went through hundreds of dollars, and most of them walked away empty. Which is why I found it so strange how many people were giving me advice on how to play my hands. I guess everyone thinks they are the next millionaire.</p>
<p>Anyways, it was a nice change. I just woke up here. Once I'm done breakfast I'm going to do a bit of work and then maybe go outside and shoot some photos.</p>
