                <p>I'm pretty bagged, so this will be short. The flight leaving Heathrow was pretty much a complete clusterfuck. Apparently they were out of gates, so they just parked the 747 on the concrete a mile away and had to shuttle us all there in small groups.. We took off around an hour late.. About an hour into it, we had some pretty wicked turbulence, which for someone who hates flying basically unnerved me.</p>
<p>I popped a few sleeping pills when we hit altitude and managed to sleep for most of the flight home (surprisingly, because I had an aisle seat, and nobody asked me to get up so they could go to the bathroom).. We landed in Vancouver around 8pm I think... I missed my wine drinking time by about an hour, but just had my second glass here... I left my place a completely disaster, so I guess I have to wake up and do some cleaning..</p>
<p>I'm so hungry I briefly debated eating some of the Becel margerine in my fridge (since that's basically all I have).. Instead, I think I'll go for a walk and get a slice of pizza or poutine or something.</p>
<p>That's it for me.. Will post more tomorrow..</p>
