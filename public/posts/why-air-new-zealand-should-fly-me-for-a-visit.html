            <p>Air New Zealand is having a contest now where they'll fly the winner from Canada to New Zealand. I think I'm the perfect guy to go, so I wanted to detail a few of the reasons why.</p>
<p><img src="images/Auckland_-_Skyline.jpg" alt="New Zealand" /></p>
<ol>
<li>I have a good friend in New Zealand (Belinda) that I haven't seen since high school!</li>
<li>I've had a few photos published by other airlines, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/1270344623/">namely Air Transat</a>, and would love to take some photos of New Zealand</li>
<li>I can work from anywhere, even a New Zealand pub. People need to know what the WiFi is like, and I can share it with them</li>
<li>I'm a 5'9" tall hobbit, three times removed from Frodo</li>
<li>After reading Lord of the Rings when I was 12, I briefly wore a ring around my neck</li>
<li>I've always wanted to <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2b/Whale_Rider_movie_poster.jpg">ride a Whale</a>; I hear New Zealand is the place for that.</li>
<li>It's my calling in life to share New Zealand beer drinking experiences with Canadians back home</li>
<li>I've always wanted to learn MƒÅori. Well, not always, but recently</li>
<li>I pack light, that means I'll buy more souvenirs</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully Air New Zealand will stumble upon this post and realize that I'm the best Canadian for the job. To notify me that I'm the winner, please email me at <a href="mailto:bringthehobbithome@duanestorey.com">BringTheHobbitHome@DuaneStorey.com</a>.</p>
