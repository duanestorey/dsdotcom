    <article class="main section content">
        <div class="container">
            <p>Where to begin. I actually had thought that the last post I did would be my final one before taking the website down and completely revamping it. But a couple things happened tonight while sitting on my couch that inspired me to write one final one before retooling the website.</p>
<p>Lately I really feel like I'm entering into the next phase of my life. Maybe it's turning 30 soon, or maybe it's all the events that happened over the last few months, but I've spent the last few months trying to figure a lot of things out. And to be honest, I haven't had much luck with it all. But some things I know I want to change.</p>
<p>For instance, I'm probably going to move out of the downtown core soon. Sure it's nice to walk to work, but other than that, there's not much benefit to being down here. I don't particularly enjoy most of the people I meet in my area, and I don't really care for most of the establishments. I think I'm just starting to realize I'm more of a small town kind of guy, and the big city life isn't really my thing.</p>
<p>To be honest, lately I've found myself rather sad and lonely. It's discouraging when you feel like you're a good person, and yet people consistently treat you poorly. I go out of my way to keep in touch with friends, and most of them don't return the favour. I email people inviting them to hang out and do things, and quite often, none of them email back. And I find all that rather depressing, especially at this point in my life.</p>
<p>So, while sitting on my couch alone tonight, feeling a bit bummed that I was sitting on my couch alone tonight, I got an email out of the blue from someone that read my blog. And here's some of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>.... Anyway, I admit, I poked around your blog a bit more because for some odd reason I get interested in reading blogs of people I don't know. I guess I just like to see how they write and find out if anyone else goes through the same life pains (which of course they do, and then suddenly the world feels a little cozier).</p>
<p>I guess I just wanted to say hi to a nice sounding guy. Keep being you (sorry if that sounds cheesy, I'm not sure how else to say it). Although, I can't quite understand how such a sweet and cute looking guy can also look so sad at the same time. There is a very intriguing mystery in your eyes.</p>
<p>I read about your eye and that story nearly made me cry. How terrible! And you were only being a good guy. I hope you're recovering well. You seem to have a good attitude about it all.</p>
<p>...I think random encounters can be as delightful yet fleeting as a shooting star. Hopefully this little blip is a bright spot for you, not a dark one. Feel free to drop by the blog any time, although I'm on a bit of strike right now (it's a long story, but I think I'll come back in a few days).</p>
<p>Wishing you all the best</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it made me feel alot better. It's nice to know that there are other good people in the world, people who care enough to send heart-felt emails to strangers, or <a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/index.php/archives/153">mail $20 worth of beer money across the country</a> to someone they've never met. So much of this world is messed up right now, and with the current pace of life, the real beauty and magic in this world can sometimes pass us by with barely a fleeting glance out the side window.</p>
<p>So, thanks for writing, and thanks for helping make my world a little brighter.</p>
