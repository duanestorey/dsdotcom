                <p>I work in a big highrise downtown, which means I have the pure joy of dealing with the elevator system whenever I need to go anywhere. For whatever reason you can only take the stairwell in our building on the way down. Considering we're only on the third floor, the inability to walk up a few flights of stairs is a big pain in the ass.</p>
<p>One of the things you notice after a while is that some people invariably lose their bearings whenever they enter an elevator while others do not (the confusing part is we have a bank of elevators, and sometimes you end up in one of the south side of the building, while other times it can be on the north side). In my case, I seem to always know what direction I'm heading in when I leave the elevators, which makes me enjoy watching those people who never seem to (and subsequently start walking in the wrong direction upon leaving the elevator).</p>
<p>Anyone else have any elevator stories?</p>
