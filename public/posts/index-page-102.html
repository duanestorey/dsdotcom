                So there's this buzz amongst photographers about this new technique called HDR (high dynamic range). The basic idea is that a camera isn't capable of capturing nearly as much dynamic range as what our eyes can capture.? With HDR, you take multiple shots of the same scene using a digital camera on a tripod, and create a new photograph using the information from all the shots. That new image contains a much larger dynamic range than would be possible using any one shot.
Here are some cool examples...

The first thing I hate is that the battery is always dead. It doesn't matter how often I charge it, or how much care I take in shutting it off when I'm not using it, it always seems to be almost dead whenever I pick it up to do anything. Part of my morning routine involve...

I woke up in a hotel in Invermere, BC, at around 9am, seriously hungover and in a hurry to get back to Vancouver. I really wasn't looking forward to the nearly ten hour drive to get back, especially considering that I have to work again in the morning.

I had a really cool time in the Rockies. I left Wednesday and made it as far as Golden BC the first night. Camping there wasn't very...

I can honestly say that Central Park was the one part of New York I wasn't prepared to see. Here in Vancouver, we talk about Stanley Park like it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. And don't get me wrong, it is beautifu...
