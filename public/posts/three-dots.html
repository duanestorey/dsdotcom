                <p>Ahh yes, the end of a long weekend. And not just any long weekend, the last long weekend of the summer. So long summer of 2009, it was nice to know you.</p>
<p>My niece and nephew head back to school tomorrow, which is sort of exciting for them. I always liked going back to school for some reason. Maybe it was buying a whole new batch of school supplies, or seeing some of your friends again after a summer apart. Granted, after about a week I was sick of the new year, but that first week was usually fun.</p>
<p>As for me, I took it pretty easy this weekend. I was originally supposed to go camping, but opted out of that at the last minute due to weather. Instead, I cleaned my apartment, moved a few things around, and ate most of my meals from the comfort of home. Tonight I even roasted a chicken and tried making some zucchini/goat-cheese appetizers that Dale told me about.</p>
<p>This upcoming weekend is the Canadian Country Music Awards in Vancouver. Despite having a media pass, I think I'm going to take a pass and skip the event. Truthfully, I just have a bit too much on my plate, and know that if I go next weekend I'll be playing catch-up for weeks afterwards.</p>
<p>My main focus right now is preparing for my WordCamp Portland presentation that's rapidly approaching. For some reason I thought I'd be only speaking for a half-hour, but turns out I have a full-hour slot, which means I need to add a pile of more content to my presentation. So I'll be spending most evenings this week doing research and trying to flesh it out a bit more. Next weekend I'll spend a bit of time going through it from front to back, so hopefully I'll be ready before the event. I don't think I've ever given a full hour-long presentation before, so we're definitely in uncharted waters.</p>
<p>Other than that, it's a fairly busy month work-wise. Thankfully we have nothing really on our plate for October, so we're going to take a bit of a breather and relax after September.</p>
<p>PS - Not really sure why, but ever since I started taking a few vitamins a few weeks ago, I've found myself super hot most of the time. I know it's not menopause, but even with the A/C on as low as it goes I'm pretty warm.</p>
