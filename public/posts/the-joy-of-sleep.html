                <p>Lately I've actually been sleeping fairly well, given how much trouble I have routinely had in the past. I've been trying to keep a fairly consistent schedule these days, going to bed sometime around midnight, and trying to be up around 8am or so. There's a period of time between about 7 and 8 in the morning that is pure bliss these days, where I just kind of fade in and out of sleep and stretch periodically. Now that it's a bit colder, my heater is on slightly, so my room is nice and toasty at the point. Plus, it's still a bit dark at that hour, which makes it easier to continue relaxing.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I'm not really looking forward to the upcoming time change this weekend. It'll mean that my one hour of joy each morning there will be interrupted with sunshine, which will probably make it harder to continue sleeping. That being said, I'm still looking forward to being a lazy bum this weekend and sleeping in on both days. I have to take my car into the shop on Saturday to finally get my replacement stereo installed.</p>
