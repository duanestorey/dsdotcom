                <p>Surprisingly, I have never seen this before.. It's an old opening scene from Star Wars: A New Hope. I thought it was a complete fake at first, but it looks like it was real footage that was intended to be included at one point.</p>
<p>What's weird is that it's sort of processed and seems to have been scored, which is unusual for anything that hits the cutting room floor. Possibly some fan added some Star Wars music to those scenes, but the music fits rather nicely which sort of makes me think it was in the movie up until the last minute.</p>
<p>I'm having a small HD-DVD movie marathon at my pad tomorrow. Should be fun.</p>
