                <p>I had a really good time in Seattle last night. On my way back from my big walking adventure, I saw a pub called "The Blarney Stone" and basically had to stop by to have one drink out of honour of my home town. While sitting at the pub, I tried my first (and probably last) Strongbow beer. If you haven't had one, you definitely should at least once.. It sort of tastes like apple juice on steroids.</p>
<p>It was here that I ran into Sara and Alec and started my drinking adventure of the evening. I had made dinner plans with a friend around 8pm, so we did a pretty good job of drinking until then.. At that time, I met Lynn down at Amber Lounge and had some appetizers and some drinks. Afterwards I called Sara and Alec (who had given me their numbers) and managed to get everyone together on some hill around here (Capital Hill?).</p>
<p>I woke up this morning wishing I would have stopped drinking around 9pm or so, but I definitely had a good time. I originally was going to hop in the car and head to Oregon, but decided that I was rather comfy in this hotel and extended my reservation one more day. Tomorrow I'll hit the road again and see where I end up.</p>
