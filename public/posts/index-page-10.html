                Well, after nearly 13 years, I'm finally back home. It's been quite the rollercoaster ride really, looking back over that period of time. I left Chilliwack back when I was 18 years old to attend university. When I graduated, I moved myself across the country and spent a few years in Ottawa working in the high-tech sector out there. Then I moved back home and did a bit more school, and finally ended up at CounterPath, where I have spent the last five years working away.
The move was pretty uneven...

                CNN posted some videos from the Airbus plane that ditched into the Hudson the other day. Ditching is actually a fairly common practice for military aircraft, obviously less common for passenger aircraft. To pull of a successful ditch, you basically have to have a perfect landing such that the wings don't dip and hit the water. Thankfully the pilot pulled it off, and every single person survived this incident (which is rare for a commercial passenger jet).

                I left Vancouver yesterday afternoon to head into Chilliwack and pick up the keys to my new apartment. On the way, I stopped and met a really old friend of mine from high-school, and we had a few beers and a plate of nachos. I have to say, it was a rather strange feeling being in my apartment all alone after the landlord left. I sort of just stared around at the empty apartment, trying to digest just how I felt. Without a doubt, I am excited. I am definitely looking forward to what the next year...

Tickets are still available, so if you'd like to come, make sure you sign up now. Included in the price of a ticket is a full day of WordPress and social media related talks, lunch, a few drinks at the social event, and a piece of one-of-a-kind WordPress schwag.

                Well, last night was interesting, to say the least. For those of you who follow around here, about a year ago I decided to host my blog from home instead of on some shared hosting account. My main reason for doing that was that I had been through around 3 shared hosting providers that year, and all of them had let me down on more than one occasion. So I figured I could do it better myself.
Which was true to an extent. However last night, while I was packing boxes near the server, I guess I accid...

Somehow someone found where they were on my server, and sure enough, I've been providing the bandwidth for a lot of happy viewers somewhere over the last few days. Novus emailed me last night and told me I was up to 100GB worth of traffic already this month, which is obviously fairly steep.

It also reminded me how much I'm going to miss all the people I've gotten to know in Vancouver. But hopefully I'll be out here from time to time, or people will come visit me once and a while.
Only a few more days. Still looking forward to it. Gotta start packing soon though....

Somehow I busted my hand open trying to stop myself from falling, and I bruised my shoulder pretty bad. I woke up with dried blood on my hand this morning, so I must have whacked it pretty good.

                Jeff Pulver is not only one of the original pioneers of voice over IP (VoIP), but also a really great individual who dedicates himself to technology and meeting all the people involved in it. I first met Jeff in the lounge of the Fairmont San Jose where him, Erik Lagerway and myself all sat around drinking one night years ago. If I remember correctly, Jeff picked up the tab that night, so I definitely owe him a few beers.
Jeff will be up in Vancouver on the 10th and 11th of January. If you're ar...

                It seems that after eight years of university I've acquired a fairy large array of engineering books. Since I haven't read any of them in years, I figure I might as well sell a few of them off. Here's a list of some of them. If you're interested, drop me a comment. Also, please feel free to forward this list on to any physics or electrical engineering students.

                On Monday I made the trek to Chilliwack out from Vancouver. The timing was actually perfect, since the roads were fairly bare when I left Vancouver, and are now pretty clogged up with snow. It's been snowing off and on here in Chilliwack, but at least driving around is feasible. The forecast is currently calling for rain for the next few days, followed by more snow probably on Monday. That basically means I'll be making the journey back into Vancouver sometime this weekend, hopefully before the ...

                So, I had to wear a pulse oximeter over the weekend and ended up back in Burnaby this morning to go over the data recorded by the machine. The final verdict is that I have a mild form of sleep apnea, which basically means that I stop breathing from time to time during the night, and it usually causes enough stress on my body to make me to wake up so that I can breathe.
Given that I've had high blood pressure most of my life, and that high blood pressure is often a symptom of sleep apnea, it's po...

It's been going on for so long that I can't even remember if there was a time when I used to sleep soundly or not. I often wake up every hour or so and feel rather anxious, and most nights it takes me at least an hour to nod off. It could be the traffic or some sound that wakes me, but I've never really been sure.

Two main factors led the Board to raise the CD levy rate to 29¢. First, the mechanical royalties that record labels pay to record a song onto a prerecorded CD have increased. Second, because consumers now use compression t...

                For two years in a row now, I've missed out on going to SxSW. For those of you who don't know what it is, it's pretty much the largest technology / music conference in North America, and it happens once a year down in Austin, Texas. Last year, while watching everyone talk about it online, I decided that I would go this year and check it out.
That being said, I still haven't done anything about it, nor am I entirely sure I could afford to go to it (although I *do* have a pre-paid flight ticket in...

                I meant to post this earlier, but I've just been slammed these last few days. Today is a special day, as it's the birthday of two of my good friends.
The first is Arieanna, who I've been lucky enough to get to know a lot better over the course of this last year. The first time I really hung out with her was at the 2008 Canadian Juno Awards in Calgary, where her and I crashed a VIP party and proceeded to drink our weight in beer. Good times.

The second birthday is of course Keira-anne's. One of ...

                I just read this article which talks about how the executives at Ford are willing to cut their salaries to $1 if they receive money from the federal government. Wow, that's nice of them.
Notably absent in that entire article is a mention of executive bonuses. Bonuses and dividends are typically taxed as investments instead of income, and usually result in a smaller tax burden. In Canada, the tax rate on dividends is roughly half of what it is in regular income, so that's the preferred method of ...

More likely is that I do nothing though and simply let it work itself out naturally.

                For the past few months, I really haven't been sleeping that well. Typically that means I sleep in a little later than normal, and am always pushing it getting to work on time. On a lot of days that usually means I end up taking a cab to work. So over the last few months, I've gotten to understand a lot of what makes a good cab driver in Vancouver. Here's a brief list of five must-have things that most Vancouver cab drivers have:

                This is one of the most tragic things I've read in a very long time. Shoppers at a WalMart were so eager to get through the doors for today's sale that they literally stomped one of the workers there to death. Even while he was down, people still trampled past him, with nobody stopping to help him up or make sure he was ok. Another worker also hit the ground, as did a pregnant lady.
I really have to question what type of world we live in where something like that can happen. It's one thing at a ...

I dreamt that I had to fly out to Timmins, Ontario this morning because I had to be in court. Some guy from high school was suing me for something and (despite both living here) the court date somehow ended up in Timmins. I bought a new suit for the event, but unfortunately I left it on the floor of the hotel room...

                Strange night, yes indeed. I met a few work people for some drinks down at Hapa Izakaya on Robson. I went with the intention of not only abstaining from eating crappy, unhealthy food, but also for drinking booze. I did fairly well on both fronts, and basically shadowed everyone around all night. We ended up at the Morrisey in Vancouver, and just chilled out there for a while.
Near the end of the night, when most people from work had left, my friend Derek and I were just chilling out and thinking...

I have a queen sized bed, but only own one pillow. It makes sleeping strange. 2) I drink way too much diet pepsi, and usually have an empty bottle somewhere in every room 3) I typically buy the same thing whenever I'm at the store. That explains why I have four jars of salsa in my fridge, three ...

We are working on that [fully electric cars], but let me just share with you the Ford plan about that. Our No. 1 priority is to improve the internal combustion engine, and that's why the turbocharging, the direct fuel injection, we get a 20 percent improvement in fuel mileage and a 15 p...

I ran into Ianiv in the mall, and we ended up chatting for a bit. One of the things I've been debating for quite some time now is moving out of the downtown core. My first choice is somewhere on the North Shore, hopefully fairly close to the Seabus (since I work downtown). Whenever I'm out that way, it...

There's a lot I could say about today, but browsing around the Vancouver web it seems others have already said it for me. But I'm obviously thankful for the sacrifices others made so that we can enjoy the freedoms we have today.

                I met with Rebecca and John tonight and we started finalizing the plans for WordCamp Whistler. We're hoping to nail down a venue in the next week or so, at which time we'll open up official registration. Given that we want to make the event as awesome and as interesting as possible, we're going to be charging a small admission for the event. In addition, we'll also be accepting sponsorship from a few organizations, which will hopefully cover the costs of the venue, and the social.
Stay tuned in ...

                I sat down right now to write a blog entry, and this is the one I came up with. There have been numerous entries on various websites over the last few weeks that have hinted that blogging is dead. While I don't necessarily believe them, I can't help but see some truth in a few of their statements.
First, let it not be forgotten that the *ability* to blog is at an all time maximum. Thanks to the work of Automattic and WordPress, it's relatively painless to start a blog, either on WordPress.com or...

I did something similar in Feburary of this year for Northern Voice, and I thought it would be a good idea to try again. Given that Barack Obama was one of the first presidential candidates to embrace social media, I thought I'd do a celebratory mosaic using a public photos posted to Flickr.

The image is constructed using Flickr photos from everyday, normal people, the same people who helped Obama and his grass-roots campaign to secure the presidency. The search tags used on Flickr were "obama...

It's been a few days now since president-elect Barack Obama won the election, and I thought I would share a few thoughts. The day of the election I saw an interview with a prominent African American on CNN who said that should Obama win, you would literally be able to divide the history of the United States into two time periods: the period before Obama, and the period after. He said from that moment on, you would no longer be able to say that certain things were not possible in the US if you w...

                On September 11th, 2001, I was working in the middle of a clean room in a tiny building somewhere in the middle of Ottawa. Upon walking down the hall, I learned from a co-worker that a plane had just struck the World Trade Center. Thinking it was just an accident, I continued on with my job without any more thought to the event. Upon learning that another plane had hit the second World Trade Center building less than an hour later, I began to realize the magnitude of the day's events.

                It's finally here. After over a full year of campaigning, tomorrow the United States will be voting on who will be the next president of the United States. As I've blogged about many times before, I'm hoping Barack Obama wins. Compared to most politicians in this day and age, he seems upfront, humble, intelligent, and with an honest desire to improve the state of America.
I'm probably going to hole myself up tomorrow near a TV and watch the coverage as it happens. Without a doubt, this is bound ...

                A few weeks ago, after spending the weekend out in Hamilton, I stepped off the plane here in Vancouver and felt the brisk, cold air of a summer now long since past. It was a harsh reminder of how things change, and how fast time seems to move sometimes. It seems like just the other day I was celebrating my birthday back in April, and here we are, knee deep in October's gloominess.
Halloween is just around the corner. For me at least, it's not an event I particularly look forward to, and view at ...

One of the best uses of QR codes in my mind involves the inclusion of QR code hyperlinks in printed media. That way a user could be reading a poster or a paper version of an article and still be able to navigate hyperlinks using their...

                Well, I made it. The flight was, for the most part, uneventful. I actually had to stop in Edmonton briefly which was unexpected. That being said, it got me off the plane for 20 minutes to stretch and get a bit of sunshine, which was nice.
In fact, it was one of the most enjoyable flights in a while. I spent most of it reading a book I picked up in the Vancouver airport called "From Good To Great" which methodically investigated the top 11 companies in the last 30 years to see what they did diffe...

Happy Birthday John!...

                So, this in this day and age this is probably a rhetorical post. I imagine most guys wear boxer shorts these days, and I typically do as well. That being said, I couldn't find any that were clean this morning so I was forced to put on a pair of briefs that were hiding in my closet.
Surprisingly, they are far comfier than I remembered. It sort of feels like I've just reunited with an old childhood friend. Even though that friend is going to go away as soon as the laundry machine spins back up, it...

                I spent yesterday mostly sitting around and watching movies, which was a nice change from the norm. I also started work on a new BuddyPress Chat plugin that will allow user-user chatting, similar to Facebook style. When I was down in San Francisco at WordCamp, I told Andy Peatling that I really wanted to contribute something to BuddyPress if I could, so I thought a chat feature might be a cool feature.
I still have a ways to go, but I have the code which takes a user from "Offline" to "Online" c...

                There were a few birthdays last month that I sort of missed in terms of blog entries. I do my best to get them all, but sometimes my schedule gets the best of me.
The first birthday was my step-mom, Cathy's. Cathy's been an important person in my life ever since I was a little kid, and she's still there to help out today.

And the other birthday was John Bollwitt, who recently celebrated the big three-oh.

Happy (belated) birthday guys....

                Right now I'm on my second attempt at downloading Heroes, season three, episode three. I watched the first two last week, and I have to say that I wasn't overly impressed. There are a few plot holes going on that bother me, and I hope the shore up the writing a bit more in future episodes.
As I commented at the end of last season, Sylar is simply not a good bad guy anymore because he's almost invincible. The only person who can really challenge him is Peter, and we've seen that battle a few time...
