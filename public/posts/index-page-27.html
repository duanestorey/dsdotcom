                Ah yes, here we are. Given that we're only four days away from Christmas, I'm starting to think that maybe I should do some of my Christmas shopping. I'm a pretty big shopping procrastinator though, so I imagine it'll be down to the wire. Strangely enough, I haven't really gotten into the Christmas mood yet, which is rather unusual given how much I enjoy Christmas.
Last Christmas I ended up working through most of the holidays, so this year I've decided to take it easy and enjoy a bit of downtim...

                It's one of those questions that everyone always asks you at parties -- what do you do? I guess the normal answer is to tell people what you do for a living, which in my case would currently be web development. That being said, some people tend to tell people what they are trained to do. For example, if you have a CA, you'd say you're an accountant, or if you have a mechanical engineering degree, you'd say you're a mechanical engineer.

                Without a doubt, shooting in low-light conditions is one of the most challenging aspects of taking photographs. I would still probably rate weddings a bit more challenging (since most weddings include some elements of low-light in addition to outdoor shots), but it's definitely near the top of my difficulty scale.
With the advent of digital cameras, most SLR bodies now have the ability to allow the user to arbitrarily increase the ISO setting on the camera in order to improve the low-light respo...
