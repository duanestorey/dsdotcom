                <p><img src="../assets/posts/2009/4196227660_af82e022e9.webp" alt="" />Courtney Summers is an author of young adult books and also a client of BraveNewCode's; we've been really fortunate to work with her a few times and help her out with a few iterations of her website.</p>
<p>A few months ago I was joking on Twitter with Courtney that it would be cool if she found a way to put me in her next book. Well, Courtney got the final version of her book to proof last night, and sure enough, she managed to sneak me in.</p>
<p>As you can see, there's a character in her new book, <a href="http://courtneysummers.ca/novels/some-girls-are/">Some Girls Are</a>, named Duane Storey. I can finally scratch "being a character in a young adult book targeted at young teenage girls" off of my bucket list!</p>
<p>So thanks Courtney! It's really cool. Head on over to Courtney's site <a href="http://courtneysummers.ca/novels/some-girls-are/">to find out more about her new book</a></p>
