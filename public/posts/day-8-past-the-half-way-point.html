                <p>Quick update. Right now Rebecca and John are in the air, or about to land. This is officially day 8 here for me, which means there are fewer days ahead than there are behind. We're all having a great time here, and have spent most of our days reading and swimming by the pool.</p>

<p>The other night I ventured off the resort and ended up at the Hard Rock cafe in Punta Cana. I met up with a few Vancouverites and we all went to a dance club until about 5am or so in the morning. I stumbled back into my room around 6am, and passed out for the better part of the day. That was the first night I hit the sauce, and I definitely paid for it the next day. Other than that, I've hardly really touched any alcohol down here, other than one or two by the pool from time to time.</p>
<p>For those who know me, I typically always get a bit antsy when I'm away from home. This time I've actually been pretty content, probably because I brought enough books to read and have been taking it pretty easy. I imagine at the end of next week I'll be ready to head home though and eat some home cooked meals again. But for now, we're all having a good time.</p>
