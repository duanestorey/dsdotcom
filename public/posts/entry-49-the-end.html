                <p>Well, thus ends Blogathon 2009 - it was quite the adventure, one that I'm glad I was a part of again. The official Blogathon website shows approximately $40,000 raised for the various charities this weekend, which is totally awesome. Of that amount, approximately $1,250 was raised by the content on this blog, and by the people who supported my efforts and the BC Children's Hospital Foundation. So once again, you guys all have my sincerest thanks.</p>
<p>But while the donations and money are obviously appreciated, this event is about more than money. It's about a group of people banding together to make a difference. And for that, every blog or person that was a part of blogathon helped make a difference.</p>
<p>So with that, I bid you all adieu. I'm packing up, grabbing a cab, and hopefully spending the better part of the afternoon sleeping. Thanks again everyone.</p>
