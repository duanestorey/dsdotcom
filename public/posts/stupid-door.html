                <p>Last night I decided to go down to the little store downstairs and get myself something to drink. As I was leaving my apartment, I realized that for some weird reason I couldn't lock my door from the outside. Locking it from the inside is difficult, but not impossible. But I can't for the life of me manage to lock it from the outside.</p>

<p>So basically, I'm stuck at home until I can figure out a way to get it fixed. The obvious answer is to call a locksmith and get him/her to come fix it. But it's Sunday, which probably means it's going to be a major pain in the ass to sort out. I've been trying to get a hold of my landlord to ask him what he wants me to do, but he's disappeared as well.</p>
<p>It's such a nice day out today too, and I've been stuck inside on the couch watching the sun go down and listening to all the joggers and rollerbladers heading for the seawall. I'm going to attempt to take it apart myself and see if I can figure out what's wrong, but it really feels like something is broken inside so I'm not getting my hopes up.</p>
<p>** update - I called a locksmith, and they want $600 - $800 to come today to fix it. So, I guess I'm stuck at home until tomorrow. I'm lucky I don't have surgery tomorrow, or I'd be screwed.</p>
