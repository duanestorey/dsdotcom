                <p>I was talking to a few people on the weekend about this current iteration for my theme, and it seems there's enough interest that I might eventually set this up as a download, or add it to the WordPress theme repository. But, I'd like a bit more input from some photographers about features I can potentially add.</p>
<p>One thing I was thinking of incorporating was a stand-alone microstock service. For example, beside each photo there would be a "Buy" button that would take you to PayPal. Once you paid your $5 or whatever, you'd get an email with a large version of the photo and a license to use the photo. Still thinking about how that would work, but I think it would be a useful feature, and I've always wanted to write a plugin that interfaces with PayPal.</p>
<p>Some other things I'd like to integrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Somehow incorporate Flickr photo comments, which was the original reason I wrote Crossroads years ago</li>
<li>Have the ability to display Flickr sets in blog posts -- basically, after I'm done a photoshoot, I want the Flickr set to tell the story instead of me having to manually write a big blog entry</li>
<li>Right now the title tags don't really do anything on the single photo pages -- I have to somehow come up with a way to inject information about the current photo into each page, without breaking popular plugins like the All In One SEO pack.</li>
<li>My main photography page is a bit too static for my liking. I'd like a section at the top that shows my recent photo activity, or something that changes fairly often to encourage people to browse through it</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything else that would be awesome from a photographer's point of view?</p>
