                <p>So last night I headed down to the Alibi room for Keri's 29th birthday party. I got the official invite via a myspace bulletin a while ago, and slotted it into my calender. The piece I apparently forgot I guess was the "RSVP via Email" thing at the bottom. So tonight, I got all dolled up, and headed down there for 10pm. Only problem was nobody else was there.. So, I got myself a drink, and waited. After an hour I realized there were a few holes in my original plan.. Unfortunatley, my cell phone was recently fixed, and I don't have many numbers in there yet, so I had no way to contact any of the people who were going to be there.. After waiting nearly another hour (which wasn't totally boring because I was chatting it up with the cute female bartender and sampling their wines), I realized the birthday wasn't happening, for me at least. So I headed home, found a phone number I needed, and called to find out where everyone was. Apparently there were all next door to where I was.</p>
<p>Oh well. Live and learn I guess.</p>
<p>In other news, congrats to Jeff and Michele who, after 14 hours of labour, just gave birth to little baby Mia. I'm gonna head down to the hospital in a bit and try to take a few photos of the happy new family.</p>
