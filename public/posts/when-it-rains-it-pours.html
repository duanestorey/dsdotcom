<p>A few days ago, I mentioned that <a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/index.php/archives/159">Kate's fiance was going to give me a second opinion about my injury</a>. The official word back was that yes, I do have a orbital floor fracture in addition to a tripod fracture. I sent his opinion to my plastic surgeon, and he eventually agreed that I do have one and that it should also be fixed. Which raises sort of an interesting question -- how did the two or three doctors that looked at me initially not see this?</p>
<p>I managed to get a hold of the plastic surgeon I was dealing with at the hospital, and talked it over with him. He's sending me to an eye specialist tomorrow (Wed) to see if there's actually anything wrong with my eye that could be causing me problems. This is sort of a formality, and everyone is expecting that to come back ok. Depending on the results of that test, I'm tentatively going in for reconstructive surgery on Thursday to repair the damage to the orbital floor under my eye and the breaks in my cheekbone.</p>
<p>So, while I'm glad things are moving in the right direction, and in another week or so this should all be behind me, it's not without its costs. First, I have to miss my trip to Mexico, since I'll be in no condition to travel for a while. I was really looking forward to going and seeing my friend Bob get married, spending some time on the beach, and just relaxing from a hard year of work, so I'm obviously a bit bummed about that. Second, the tickets to Mexico are non-refundable and non-transferable, so I'm out $2100. I guess it's the one time I could have used cancellation insurance, but I always think &quot;geez, I travel all the time, what could possibly happen that would make me cancel my trip?&quot; And third, the specialist appointment tomorrow is the only time slot available for quite a while, so basically I have to go. The only problem is it's immediately before my graduation ceremony at UBC, so there's a chance I may not make it to my ceremony on time. And after four years of hard work getting my masters degree, it would really disappoint me if I miss the ceremony.</p>
<p>So what can I say. When it rains, it really does pour sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>update - it's official, I'm going for surgery Thursday at 9am. Wish me luck.</strong></p>
