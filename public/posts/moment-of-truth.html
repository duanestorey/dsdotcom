                <p>On Wednesday, I'll get to meet Dr. Peter Dolman, who is one of the best ocuplastics surgeons in the country. I've been on the wait list for about three months now, and I really have no idea what to expect to be honest. I went to the extra trouble to try and make sure my CT and MRI scans were there waiting for him, but I suspect that somehow they will have been lost come Wednesday, and we'll have nothing to talk about.</p>
<p>Truth is, I really don't know what the end result will be. Tonight I told some friends that it's really a lose-lose at this point, which is true from my perspective. Option one is to cut my face open again, pull out the plastic, and reconstruct my orbital floor with titanium. There's obvious risk to that surgery, as well as about six weeks of recovery to go through. Give than I have a 42mm x 40mm piece of plastic under my eye, as well as a pile of scar tissue under my eye, it's not really something I look forward to going through again.</p>
<p>Option two is to do nothing, which basically means I'll have double vision for the rest of my life. I tried to play billiards at my uncle's house in Chilliwack a few weeks ago, but I couldn't see the shots because there were two of everything I looked at. So at this point, every path I take is full of thorns I guess.</p>
<p>So I guess at this point we'll see what happens. I told a friend the other day that I would almost welcome another surgery, because it would mean a week off of work where I could sleep in and watch movies. The fact that I honestly feel that way is somewhat telling, and I don't really know what will happen. Maybe I can find a cute girl to curl up on a couch with me that week and watch movies.</p>
<p>But anyways, in about 36 hours I will have a good idea of where the last two years has led me.</p>
