                <p>Hey guys.. I've been thinking about completely revamping this website for quite a long time. Unfortunately, every time I start it, I always get sidetracked and end up throwing away a lot of the changes that I've made before.</p>
<p>However, I'm going to make some pretty major changes to it soon. Which means, I'm probably gonna take the site down for a while, probably starting this weekend. I have some pretty big ideas about what I want to do, and I'm not even sure I have the skill set to do them all. Some of the things I want to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>new theme for the look and feel that I want - it will probably be a dark background, even though most people seem to hate them 2) more ajax 3) photo-centric posts 4) better flickr/youtube integration 5) updated content 6) new hosting location (godaddy is sooooo slow)</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm hoping to get alot of it done this weekend, but the reality is it may take me longer than that. I could leave the website up, but I think I'll be far more motivated to actually finish all these changes off if I take it down. Also, changing hosting locations can be a bit of a pain due to DNS changes etc, so it's probably better to just take it down and get it done.</p>
<p>So, I'm probably gonna find some pub or coffee shop this weekend with wireless access and see what I can come up with.</p>
