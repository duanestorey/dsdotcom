                <p>My dad was down in Chilliwack today and he stopped at a home brew wine place. They had some special on so he asked me if I wanted to go halfers in with him on some homemade wine. Since I've never done it before, I thought I would give it a try and see if it's worth doing again.</p>
<p>The one we ended up picking was a Washington Shiraz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>White Sands &amp; Rattlesnake Vineyards, Yakima Washington A blockbuster with a rush of blackberry, plum, cherry and candied orange fragrances, which is followed by flavours of currant, fig, cedar and spice intertwined with a beautiful balance of toasted oak. The result is a rich, elegant finish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's one of their premium wines, so hopefully it tastes decent enough to drink. It needs at least 8 weeks before it's ready, and then they recommend aging it at home for a few more months, so we'll see.</p>
<p>Here are some photos my dad took of the whole process.</p>
