            <p>Ok guys. I'm tossing the gauntlet down. If you haven't been following recent events, a few days ago a major report on global warming came out that had some of the strongest language in it to date.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The group of climate experts released a 21-page report for policy makers worldwide that indicates with more than a 90 percent accuracy that rising atmospheric temperatures and increased greenhouse gases are linked, and the "most likely" cause of global warming, suggesting that humans have caused the problem.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The report found that it was "more likely than not" that manmade greenhouse gases have contributed to hotter days and nights, and more of them. Extreme weather patterns like more severe drought, greater than normal rainfall and more intense heat waves and "increased incidence" of extremely high sea levels are the result of man made greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you've seen "An Inconvenient Truth" or understand at all about global warming, then this shouldn't come as a surprise to you. But what may come as a suprise is the knowedge that even you can make a difference. So, I'm gonna put an option on the table here.</p>
<p>If you don't know what a CFL light bulb is, then read on. CFL light bulbs are very efficient light sources (at least when compared to the typical incandescent light bulb).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Replacing a single incandescent bulb with a CFL will keep a half-ton of CO2 out of the atmosphere over the life of the bulb. If everyone in the U.S. used energy-efficient lighting, we could retire 90 average size power plants. Saving electricity reduces CO2 emissions, sulfur oxide and high-level nuclear waste.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No only that, but they are far more efficient than incandescent light bulbs, meaning that you'll save money on your electric bill each month.</p>
<p>So here goes. I'm challenging everyone who reads my blog to go out in the next little while and replace some or all of your incandescent light bulbs in your house. A CFL will cost you a few bucks at most, and if you buy a few, you'll save money per bulb.</p>
<p>To make this a bit more "fun", I've created a flickr group for photos: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/49813481@N00/">check it out here</a>. As you replace your bulbs, take a few photos and post them to that group for inspiration. The more fun the photo, the better -- show everyone you replacing a bulb, you buying a bulb, or anything else related to this activity.</p>
<p>I'm gonna reach out to all of you who have blogs as well, or the means to get this message out -- send a few links this way so we can see just how much of an impact we can make. Also, if you have a healthy email list with friends that you think would like to be a part of this, then please send them an email with a link to this entry -- let's put that spam to good use!</p>
<p>If you don't have access to flickr (and don't want to sign up), just email the photos and I'll post them for you. I'll head out soon and do mine, but maybe you can beat me to the punch and put the first photos online in that group.</p>
<p>Once you've added some photos (or if you've changed a lightbulb or two), <a href="mailto:vancouverduane@hotmail.com">drop me an email</a> and let me know what you did and where you're from -- I'll try to compile a big list. Thanks guys.</p>
<p>--- Update: some of you have started to post photos to flickr, so I'll add a few of them here as you do! Good job guys.</p>
