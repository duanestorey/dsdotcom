                <p>For those of you who follow my Flickr and my blog, you'll remember a few weeks ago I encountered some of my photos being used commercially on the Internet without my permission. For a while there it looked like the only recourse was going to be through legal channels, but after meeting with everyone today at a coffee shop, I'm happy to say we've all agreed on an arrangement that should work out.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time trying to make sure rights of photographers are respected, and even went so far to do a podcast with the guys at Creative Commons last year. So I'm obviously glad that this issue was resolved peacefully and everyone walked away happy. I'm more than content to put this issue behind me and move on.</p>
