Like most Apple stores, the one in San Francisco is currently sold out of iPhones.

I sort of always assumed my 70-200mm f/2.8L lens would be pretty useless in poor lighting or in a wedding environment, but when I used it today with my speedlight, it was actually pretty awesome.

                I got my first roll back of Ilford XP2 back from development. My overall impression of it is pretty good - the grain is pretty light for ISO 400 (at least my memory of what ISO 400 was). It's not as contrasty as I normally like, and I bumped the contrast up slightly before posting them, but it's not that bad. The dynamic range is pretty decent, and the only shots that it struggled with were taken outside in the sun. All in all, I'm impressed enough that I'll give it another go.

It was a 36 shot roll of Ilford XP2, and it's probably the only black and white roll I've ever shot in my entire life, now that I think about it. The neat thing about this roll is that you can develop it in C41 chemistry (used for colour print film), which means you can basically get it developed anywhere in the city for next to nothing. I also have a few rolls of pure black and white to shoot, so I think it will be a useful c...

However, a lot of friends of mine who are into photography have started dabbling once again in the forbidden art, and it has caused me to take it seriously once again. I have no idea...
