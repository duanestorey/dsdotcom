                <p>Well, my dad is officially on vacation right now, and I'm only a few days behind him. It seems weird that in just four more days I'll be getting on a plane and disappearing for nearly two weeks. The next couple days are likely to be extremely busy. I have to get some new clothes and sandals for the beach, and also get my place cleaned up and my bags packed.</p>
<p>Hurricane Dean is hitting Jamaica pretty hard right now, and is supposed to head towards Mexico next, so it's likely it will be completely gone when I get down there -- hopefully nobody down there gets hurt while it's passing through. I get into Ottawa at around 7am on Friday morning, and will probably try to check into my hotel and sleep for a few hours. At night I'm sure I'll get together with Rob and Boris and have a few beers, even if it's while we're all setting up. Sunday I get on a greyhound bus at 2:30am and hit Montreal. The only problem is I have to get to the airport, and the bus is talking me to the greyhound station. Right now I'm planning on hailing a cab and getting to the airport, so hopefully it all falls together.</p>
<p>So, in less that seven days, I'll be checking in from 35C weather in the Dominican, hopefully around a pool bar. I'll post as many photos as possible.</p>
