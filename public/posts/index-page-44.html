That's Rebecca and Teddy at my place in Chilliwack. Teddy was given to me by my grandma when I was less than a year old. I've had him ever since, and have been keeping him around for when my first kid is born. As a kid, Teddy and I went through lots of hard times, and it's pretty encouraging to know he's still around to see me through the bad times, even as an adult.
When my grandma went into surgery years ago, I thought I'd return the favour, and left Teddy under her arm in the recovery room a...

                I was doing a little research on carbon offsets this morning, and just for yucks, wanted to price out what it would cost to be a supplier of carbon offsets in Canada. There are various ways to offset carbon, but a fairly standard one is to plant trees in exchange for money. How many trees can you plant on an acre of land? Well, turns out this guy has it all figured out, at least for poplar trees. If you space them 10' x 10', you can get around 436 trees on an acre.
The average tree consumes abou...

                This is actually a pretty big deal. Most people don't realize it, but North America is one of the few places in the world that uses high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) to sweeten drinks and other items. Most other places in the world use pure glucose, which is the main sugar our bodies are built to run on. Fructose is far sweeter than glucose so you can use less of it to sweeten a product. High fructose corn syrup is typically composed of around 55% fructose and another 45% glucose. If you order a c...

Last time I looked at Vonage, I believe they were charging around $30/month, plus an activation fee and equipment fee of around $70 at the start. So while you do get a lot of bells and whistles included in that price (caller ID etc), it's still rather expensive in my mind.
