                Just read that an Air Canada flight from Victoria to Toronto was forced to make an emergency landing in Calgary due to turbulence. Apparently the plane hit a patch of turbulence that sent a pile of people into the ceiling. I would have probably shit my pants had that happened on my flight. My last flight to Kelowna was pretty bad, and my glasses came off at one point, but thankfully my head didn't encountered the ceiling.

She said they all said "photo by Duane Storey", and that she was sure they were mine.

They are a lot of fun, and always a great chance for people to improve their skills or just get out and stretch their wings a bit.

Needless to say, when I walked off the plane way up north, I was a bit bummed, and a bit out of sorts.

While Europe is ahead of North America in this regard, we have slowly been migrating most of our North American television services to digital, and in most cases, HD. I believe the US has a target date of around 2013 to be completely digital.
