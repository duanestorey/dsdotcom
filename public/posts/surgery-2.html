                <p>I met with my plastic surgeon this morning, and as I thought, we're going to go ahead and do another surgery. The apparent source of my problem seems to be that the ledge that was supporting the implant ended up not being very stable, and the implant has collapsed slightly along with my eye. Also, there is slight herniation of some of orbital contents into my sinus near the back, which is most likely the source of my double vision.</p>
<p>The good news is that it should be nearly 100% fixable. They are going to put in another larger implant, and probably secure it using microscrews (sounds so exciting doesn't it) so that it doesn't drift.</p>
<p>Since one of the only things I've been looking forward to for a while is my 30th birthday, I've decided to postpone the surgery until after April 7th. I don't really want to risk something not going quite right and having to miss out on my own big event. I have a meeting on April 13th to discuss the surgery a little more, and will probably have the actual surgery the following week, most likely on the Monday or the Thursday.</p>
<p>Mixed emotions right now I guess. I definitely would like to not have double vision anymore, and it would be nice to not have a constant reminder of November 4th every time I look in the mirror. I'm just not really looking forward to surgery and the associated recovery time, even though for the most part, it was relatively painless.</p>
