            <p>How's that for a title? It'll pretty much sum my day up when it's all over.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, I've been super tired lately. Despite getting a fairly normal amount of sleep during the week, I've hit the last few weekends completely exhausted. Yesterday, for example, I spent a few hours sleeping on the couch by the fire. Upon waking up in the early evening, I watched a few movies, and then went straight to bed, sleeping in until around 10am (after the time change). It definitely feels great, but I really don't know why I'm so tired lately.</p>
<p>Friday afternoon I went out to see <a href="http://www.matthewgood.org">Matt</a> and the boys rehearse. I can't say I've ever seen rehearsals for a big tour before, so it was cool to check it out. I've seen Matt do a few sound checks before, but to sit for three or four hours and watch them tweak the music, lights and sound was pretty cool. I took a few photos, and also filmed around 35 minutes of video -- once Dale edits all the video together, they'll end up on <a href="http://facebook.com/matthewgood.org">Matt's Facebook fan page</a>.</p>

<p>I was originally going to go hang out with my niece and nephew last night, but I woke up yesterday feeling a bit under the weather. When I was down in San Francisco for WordCamp, my eyelid started getting really sore and swollen near the end of the day. I'm not sure if it was an ingrown eyelash or an infection, but it definitely hurt. I woke up yesterday with pretty much the same thing, so I was putting some drops in it off and on between naps. Today I feel better in general, but my eye lid is still a bit swollen.</p>
<p>Now that it's November 1st, I'm gearing up for quite a few events this month. In two weeks time is <a href="http://daveandlauren.us/">Dave and Lauren's</a> wedding down in Seattle, so I'll be heading down for that on the Friday and spending the weekend in Seattle, something I'm looking forward to. Every time in the past I've been in Seattle it's been pretty miserable weather, so I'm hoping for nice sunshiny autumn weather. Four days after I get back from that I'm packing up and heading to Punta Cana for two weeks. To be honest, I don't think I've ever gone on a remote two week vacation before. Packing for one week isn't too hard, but packing for two weeks (and only bringing one suitcase) is going to be a challenge. I think I'm pretty much guaranteed I'll have to do laundry down there, even if that's washing a few shirts in the bath tub and leaving them to dry during the day. The first week we're all basically just relaxing by the pool, but the second week Dale and I are doing a bit of a working vacation, since we have a lot of brainstorming and scheming to do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, my plane to the Dominican leaves at like 1am in the morning from Vancouver International. Leaving my car at the airport for two weeks is a waste of money, so I may just head in for the day, check my luggage, and then take the Canada line downtown and spend the afternoon walking around and shopping. The plane also has to stop in Calgary on the way there (which wasn't planned, but is now part of the schedule). I think I land in Punta Cana sometime around 2pm on the 19th, which means I should be by the pool with a beer in my hand sometime around 3pm that day. Dale and Sara get in the day after, so I'll have a day to scope everything out and introduce myself to the locals.</p>
<p>So, November is pretty much accounted for. As soon as I return from Punta Cana I'll be setting up my tree and settling into the Christmas spirit. I'm definitely looking forward to the next four weeks, that's for sure.</p>
