                Well here I am, in the Dominican Republic, taking a quick break from drinking to write a small blog entry here. This is the first time in quite a while where I've just relaxed and been content with reading. Last night I tried to use the wireless internet here, but it wasn't working. And as soon as I learned it wasn't, I almost felt a bit anxious. And that's when I realized just how important it is that I just put the computer away this trip, and enjoy my time by the pool. So, I doubt I'll do mor...

The wedding was quite lovely, and it was absolutely great to hang out with old friends again. It was a bit shocking to me to remember just how good some of these friends were. I guess my time back in Vancouver has sort of dulled my memo...

I woke up close to 3pm, which meant I only had an hour or so before I had to head down to Manotick for the wedding rehearsal. I did a quick tour of downtown Ottawa with the time I had, took a few photos, and then got picked up by Alison.

We landed about 20 minutes ago, and all I want to do is curl up in a ball and have a nice sleep, but unfortunately I have to transfer plans in a bit and head to Ottawa. Normally I'd find a chair and try to sleep, but given that my body is about 8 hours behind on sleep now, I don't think it's a good idea to close my eyes, since I probably will sleep right through the boarding call on my plane.

As soon as I put my car into the parkade, I reached into my pocket to pull out my wallet, only to realize it wasn't there. Since I'm less that 48 hours away from getting on a plane, the thought of not having access to any of my bank cards or visa was a bit scary at that moment.

So on Saturday morning, at the crack of dawn, we all piled into my car and set out on the quest for fish (which would later become the quest for nachos). Surprisingly, everyone's camping gear fit into the back of my hatcbback, but I think next year I...
