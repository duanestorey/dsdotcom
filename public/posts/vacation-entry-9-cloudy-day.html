            <p>Thankfully the clouds are overhead today, because yesterday was absolutely insanely hot. So hot in fact, that most people didn't even hang out by the pool bar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/1261399466/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1240/1261399466_d274a82d8a.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>I'm pretty much all pooled out I think, so I'm going to find something else to do today. I'll probably walk down to the Plaza and book an excursion or two. They have an all-day catamaran trip to a remote island (with an open bar I might add) that sounds fairly appealing, as well as a safari trip to a waterfall you can swim in. Talking to people around here, it sounds like nearly everyone has had a lackluster summer back home, so don't feel bad all you Vancouver people. As of tomorrow I'll be more than half-way done this trip, and it's gone rather quickly. Around Friday I'll start to figure out just how in the hell I'm getting home, since there are still a few unknowns (like how I get from Montreal to Ottawa for the flight home). It'll all work out though, so I'm not worried about it.</p>
<p>I am, without a doubt, the most tanned I've been in a long while. And by tanned, I really mean burnt. My chest is a bright red, and so are my knees and arms. Despite lathering tons of sunscreen on everything, I've pretty much been getting worse. So today, I'm going to stay away from the pool, and am going to leave my shirt on for the day. Hopefully this will move me from "burn" to "solid tan".</p>
<p>I keep sleeping in rather late, which presents somewhat of a problem in the eating department -- I usually miss breakfast (which was pretty tasty the one and only day I ate it), and have to sit around waiting for lunch to occur at 1pm. I tried hard to make breakfast today, but it just wasn't happening. So, here I am, hungry again. Thankfully I can just drink to pass the time, which is where I think I'm heading now.</p>
