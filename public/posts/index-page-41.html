As I mentioned in a previous post, I decided the other day that I wanted to try growing a few things on my patio. I used to help my grandma with her garden when I was a kid, and I have fond memories out in the back of her house playing in the dirt. My patio in Chilliwack is about twice the size as my patio was in Vancouver, so I'm definitely sure I have the room now to grow a few vegetables.

Other than maybe a camping trip this weekend, and WordCamp San Francisco at the end of the month, the next six weeks or so are pretty booked up solid with some client projects. After that I'm going to take a bit of a break for the summer and do some camping or maybe even head over to Europe to visit some friends.

Unlike last year, I actually scheduled a bit of breathing room this trip, so I'll have time to check out the event and also catch a few sights in the Bay Area....

                I was thinking about setting up a little garden on my patio. Obviously, I don't really have a lot of room out there, so growing things like potatoes are out of the question (not that I'd grow potatoes or anything). I could grow some herbs maybe I guess, but I'm not really sure when they grow best. I'm also thinking about putting a little compost bin outside so I can make some healthy soil for all my plants here.
Any thoughts?...

                A while ago I started messing around with trying to get a single WordPress installation to host multiple blogs. If you read that and think WordPress MU, you're not far off. What I don't like about WordPress MU though is that the system administrator chooses the themes and the plugins that are available to the end user -- ideally, I would want each user to control that themselves, such that it basically has the same functionality as a normal WordPress installation.
There are a lot of other reason...

I thought maybe I had forgot to flush the toilet or something stupid like that, but everything was totally clean. I turned the fan on for a while, thinking it would go away, but it didn't really seem to. This morning the smell was still there, and I debated calling my building manager to see if they could take a look (or a smell).

                When I moved back to Chilliwack, one of the first things that changed was my diet.

Obviously seeing a large commercial airliner flying low over New York City set a lot of people into a panic. For whatever reason, that flight was deemed somewhat classified so nobody could tell the people living in New York City about it.
