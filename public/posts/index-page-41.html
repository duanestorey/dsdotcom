                Unfortunately, the night before I left for New York City turned out to be a gong show. Mark, Donovan, Chris and myself went out to the bar for a few drinks, but we didn't stop until around 2am. I figured, no problem right -- I still have 4 hours to sleep and pack before leaving for the airport. Needless to say, Friday morning was really rough, and I was completely exhausted and hungover.
What made it worse is that our plane was broken. After 30 minutes of waiting past of scheduled boarding time,...

Well, I got back from Chilliwack a few hours ago, and have just been lounging on the couch since then. I had a great time in the wack -- I spent Saturday night at my sister's house, playing with my neice and nephew, and watching a couple of movies. In the morning, we all headed over to my dad's house to watch him open a few presents. Afterwards, dad, Cathy and I went over to Frank's house for a nice BBQ.
I'm pretty happy that I finally got to wash and vacuum my car this weekend.. There's nothin...

                I was just reading that Sony has finally come out with a digital SLR of their own. At first I kind of scoffed at it, thinking that nobody really uses Sony these days (seems like everywhere I go someone has a Canon or Nikon SLR). However, reading the specs, it seems pretty impressive. I like the idea of putting the image stabilization in the camera body instead of on the lens. Canon charges quite a bit for the IS versions of several of its lenses, so it's nice to know that Sony is a little smarte...
