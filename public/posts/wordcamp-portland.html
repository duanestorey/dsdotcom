                <p>I just finished booking my flight to WordCamp Portland, so I figured now was a good time to write a post about it. I was a co-organizer for two WordCamp Vancouver events, as well as one up in Whistler, but strangely enough I haven't actually spoken at a WordCamp for almost about two years now. So having me up front should make for some interesting entertainment.</p>
<p>I'll be speaking on mobile blogging, with an emphasis on our WPtouch plugin. I'll probably also talk a bit about mobile blogging in general, similarly to what I talked about at the Network Hub a few years ago. If I have time, I'll probably also touch on the WordPress iPhone application a bit, and whatever else in the mobile sphere I can find. <a href="http://ma.tt">Matt Mullenweg</a> will also be holding a town-hall type of event where the audience can ask a bunch of WordPress questions, so that should be fun.</p>
<p>I'll be flying out of Bellingham on the 18th of September, and returning late at night on the 20th. I'm not sure where I'll be staying yet, but a few people pinged me on Twitter with some possible options, so we'll see where those lead. I believe I'm currently slotted to speak on Sunday sometime, so Saturday will probably be the day I start putting my slides together. I imagine there will be some type of social on Saturday as well, so that should be fun.</p>
