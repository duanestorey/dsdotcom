                <p>It seems like it's been raining out here forever. Maybe it's because I spend so much time at home lately, and I can constantly hear the little pitter-patter of raindrops on the rooftop vents. Regardless, it's making me more and more excited to be on the beach in about seven days now.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'm taking it pretty easy since it's a stat holiday. That said, we're going to push out some quick updates for WordTwit and WPtouch which should hopefully allow the two to start working together. If you use WordTwit, WPtouch will soon be able to show all your recent Tweets. It should be a pretty cool addition, and you can look forward to additional coupling between all our plugins in the near future.</p>

<p>Right after we release the PHP upon the world, I have to head out and find a dry-cleaner. I have a wedding on Saturday to attend, and I really need to get some clothes dry-cleaned and pressed before then. Friday morning I'll be heading down to Seattle, maybe doing a little casual shopping on the way. I'll be staying at the Alexis Hotel in Seattle. I really have no idea where it is at this point, but it looks pretty nice.</p>
<p>I also ran into this pretty cool email-to-blog service called <a href="http://posterous.com">Posterous</a>. I set myself up a <a href="http://duanestorey.posterous.com/">really simple blog</a> where I might simply post photos from my iPhone. But I love the idea, and how they've made it super simple to simply email media and text to a centralized blogging location. I also think the collaborative option is pretty cool.</p>
<p>Anyways, enjoy the rain, I'm off to bed.</p>
