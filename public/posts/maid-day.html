                <p>Yes, it's that time of month again, maid day. When I got sick with pneumonia in the fall my mom came and spent a few days with me and ended up cleaning my entire apartment. Being a busy, single guy, it was in a pretty sad state. My mom, being a constant worrier, implored me, for her sake, to get someone to help clean my apartment so it would be clean and I wouldn't have to worry about getting sick at home.</p>
<p>Since I'm sort of cheap (at least for things that don't involve technology), but wanted to put my mom's mind at ease, I made myself a compromise -- I'd get a maid but cancel my cable TV to pay for it. So, that's what I did, and I've had two girls come every two weeks and clean my apartment for me ever since.</p>
<p>At first it felt weird paying someone to clean my apartment, but I've gotten used to it. Considering I used to spend a large amount of time each week attempting to clean my apartment (but since I suck at cleaning it never really got very clean), it's really nice having some extra time now to do other things.</p>
<p>It costs me about $50 every two weeks, which is pretty expensive based on a few other people I know who have the same setup. But the girls are cute, fun to talk to, they do a good job and are bonded, so I'm ok with it for now.</p>
<p>So after three or four months now, I can say I'm a happy camper and I'm glad with the decision I made. If you're on the fence about doing something similar, I'd say go for it -- you probably won't regret it.</p>
<p>In case anyone is wondering, the people who clean my place are part of <a href="http://www.lifemaidsimple.ca/">Life Maid Simple</a>, which is a relatively new business that prides itself in only using eco-friendly products.</p>
<p>Oh, and a little tidbit of information to start a war -- I asked them who their dirtiest clients were one time. The answer? Women, mostly professionals like doctors and lawyers. One specific girl's apartment required the removal of 8 hefty green garbage bags in a one bedroom apartment on their first visit. So I don't feel that bad now.</p>
<p>I'm laying low tonight and probably doing a bit of work on the computer (I really need to unplug soon). Tomorrow morning (early!) I'm going on a field trip with John and Rebecca to the airport to see <a href="http://miss604.com">Rebecca</a> off to Toronto for her showing on <a href="http://www.miss604.com/2008/01/test-the-nation-more-info-and-bc-bloggers.html">Test The Nation</a>. Will post some photos when I get back.</p>
