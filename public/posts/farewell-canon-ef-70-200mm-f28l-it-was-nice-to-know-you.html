                <p>I got a call from Canon today about my lens with water vapour in it. They verdict: completely unfixable.</p>
<p>To be honest, I'm a bit pissed off. When I shipped it out to them, I followed it up with a call telling them it was rather urgent, and they needed to get to it first since it concerned water damage. The lady on the phone told me they were 5 days behind, and there was nothing she could do. Anyways, when they finally get to it, it was corroded inside and not worth fixing.</p>
<p>The replacement cost of the new lens is around $1600, so I'm going to be submitting my first ever insurance claim. The shitty part is that I have special insurance on all my camera equipment, except of course that lens since it's rather recent. Had anything else bit the dust, I would have been able to get a new one without any deductible at all.</p>
<p>My main concern right now is that I have a wedding to shoot in 3 weeks, and that lens is part of it. I can always rent one, but I'm hoping insurance doesn't take forever to get the cash to me so I can go grab a new one. We'll see</p>
