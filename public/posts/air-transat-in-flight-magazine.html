            <p>So Leila just came up to me at work today and said congrats. I said "for what?" And she said she was recently on an Air Transat flight and came across a pile of photos in the middle of the in-flight magazine from my last trip to the Dominican Republic. She said they all said "photo by Duane Storey", and that she was sure they were mine.</p>
<p>Funny thing is I had no idea they had been published. I know Air Transat has a section where users can submit their photos for consideration, which I did after coming back from the Dominican Republic, but nobody ever contacted me and said they were going to use them.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/1270344623/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1326/1270344623_78202175be.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></a> One of the photos they probably used</p>
<p>I'm totally happy that people are looking at my photos on every Air Transat plane now, but it would have been nice to know I had been published though, and to maybe get a hard copy of the magazine in the mail.</p>
<p>Update - I've talked to Air Transat, and it sounds like they are going to send me a few hard copies. Thanks!</p>
