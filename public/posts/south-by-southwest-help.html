                <p>So, here's the deal. I <strong>really</strong> want to attend some of South by Southwest this year. The only problem is that all the hotels in Austin, Texas are pretty much sold out. I worked the phones for a bit tonight trying to find a place to crash, but haven't had any luck. So, a friend of mine told me to put something on my blog to see if any fish would bite.</p>
<p>So, is there anyone that has a floor or a couch they could possibly donate for a few days during South by Southwest this year in Austin, Texas. I'd happily trade some photography skills or web skills in return. Drop me a line if you can hook it up.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
