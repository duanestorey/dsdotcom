                <p>As of this moment, I am officially "on call" for my next surgery at St. Paul's hospital. I was hoping that I would have gotten the call on Sunday night for a Monday morning surgery (I just want it over with), but unfortunately I still haven't had the call yet. I won't be able to eat for twelve hours prior, so I'm pretty much guaranteed to get at least that much notice. It would be nice if they could give more notice than that, but apparently the hospitals are rather busy, and it's difficult to book them in advance.</p>

<p>My dad has a change of clothes in his truck waiting for the moment I know. I'm not really supposed to be alone for the first day or so just in case something goes wrong, so my dad is going to come spend a day here looking out for me while I most likely sleep the days away.</p>
<p>I'm actually more nervous this time for the surgery, probably because I know full well what to expect, and what the recovery involves. For a recap of the whole experience, you can <a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/2006/11/08/saturday-night/">check out the entry from the initial injury</a> or the entry <a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/2006/11/24/surgery/">immediately after coming out of my last surgery</a>. I imagine this one will be rather similar, except of course they will first be removing the implant under my eye before starting any other work.</p>
<p>I will be at home for at least a week after my surgery, healing, watching movies, and probably doing a little work on my blog. If anyone has any movie or book suggestions, just drop me a line.</p>
