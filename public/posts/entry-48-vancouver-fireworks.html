                <p>I live right near English Bay, and right now most of Vancouver is gathering outside my front door to see the second night of the fireworks. As a kid, seeing the fireworks was something I used to really enjoy. But as an adult, I don't really enjoy large crowds anymore, or fighting to get a spot to sit. That being said, I appreciate that the event brings a lot of people together from various parts of Vancouver, and the Fraser Valley.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="http://tonypierce.com">our good pal Tony</a> was visiting Vancouver, and we all got to hang out, drink a few beers, and watch the fireworks together. And while we didn't make it to the fireworks this year, we all sat around and lamented the fact that Tony wasn't up here again this time of year.</p>
<p>This is my second last entry, and I'll leave everyone with a photo of the fireworks from last year.</p>
