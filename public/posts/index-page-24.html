                Wordpress 2.5.1 came out today. Wordpress 2.5 was actually a bit buggy (IMO), so I'm happy to incorporate this new release. I was for some reason still running a 2.6 beta version, and now I'm officially back on the stable line. If you're a Wordpress user, you might want to download it and install it -- apparently it has a few rather important security releases....

For whatever reasons, it seems like feed burner is not filtering the content based on my user account at Flickr, but instead is including public photos tagged "feedburner", something it never used to do.
I checked my settings, and it's definitely setup to only include photos from my stream, so the problem seems to be on their end. I tried finding a contact email on their site, but all ...

But without a doubt, it's a serious infection, and is responsible for many deaths. The superbug the media focuses on is MRSA, but in terms of fatalities, c. d...

                Yes, sports fans, it's been twelve days since I decided to move my hosting back onto my living room floor. So far, it's been 12 days of pure bliss, of heavenly visions filled with bunny rabbits and endless fields of sunshine and happiness, where kids run forever.
But seriously, things have been going rather great. I haven't had a single hiccup, and get complete SQL backups emailed to me twice a day, just in case something were to ever go wrong. All my data is backed up with RAID 5 storage (and w...

                I just saw a fairly recent (February 2008) film showing a slide-show that Al Gore recently gave on climate change. Here's a version of the video from Ted.com. It's inline with the material presented in his film, An Inconvenient Truth, but includes recent data and observations.
I watched that video once earlier today, and once again the moment this posting went live. To be honest, while I think he makes amazing points, I have a hard time watching it, mostly because the frustration is so evident i...

Of course, I received countless emails that said I had access to this event, which of course I tried to explain to her. Her argument was that those emails didn't mean anything, and that they were limited by space. Eventually she let me in, but it was a rather big hassle.
