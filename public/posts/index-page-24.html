                I realized last night that I'm sort of envious of the people who only post their best photos to their Flickr stream for the purpose of showcasing work or soliciting opinions on techniques. Given that my current Flickr account is pretty jam packed of personal photos, I thought I would start a second account for mainly my high-quality photos or photos that I've taken time to process and enhance.

Seeing Richard's back story helped put some of the pieces together. Like most people on the island, Richard's past isn't all rosy -- he lost his wife and accidentally killed a person. He's been on the island now over 150 years, and obviously hasn't aged at all. We're led to believe that he is an immortal now due to Jacob's t...

I used to drink probably close to 2L of diet pepsi a day in Vancouver, mostly because the office I worked at had a fountain pop machine that everyone could use for free. Whether or not diet soda is a health concern is still up for debate, but undoubtedly it has aspartame (even though it has a good safety record, it's still a chemical) as well as caffeine (which has been linked to ...

You'll rarely see me eating a cookie or a chocolate bar (in fact, I don't really have a sweet tooth at all), but nachos are my weakness.

A recent example involves Virgin America and a plane that was on the tarmac (loaded with passengers) for nearly 4 and a half hours.

Many people probably aren't aware of this, but Roger had a run in with cancer a few years ago, and ultimately lost not only his lower jaw in the process, but also his ability to speak.
