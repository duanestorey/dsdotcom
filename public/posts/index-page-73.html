                Being a single guy, every once and a while I find myself reading the personal ads in Vancouver. I used to do it thinking that there was the possibility of meeting someone online, at least someone with similar interests and what not to hang out and be friends, but it's pretty clear most of the people on those sites these days just aren't really the caliber of people I'm looking for. I actually met one of my girlfriends on lavalife years ago, and we hit it off and are still friends to this day, so...

That being said, I demolished the competition and walked away with the "you totally fucking rule" badge.

I am totally a LOTR geek, and even wore a little ring around my neck for a few months after reading the series for the first time.

                Easily one of my top ten films ever (well maybe top 20) is the rare gem that is Cameron Crowe's "Almost Famous." If you haven't seen it, you should immediately head out to the movie store and rent it. It's full of touching moments, laughter, self discovery and even a dash of romance.
Not only is the writing and story telling superb, but the photography and cinematography are both outstanding. I'll post a few scenes here I really like (obvious spoilers).

                Heat is a totally awesome movie starring both Al Pacino and Robert Deniro. There are many classic scenes in it, but one that stands out is the coffee shop banter between Pacino and Deniro where we learn a pile about both characters. This type of scene has been used in countless movies since then, but they all basically pay homage to this part.
Why I think it's so fascinating is that both characters open up to each other and somehow relate, even though they are basically enemies by trade. And let...

First movie we talked about was one Brennen and I totally loved years ago: Tombstone. Here's is the scene where Johnny Ringo and Doc Holliday have their fin...

                The original Star Wars Trilogy really needs no introduction, so I won't really say much about it except that it totally kicked ass, as would any trilogy involving a bad guy voiced by James Earl Jones.
This scene is a classic battle scene involving Luke and Darth Vadar, where of course Luke loses his hand at the end and ultimately learns who his real father is.

However, I've always really liked this one scene. I could care less if you hate Tom Cruise or think his religion is bogus (even though it is) -- this scene is pretty high up there in terms of cinematic perfection in my mind.
As a whole, Vanilla Sky wasn't that great, but this last scene, with the music, the wisp...
