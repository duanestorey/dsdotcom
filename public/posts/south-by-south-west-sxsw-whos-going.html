                <p>For two years in a row now, I've missed out on going to SxSW. For those of you who don't know what it is, it's pretty much the largest technology / music conference in North America, and it happens once a year down in Austin, Texas. Last year, while watching everyone talk about it online, I decided that I would go this year and check it out.</p>
<p>That being said, I still haven't done anything about it, nor am I entirely sure I could afford to go to it (although I *do* have a pre-paid flight ticket in the US, so my flight is pretty much covered). Pretty much all my friends from Vancouver end up going, and it would suck to miss it another year. So maybe I'll go work a corner downtown somewhere and see if I can pull together some extra scraps to attend.</p>
<p>That being said, if you're heading down there, drop a comment and let me know. Peer pressure is an effective motivator with me, and it might just get my butt in gear enough to try and pull together the funds and make it down there this year. Also, if you're a media company with a pile of cash burning a hole in your pocket, and want to send me there, drop me a line! I'd be happy to take photos for a week and do a bunch of write-ups.</p>
