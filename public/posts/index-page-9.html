                Today is also my step-sister Alison's birthday. Strangely enough, I went through my Flickr photos and I don't really have any good shots of her, so I had to grab one from her Facebook profile instead. Tonight we're having a little BBQ over at my dad's house for her, which should be fun (although I probably won't be staying too long, as I'm pretty swamped with work).

Happy Birthday Alison!...

                I was wondering today just how long my little garden has been growing for. Looking at my Flickr set, it looks like I had moved a few of the tomato seedlings outside on May 22nd. Here's a shot at the time:

I took a few photos today, and wanted to do a little comparison. It's been roughly five weeks since I started, and here's what things look like today:

As you can see, things are progressing nicely. I had a little mishap about a week ago where I accidentally broke the main stem on one of my ro...

Strangely enough, while I like summer and am looking forward to a few heat waves, my mind always wonders to the next season. For example, the other day there was a bit of rain, and it reminded me of sitting in front of the fire and watching movies a few months ago.

                So, I gotta ask, and I'm probably going to get raked over the coals for doing so. I'm curious as to why there are so many technology events that focus exclusively on women? Some of them actually look pretty good, and I'm actually a bit disappointed that I can't attend. In fact, some of the people I really look up to in the community are female, which makes it all the more disappointing that I'm excluded by nature from some conferences.
And that's really my question I guess -- why can't I attend ...

                Some days I wake up and still find it a bit weird that I'm back in my home town. I'm totally enjoying myself here, more so with each passing month, but certain aspects of being here are still strange to me. High school literally feels like yesterday to me, probably because I spent so much of my 20s in school, but when I think back to high school here, I have a hard time putting all the pieces together.
For example, I went by my old house I lived in when I was 17. Strangely enough, I couldn't rem...

As many people know, there are protests going on in Iran, and the Iranian government is actively trying to stop the flow of information both in and out of the country. Twitter has been instrumental in helping getting the word out about what is going on there, so much so that they recently postponed a critical maintenance period simply so Iranian users could continue to use the service. A few hours ago I saw some requests on Twitter from Iranians asking for international proxies such that they c...

                So, here I am, in San Francisco. I've actually been here a pile of times before, and I always find something new and unique about it every time I'm here.
We actually went out for some wicked Mexican food tonight. The guacamole was $15 USD, but it was totally worth it. I've had some great guac in my time (thanks Keira), but this was probably right up there as some of the best I've ever tasted, and it was a really great meal.

                I was talking to my mom on the phone the other night, and she reminded me that it had been nearly a week since I'd written a post on here. Truthfully I almost forgot that I had a blog -- I just haven't had the urge to write much lately. Maybe it's because my days all sort of blur into each other these days, something hopefully the summer will remedy.

I hung out with an old friend on Sunday, and we basically just bounced around Chilliwack drinking the odd beer in the sun - it was good times. I e...

                A few months ago I picked up a pretty cool cook-book called the Low-Carb Gourmet. It was written by a Vancouver chef, and most of the recipes in it came about from some professional recipes used in some local Vancouver restaurants.

I haven't had a pile of time to create many recipes from it yet, but one of the ones I have used a few times is a really great recipe for Flaxseed muffins. I can't really say that I'd eaten a lot of flaxseed in my life prior to making these, so first thing I did was ...

I used to help my grandma with her garden when I was a kid, and I have fond memories out in the back of her house playing in the dirt. My patio in Chilliwack is about twice the size as my patio was in Vancouver, so I'm definitely sure I have the room now to grow a few vegetables.

Other than maybe a camping trip this weekend, and WordCamp San Francisco at the end of the month, the next six weeks or so are pretty booked up solid with some client projects. After that I'm going to take a bit of a break for the summer and do some camping or maybe even head over to Europe to visit some friends.
So on that note, I'm going to take a break from traditional blog posts and do a week or so worth of photo entries. Comment if you li...

Unlike last year, I actually scheduled a bit of breathing room this trip, so I'll have time to check out the event and also catch a few sights in the Bay Area....

                I was thinking about setting up a little garden on my patio. Obviously, I don't really have a lot of room out there, so growing things like potatoes are out of the question (not that I'd grow potatoes or anything). I could grow some herbs maybe I guess, but I'm not really sure when they grow best. I'm also thinking about putting a little compost bin outside so I can make some healthy soil for all my plants here.
Any thoughts?...

                A while ago I started messing around with trying to get a single WordPress installation to host multiple blogs. If you read that and think WordPress MU, you're not far off. What I don't like about WordPress MU though is that the system administrator chooses the themes and the plugins that are available to the end user -- ideally, I would want each user to control that themselves, such that it basically has the same functionality as a normal WordPress installation.
There are a lot of other reason...

Nearly 80 percent of American families have at least one credit card, 44 percent of families carry a balance on their credit cards, and Americans pay about $15 billion a year in penalty fees, according to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's office.

The current population in the US is around 305 million (2008 census). I don't know how many families are in the US, but ...

                I was wondering why the term "happy star wars day" was trending on Twitter. Apparently today (May 4th) is, believe it or not, Star Wars Day. It's called that because of the play on words with "May the force be with you". Since today is May 4th, people say "May the 4th be with you".
So, happy Star Wars Day everyone!

                So before going to bed last night I walked into my second bathroom as was greeted with a not-so-nice smell. I thought maybe I had forgot to flush the toilet or something stupid like that, but everything was totally clean. I turned the fan on for a while, thinking it would go away, but it didn't really seem to. This morning the smell was still there, and I debated calling my building manager to see if they could take a look (or a smell).
Before doing that though, I Googled around a bit to see if ...

                When I moved back to Chilliwack, one of the first things that changed was my diet. I typically worked long hours in Vancouver, and that naturally led to me eating a lot of restaurant food. I'd normally want to sleep in as long as possible in the mornings, so I usually skipped breakfast in exchange for a few more minutes of zzzz's. Lunch was normally something I'd eat down in the Food Court in the Bentall Center. There weren't a lot of food options, but I'd typically switch between Subway or sush...

                The other day I had the crazy idea of starting a community driven site here in Chilliwack. I pinged a few people online about a possible name, and eventually settled on InTheWack.com. In the back of my mind, parts of the site would be similar to Urban Vancouver, while others would resemble a more traditional newspaper. I whipped something together real quick on Friday night after I got back home from Vancouver, and have been sort of passively playing with it.

                I accidentally stumbled across the official Whitehouse Flickr account tonight, and was pretty enthralled by some of the photos in the account. First thing that's cool is that the Whitehouse even has a Flickr account. Second thing to take note of is that the photos are licensed with a creative commons attribution license, so basically you're free to use them in both commercial and non-commercial settings as long as you do proper attribution.

Saying you're an expert at Twitter is like saying you're an expert at talking, or being able to hold a conversation. Sure, you have to understand what an @ sign does, and how to direct message someone, but other than that Twitter is just another tool in a wide arsenal of technology that allows people to establish and build relationships.

                This is pretty stupid. The US government sanctioned the flight of a low-flying 747 over New York city the other day. Obviously seeing a large commercial airliner flying low over New York City set a lot of people into a panic. For whatever reason, that flight was deemed somewhat classified so nobody could tell the people living in New York City about it.

                For whatever reason, I didn't end up falling asleep until around 4am last night. Obviously waking up this morning after about four hours of sleep was pretty crappy. I'm out of cream at home so I meandered my way down to one of my two favorite coffee shops and set up shop.
Unfortunately, I forgot my wallet and my cell phone at home (at least I'm hoping my wallet is at home). Thankfully I had a few bucks worth of change in my pocket so I could order a coffee. The problem with lack of sleep is that...

I also snagged a pretty cute shot of a little Jelly Bean girl waiting to start rolling her ball.

                Just a quick question to the photography crowd out there. Does anyone have any experience selling photos on microstock websites? A couple of people have asked me if I've ever put any photographs on microstock sites. I haven't, mainly because I feel pretty strange selling photos for 50 cents each. Truthfully though, most of my photos sit there collecting dust anyways and don't make any money, so I was just curious if there's enough volume on those sites to turn over any non-trivial cash-flow.

I've been using Twitter for a long time now, and the one universal constant in that time period has been the flakiness of the Twitter service. Even today, at least a year after some of these problems started cropping up, you still get the occasional "Fail Whale" when the servers can't keep up. Some of the other random problems I've witnessed lately are:

the inability to upload a new avatar
missing background images on profiles

                As most people already know, I am a big fan of camping. I'm not really sure why to be honest, but there's something about being in the wilderness with nothing but a bit of nylon between you and the outdoors that I've always found appealing. Maybe it started years ago when my dad and I used to crash out in his camper when I was a kid. Maybe it was all those trips I did with Brennen and Jeff in the old days. Needless to say, it's one of the things about summer I always look forward to.

So, being the amazingly awesome friend that I am, I packed up my camera and hopped into John's company's mini-cooper.

For whatever reason, Twitter seems to have disabled the unfollow/follow button his account, so people can't unfollow him. Thankfully, the Twitter API has a solution to this problem. If you want to unfollow Ashton, try the following:

Today I got an email from an old friend I hadn’t heard from in a while. Jill wrote me an email and let me know than her boyfriend thought he would be the poster boy for immaturity and break up with her via email. Obviously, I don’t think that’s very cool. You would think if you care about someone you would at least have the decency to do it in person.
That period of time after I got tossed through that window was obviously pretty hard on me. I went through two surgeries, months of recover...

The photo above is from my 19th birthday. I don't even really remember the circumstances that led me back to Chilliwack that weekend, but I actually do remember blowing those candles out, and being at the same condo where I graduated from high school. In that same condo I showered after a lot of rugby games, I did a lot of physics lab write-ups, and I even wrote my first song on my Fender strat after some girl stood me up. Sadly enough, I spent most of that night sitting in the dark on the couc...

                It's probably because it's been so nice these last few days at home, but I'm actually finding myself itching to shoot another wedding this summer. To that end, I've started assembling a wedding photography section. It needs a lot of work, but at least I have something for now until I can spend a bit more time on it....

                I gotta say -- I'm fairly amazed that it's still snowing on the west coast. I woke up to a white coating on the local mountains and houses here.

I actually spent a few years living in Ottawa, and one of the reasons I came back was because the weather was so much warmer out here. But this is without a doubt one of the craziest winters I can remember. Cultus Lake provincial park is only a few weeks away from opening, so it's pretty incredible that we're still plagued by this cold snap. I sure hop...

I was a tad hungover yesterday, more so because of the heat and lack of water than the beer, so I took it easy. Today is a pool day at one of our sister resorts, Coba. So I'm just going to read and relax.

Maybe it's because I always cross the border alone, or maybe there's something weird flagged on my account, but I always seem to get the nth degree.
The interview process was fairly straightforward, until of course they asked if I wanted th...

                Having driven over the Port Mann bridge probably close to a thousand times in my life, I'm pretty much an expert on how traffic works in that area. Years ago, in an effort to relieve some congestion for westbound traffic heading into Vancouver, the city created a dedicate HOV (high occupancy vehicle) lane that goes pretty much from the Port Mann bridge all the way to the Hastings exit downtown.

Unfortunately though, one of the characteristics of that lane is that it's rarely used to capacity. T...

                I just heard this on the news, and it's the kind of thing that makes my blood boil. The Hastings Racetrack is being forced to close for a month during the Olympics due to security concerns by VANOC. Lots of employees will be out of work, and some may even lose their jobs.
Given the Olympics are supposed to help the economy, it's rather ironic that VANOC is forcing some people out of work. Shouldn't the rights of the individual business owners be respected, regardless of what VANOC wants?...

Of them all, Lost is the only one that's really keeping me interested. I think the whole concept of 24 has just gone on too long now. I thought season two was pretty awesome, mainly because it focused on character development. Now it's more of an action flick.

                Obviously I've been spending a bit of time tweaking Apache such that it is well optimized for working in a VPS environment. Truthfully though, Apache is a major resource hog. To be honest, I really can't comprehend what it's doing with all that memory it seems to hoard. One of the other major downsides to Apache is that it forks additional processes to handle server load, and processes are rather heavy (at least when compared to user threads).
Since I haven't touched any C++ in about two months,...

                So I've had my website on Rimu for over a week now, and so far things are going quite well. I've actually had a few support requests in with them, mostly trivial items, and they've answered everything in about 30 minutes, which is great.
The one thing I've found out is that their base plan (which only included 160 MB of memory) just isn't powerful enough to run more than a small WordPress site. I spent a bunch of time reducing the memory requirements of Apache and MySQL, but my efforts just were...

Well, turns out this guy has it all figured out, at least for poplar trees. If you space them 10' x 10', you can get around 436 trees on an acre.

Most people don't realize it, but North America is one of the few places in the world that uses high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) to sweeten drinks and other items. Most other places in the world use pure glucose, which is the main sugar our bodies are built to run on. Fructose is far sweeter than glucose so you can use less of it to sweeten a product. High fructose corn syrup is typically composed of around 55% fructose and another 45% glucose. If you order a c...

                My friend Jason sent me a link to this video this morning, and I thought it was pretty cool. I contacted the guy who made it, and he gave me permission to show it here. It's a time lapse out a window during an airplane trip.

                At the current population growth rates, by the year 2500 people will be standing shoulder to shoulder on every piece of habitable land on this planet. So while our immediate problems have to do with global warming and obvious aggressions in various parts of the world, at some point population is going to become a focus as well.

It seems somewhat obvious to me that at some point there needs to be a type of population control on this planet. I've been racking my brain trying to figure out how to ...

                One of the major initiatives I've taken upon myself since moving back home is to actually eat at home for all of my meals. The last time I think I consistently ate three meals a day that I actually made for myself was probably back in high school.
Since moving out here, I'm happy to say that I've been fairly successful eating at home. It does take a lot of effort though, and I find I have to hit a grocery store every second day or so just to top up produce and what-not. The nice thing about bein...

                I saw this featured on a news program this morning, and thought it was pretty cool. It's a website where they track the progress of all of Barack Obama's campaign promises and see how he's doing on the Obameter. Check it out....

                I was over at Derek's blog this morning reading his article about the BC Liberal Party and their sponsorship of the Northern Voice social. Given that the BC Liberal Party was also a sponsor of WordCamp Whistler, and that I was one of the organizers, I thought I should share my thoughts on this.
First, I want to point out the logistics of an event like this. Organizing WordCamp Whistler was literally two months of solid work. A few days prior to the event I was fielding well over 100 emails a day...

                As I'm pretty beat, I'll post in more detail about WordCamp Whistler over the next few days. But I wanted to just say that it was a really great success in my opinion, and for the most part, went off without any hitches. I want to thank John Bollwitt and Rebecca Bollwitt for all their hard work over the last two months to help make it possible. I also want to thank all of the sponsors, speakers, and of course, the attendees who came up and made it a success.
