                Last night I went down to Malone's on Seymour street for a few after-work drinks with Kasia, Chris and Cisco. Afterwards, we decided to make our way down Granville (which eventually brings me home) and stopped by the Granville room for a bottle of wine. I ran into my old friend Brigitte and some of her friends which was a nice surprise. Unfortunately, I drank more than I should have, and had a nice headache most of the day.

I got tired of looking at my old theme about two days after I put it up, but just didn't feel like doing anything about it. So tonight while watching Million Dollar Baby, I decided to take a stab and making it a bit different.
It's nothing fancy -- all I did is start with the default Wordpress theme and add a few things here and there. The main header is a HDR sunrise I did off my patio about a month ago. Gravatars are bro...

Of course, having a high-definition TV without any sort of high-definition feed is rather pointless, so the first thing I did is pick up a HD cable box from Shaw. Unfortunately, I didn't realize at the time just how little TV I usually watch.

What's interesting about Kris, and a variety of the local photographers I've met recently, is that they have started shooting film again. Which is sort of surprising, given the focus local photography shops seem to place on digital nowadays (I ca...

                In the last couple days, I've read several reports of people discovering embedded user data in the new DRM-free versions of music on iTunes.
While I'm not suprised, having embedded user data within these files is essentially a form of Digital Rights Management, which at the very least points to false advertising by Apple regarding these new music files. I'm quite certain that a utility will exist shortly to strip it out, should people want to, but Apple is being very guarded about these files an...

                Yesterday Apple released verison 7.2 of iTunes which finally gives users the ability to download DRM free versions of songs from iTunes. The added bonus is that you can also download 256 kbps AAC versions of the files instead of the 128 kbps AAC versions.
So, before I actually go into the experience, I'd have to say I was slightly hesitant about this. When people think 128kbps, they automatically think of the old MP3s. And at 128kbps, MP3 files are fairly close to CD quality (for most people), b...
