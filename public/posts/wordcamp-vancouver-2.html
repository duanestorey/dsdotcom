For those of you who follow regularly, you'll remember that I was a co-organizer of WordCamp Whistler, which turned out to be a very well received event with an attendance of about 120 people, which is rather remarkable, given how expensive Whistler is and how far many people drove to be there.</p>
<p>In the past, I've helped put together a few small WordCamp Vancouver events, but the one we're planning is going to be a fairly large one I imagine. Right now we're exploring venues in the downtown area near the water, so hopefully people coming from out of town can be treated to some picturesque views of downtown. Right now the tentative date is June 12th, 2010.</p>
<p>I won't say anymore, since we still have lots to plan and discuss. You can follow along via email by subscribing from the main site at <a href="http://www.wordcampvancouver.com">wordcampvancouver.com</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/WordCampYVR">follow WordCampYVR</a> on Twitter. If you can help get the word out by Tweeting or blogging about this event, that would be great -- thanks!</p>
