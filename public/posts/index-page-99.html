                For those of you who are history buffs, John F. Kennedy was shot at 12:30 CST on November 22nd, 1963. I once spent a lot of time reading about JFK, years ago.
Also in the news lately is allegedly new evidence into the assassination of RFK at the Ambassador Hotel right after the California Primary in 1968. Some info about that assassination is here.
In 1976, the House Select Committee on Assassinations undertook an investigation into the deaths of JFK and Martin Luther King Jr. to help put the rest the publics' belief that these assassinations took place as a result of a conspiracy.

A few days ago, I mentioned that Kate's fiance was going to give me a second opinion about my injury. The official word back was that yes, I do have a orbital floor fracture in addition to a tripod fracture. I sent his opinion to my plastic surgeon, and he eventually agreed that I do have one and that it should also be fixed. Which raises sort of an interesting question -- how did the two or three doctors that looked at me initially not see this?
I managed to get a hold of the plastic surgeon I was dealing with at the hospital, and talked it over with him. He's sending me to an eye specialist ...

                Most of my swelling has finally gone down, which is good. I still have some blood left in my eye, but that's slowly going away too. Unfortunately, I have three problems left that don't seem to be subsiding:

I have a lot of sinus pressure on the left side of my face
I can't look upwards without seeing double vision
My left eye appears slightly sunken compared to my right eye

So, even though my doctor said just to chill out, I decided I'd contact him again today. I had to jump through alot of hoops to get a hold of the same guy who saw me 9 days ago, but I finally got to talk to him. Thankfully, ...

                I just got back from quickly picking up my fixed Canon SD630 camera. Apparently the warp-core phase-inverter was out of alignment, so I had to get that readjusted to the tune of $160. Seriously, those guys can turn any small problem into a huge one that can cost lots of money. I was originally told the shutter door was broken, which seemed somewhat reasonable (I pictured a really small, weak hinge breaking). However, now it's more along the lines of the "shutter solenoid ring was hosed." How does a shutter solenoid ring break? Better question, what the hell is a shutter solenoid ring anyways? ...

                Andie and I went and saw the Vancouver Canucks play the Chicago Blackhawks last night down at GM Place. It's the first hockey game I've really watched in its entirety this season. The Canucks played pretty good, and eventually won with a final score of 2-1.
A couple cool things happened at the game. My old friend Mike from Ottawa was there (I found out on IM earlier in the day), so Mike and I managed to text msg each other on our phones until we finally found ourselves catching up in front of 322 between the first and second periods.

                For those of you who live in Vancouver, by now you've heard that there's currently a water ban in effect for certain regions of the GVRD. You can read about this a bit more on Clay's Blog. The actual reason why the water is "bad" is apparently because of turbidity. What this basically means is that there is a lot of sediment in the water, and for some people, this can cause some problems in the toilet department.
What's a bit strange in all this is that there are lots of places in the world where turbid water is pretty common. Even in Saskatchewan, on my relative's farm (where their water supply ...

Afterwards, some of us met down at the Nelson St. Cafe. to see some live music. I originally went to see Melanie Dekker, but unfortunately, she played before we got there. However, the music was still pretty good, and I took some photos.

                A few days ago, Brennen and Jessica had their first baby. What's sort of interesting is that they had an ultrasound done to find out the baby's sex, and were told it was going to be a boy. So, they got lots of boys clothes, painted the room blue, picked out names, etc. But, at the hospital, they were treated to a baby girl.
I popped by for a while today to see their currently unnamed baby girl. What a cutie.

                So, about a month ago I decided that I was going to pull my guitar out of retirement and try to get better at it again. I've been playing for about ten years now, but realistically I only spent about a year or two actively playing it, so I really can't play anything tha complicated. But I decided I'm going to try and get better.
So, I've pulled out all my recent music and have been trying to play it on my guitar. The only problem is most of the stuff I have been listening to is rather tough to play for me on the guitar. Take John Mayer for example. He's a really good guitarist, inspired by greats ...

                So, I had my appointment today with the plastic surgeon. First, the bad news -- it will take between three and six months before I'll be able to feel my face again. Also, the double vision at the extremities needs to clear up on its own. If it doesn't I need to go back in a few months and go see an eye specialist.
Now the good news -- although my cheekbone *has moved*, it's only moved about 1mm or so (inwards I believe). So, they gave me the option of having surgery (which amounts to having three incisions -- one in my mouth, and two around my eyes -- and also having titanium plates and screws ...

I was sitting on the couch watching TV, when suddenly I felt a sneeze coming on. It really freaked me out, because I knew at that moment just how painful a sneeze would be. I couldn't stop it, and before I knew it my teeth were bashing together from the sneeze, and my whole head was in agony. That happened about three more times, and by the end of it I thought I was going to pass out. Luckily it hasn't happened again.

                Normally I'd be writing about Erin's wedding, posting some photos and saying what I good time I had. Unfortunately, something happened on the way home that night that sort of changed the focus of this blog entry. After the wedding, a few of us decided to go down to the Railway Club for a few more drinks. After it was over, everyone slowly made their way into cabs and headed back home. I was the last guy to get one, so since it was proving difficult to get a cab, I made my way into the store right beside the Railway Club and got some food. After I came out, I overheard three guys bugging three ...

                Ahh, I just got back from a night on the town with my ex-roommate Brigitte.. I had a great time -- it's always fun hanging out with a new crowd.
This afternoon, Erin stopped by work and gave me her wedding DVD for tomorrow. You see, Erin is a good friend of mine from Chilliwack.. Her last name is Stringer, and mine is Storey, so in our younger grades, we always got sat next to each other in classes where we got sit alphabetically. So, we sort of got to know each other over the years.. This summer, she met a really great guy, and she eloped to Vegas with him and got married. Tomorrow is a big wedding ...

                I was going through some old things tonight, and I came across a few tokens of my past that sort of reminded me how I first got into computers a long time ago. It all started back in Chilliwack, years ago, when my dad got picked up a Commodore 64. That was the first "real" computer that we had access to, and we both got into gaming. Chilliwack was pretty ahead of the curve, and they even opened up their own computer club that my dad and I dropped in on from time to time (oh yeah, we were cool). Not long after, I got my own C64, complete with the "fastload" cartridge, bringing game loading times ...

                It's sort of funny, because Jason and I were talking about this big bitch tonight. Apparently it's going to be making a brief appearance in Vancouver sometime in November. It truly is an engineering marvel, but I really don't want to go on it.
Why not? Well, firstly, it's 590 tons of reinforced plastic travelling at mach 0.85. Doesn't scare you? How about the fact that during the initial stress test of the new plane, the wings snapped in half. Maybe it will be safe, but considering that nobody really understands the failure modes of composite materials, and that at least one airplane has broken ...
