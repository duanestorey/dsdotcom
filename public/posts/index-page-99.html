                I spent a half hour tonight getting caught up on medical research. I try to read pubmed from time to time just so I know when my doctor is pitching crap to me or not.
This was an interesting recent study comparing diet composition with weight loss. I'm always surprised when I read research, because so much of it is bad, and the author's never want to go out on a limb and say what their research really means. For example, in the study I just linked to, 57 people went on diets, half on one type, h...

                So, I have bounced between a couple of ideas for Halloween this year, humming and hawing about what I was going to be. I woke up this morning and realized that I still didn't have a costume. Frantic, I started scanning around my living room for ideas.. And that's when it hit me.. on my floor, in a nice picture frame, was a picture I took in New York back in July.
A picture of the Statue of Liberty.
So, I spent this afternoon putting together a costume of the Statue of Liberty. I made a funky tor...

                I've been getting a lot of notices from Air Canada's Aeroplan recently. Apparently they have changed their policy so that air miles accumulated on airlines actually expire after a period of time. What that means is my airmiles from a long time ago are going to start disappearing off my statement in the near future.
So, I guess the easiest way to get around that is to cash them in sometime in the next 6 months and go somewhere. I don't really have a lot of vacation at work, so I'll probably just ...

Gotham is arguably Vancouver's finest steakhouse, and despite living here for 10 years or so, I had never been there. Steaks start at around $40, and go up to the $50 Porterhouse that I had. Apparently they cook them in some funky infrared chamber that can cook a steak in around 6 minutes. Anyways, it was fun, but I'm not sure my steak was worth $50.
Afterwards, we met up with Jason, Ecker and Derek for a few drinks. It was...

I cooked a few eggs up last night (hardboiled) so that I'd have a little snack in the fridge when I got hungry. But, unfortunately, cold hard boiled eggs just don't really do it for me. I figured -- why not just warm those puppies back up in the microwave before I eat them? Sounds like a good idea. So, I deshelled them and stuck two eggs in the microwave.
