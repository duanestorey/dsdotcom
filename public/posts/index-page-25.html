There wasn't really any big motivation for doing so, it was simply something I was used to doing from my old IRC chats. At one point though, I realized that it seemed a bit weird leaving big, technical comments on web-sites but not having my name associated with them. At the bare minimum, it felt like it lessened the impact of what I wrote if I use only my first name, or if used an alias.

                Yes, today is my mom's birthday. I lost count of how old she is years ago, but she'll always be 39 in our hearts.

Have a great day today mom! And hurry up and call me back so I can wish you Happy Birthday myself!...
