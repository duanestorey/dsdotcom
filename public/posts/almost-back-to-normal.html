            <p>It appears that things are almost back to normal with regards to my blog. I had to juggle the DNS entries around a bit the other day, and that caused a period of time where both versions of my blog existed on the internet for a while. I think for the most part most people will be directed to this one, which is the way it should be.</p>
<p>I went out last night to a roof top patio BBQ, courtesy of <a href="http://www.invokemedia.com/">Invoke Media</a>. I went along with <a href="http://www.blogaholics.ca">Arieanna</a>, <a href="http://hummingbird604.com">Raul</a> and Ianiv, and eventually we met up with <a href="http://www.lowtherrinserepeat.com/">Jenn</a> for some good conversation. Invoke has a pretty cool office, complete with a nice view of the North Shore mountains.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we all headed over to <a href="http://netchick.ca">Tanya's new condo</a> for some rock band. I arrived just in time to see <a href="http://hummingbird604.com">Raul</a> bust a beer bottle all over the floor, which happens to the best of us from time to time. I rocked the singing part of rock band by singing in the ever popular key of Duane-minor all night. Good times.</p>
<p>I actually was pretty beat last night, so I ended up bailing early and coming home. I don't really have any plans for today, except for the ever-lingering desire to hit up a theatre and watch the Dark Knight. Arieanna and Ianiv and I might hit it later tonight. I also might try and hit the Apple store to drop my laptop off, although given that I might be heading to Serbia for a month, I'm not sure I can handle them taking my laptop off my hands right now.</p>
