                    Friday afternoon I had yet another enlightening visit down at St. Paul's hospital. I actually went in rather grumpy and upset with the whole process, but about five minutes into it was greated by a really cute, friendly medical student. So, my spirits rose pretty quickly to the point where I was making light of the whole situation. It was actually rather funny, because the first little bit of dialog went like this:
Cute student: "so why are you here today?" Me: "I have no idea" Cute student: "what do you mean you have no idea? You came in." Me: "My doctor's office called me and said to come in. ...

                    Last night we had a mini drinking event at work where we said goodbye to Chris and Hanh. After consuming a few beers, we sat down and started to watch a bit of the hockey game. After the second period, Hesty and I ventured down Robson street on our way home and met up with John and Rebecca for a drink at a local restaurant.
This morning I woke up around 11am (and man, was it nice to sleep in), had a quick shower and hopped into the car headed for Chilliwack. It seems like it's been a really long time since I've been back home.

My dad and I went halfers on some homemade wine a while ago, and today ...

                    Tonight I found myself down in the gastown area, having a few beers with old pal Boris Mann down at the Bryght offices. He was nice enough to invite me to some of the Thursday night BBQ lovin at his offices, and introduced me to the ever-sought-after "Save On Meat" store around the corner from the offices.

Afterwards, I stuck around and hung out for the Drupal monthly Vancouver meetup and learned both about Drupal 6.0 and some of the Install Profile work that the guys at Bryght have contributed back. I'm in the process of setting up a new website with a different focus ...

                    As most of you know, I have been waiting anxiously to have my surgery performed down at St. Paul's. About two weeks ago, I had a meeting at the hospital with my surgeon (where I sat and waited for three hours just to sign a few forms) where we discussed the surgery date (which was supposed to be this week), and a few of the details. I called last Thursday to try and nail down an exact date, but they said they wouldn't be able to give me one.
So today, I called down to the doctor's office to find out what was going on. I was told that for some reason, nobody even submitted my name into the queue ...

My research was primarily in the area of high definition video compression, specifically on a new codec called H.264 that is used in the new HD DVD formats such as Blue-Ray and HD-DVD. I proposed a novel scheme to combine concurrently broadcoast MPEG-2 standard definition (SD) streams with H.264 spatial difference information to create a HD broadcast stream at a reduced ...

                    I've been experimenting with high dynamic range (HDR) images for a few months now, and so far I really love the effect that you can get with photos. At least in my eyes, HDR images generally seem to look a bit more natural than a typical shot that doesn't have a large dynamic range. Unfortunately, this whole field is more of an art than a science currently, so getting the perfect HDR shot is a bit of trial and error (and in a lot of cases, the end result isn't always appealing).
My tool of choice right now is undoubtedly Photomatix, and I use it almost exclusively when generating HDR shots. I've ...

                    As of this moment, I am officially "on call" for my next surgery at St. Paul's hospital. I was hoping that I would have gotten the call on Sunday night for a Monday morning surgery (I just want it over with), but unfortunately I still haven't had the call yet. I won't be able to eat for twelve hours prior, so I'm pretty much guaranteed to get at least that much notice. It would be nice if they could give more notice than that, but apparently the hospitals are rather busy, and it's difficult to book them in advance.

But I can't for the life of me manage to lock it from the outside.

So basically, I'm stuck at home until I can figure out a way to get it fixed. The obvious answer is to call a locksmith and get him/her to come fix it. But it's Sunday, which probably means it's going to be a major pain in the ass to sort out. I've been trying to ...

From there, we made our way to the Yaletown Brew Pub for dinner and some more drinks. I wasn't really sure what these guys would like to see (apparently at the end of the night it turns out they kind of wanted to see a strip club, affectionately called "The Titty Bar" in Finnish), so I sort of did a mini pub crawl with them. After YBC, we decided to hit up Glowbal ...

                    Tonight I had the unusual desire to spend some time working on my blog. The last theme that was up was 100% written by me entirely from scratch. And while I really liked it when it went up, I've grown a bit tired of it. So for now, I'm using the Balance theme from the internet. It has a lot of cool Ajax features, and even supports Gravatars in the blog comments. If you don't have a gravatar, I suggest you head on over and get one.
So instead of reinventing the wheel with my own theme, I think my current plan is to spend some time extending this one with some of the cool features I've been thinking ...

                    Even though I spent quite a bit of time working on my last theme, I've grown rather tired of it. So, after checking out some themes on the net tonight, I found this one which I rather like. I think I'm going to modify it a bit and put up a new version for people to download. ...

                    Most people who know me nowadays would probably be a bit surprised to learn that I used to be a big literature buff, particularly with old english poetry. I guess it all started back around grade 10. I had done pretty well in school, and had been recommended to take advanced placement calculus and physics. Because of that, and of my high marks in english I guess, I was put on a list that recommended I be enrolled in a new AP Literature class at our school. So for kicks, I said "why not"?
And to be honest, looking back, it's probably the class I enjoyed the most. I studied some of the greats such ...

                    The first news of the day is that yesterday after work I picked up a new set of glasses. I still haven't finalized all the insurance papers that will let me get a refund on the first pair, but at least I'm no longer without a pair of glasses. The ladies at the eyeglass center were nice enough to remind me to remove them whenever I decided to step out, have a few drinks and then fall down.
Unfortunately, in the process of falling the first time, I seemed to have gotten the world's largest splinter. To make it worse, it entered at the tip of my finger, and proceeded to go down the length of the ...

                    Did a quick HDR off my patio before bed. And before I drop off, here's one more bit of info -- my dad and step-mom are getting on a plane at 7am to spend a week near Cancun relaxing. They usually spend most vacations every year in the RV camping somewhere, and this is the first trip that they've taken to a far-away place (except of course when they came to visit me out in Ottawa). So, I hope they have a really awesome time down there.

Also, Jari and Seppo should be stepping off a plane any time soon to spend the week up here in Vancouver. These are the two Finnish guys I got loaded with during ...

                    So as the sun went down over downtown this evening, I thought it might be a neat idea to try and make a HDR panorama. I've done this a few times using my PC, but never using my new Macbook Pro. I took a series of 20 shots and merged them together using the Mac panorama software DoubleTake. Afterwards, I created the final HDR using Photomatix.
Here's the end result.

The HDR process went smoothly, but DoubleTake did a rather poor job of aligning the images. Part of the reason may have been that it thought the focal length of my lens was 26mm, even though it actually was a 17mm lens. However, you ...

                    Ever since my injury in November, I have spent quite a bit of time in hospitals, doctor's offices, and medical clinics. Part of those visits usually involves some interaction with medical students.
And while I'm certain that there really are good medical students out there who are passionate about helping people and eager to learn more in their field, almost every single medical student I've encountered has been both arrogant and misinformed, a deadly combination when you're trying to help people who are sick or have undergone significant trauma.
My first encounter came sometime around November ...
