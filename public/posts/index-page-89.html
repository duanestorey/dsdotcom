                First, I have to apologize for my lack of interesting blog entries lately. I have a few on my mind that I might get around to writing this weekend, hopefully some of which will be informational and humourous.
I spent tonight walking down the beach with my camera snapping photos. The sunset photo below was one of a few that I ended up liking. One thing that I've noticed lately is that everyone I know that uses flickr, including me, seems to be on a bit of a break. I used to log in every night and...

                This is without a doubt one of the most horrible things I have read in a while.

Watcharaporn Boonmak, 26, was ambushed by gunmen as she rode her motorcycle through a Muslim village in Yala, one of the three southern provinces roiled by three years of separatist insurgency in which more than 2,000 people have been killed.
"She might have been shot in the stomach before they set fire to her and her motorcycle," a Yala police officer, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters by telephone.

                For some reason, as this weekend approaches, I find myself yearning to get in the car and simply disappear for a few days.. I'm actually in a really good mood, just with the sun shining and the air warming, I feel like going on a little road trip.
The only problem is that I don't really want to blow a lot of money. I have no problem camping if I have to, but I'm looking for somewhere to go that's not more than a three or four hour drive. Anyone have any suggestions?...

                So, I was reading my buddy Joey's website when I stumbled across a recent article of his. It shows a video of him riding a bike when he was a kid, and of course, in typical kid fashion, hurting himself. When I saw this, I was reminded of a similar accident I had when I was a kid. My sister tied my wagon onto the back of her bike and was pulling me up and down Wiltshire street in Chilliwack. I was having a great time, probably because I was wearing my bright green boots and my tacky overalls. Out...

                For those of you who read regularly, you'll know that I've been striving to wake up earlier in the morning, and get home from work earlier in the evening. For the most part, throughout my life, I have been a night owl. I have always found it rather peaceful at 1 or 2am in the morning, and used to get some of my best school work done then. However, in the last little while I've found it rather depressing getting home at 8pm, eating dinner, and basically not having very much "regular" time to do n...

                As I mentioned in my last post, I somehow managed to lose my glasses at Honey on my birthday night. Since I only had them for two days, I was obviously a bit bummed about what happened to them. However, both Brennen and Hesty suggested I call my Visa company (since I used my Visa to do the purchase) and see if there is anything they can do.
So surprisingly, my Visa policy actually has a clause that covers loss or damage for any new item for a period of 90 days. What that means is that they are g...

                Well, it's now official -- not only am I officially 30, but I have also survived my 30th birthday party. Thanks to everyone who came out to enjoy a few beers. In my case, thanks to all the shots, I drank way more than I'm used to. While I had a great time, unfortunately I slipped down the stairs at Honey and lost my glasses long enough for a few people to step on them. So, apparently I'll be visiting the eyeglass store this week to put in a new order.
Thanks everyone who popped by.

                Well, in just a few hours, yours truly will be turning 30. I originally set out last night to write something memorable, and spent a few hours writing a blog entry that I hoped would detail the last ten years of my life. However, upon waking up this morning, I realized that it wasn't really what I wanted to say, probably because I think it was heavily influenced by the events of the last six months.
The truth is, this has probably been the hardest year of my life. Between a big breakup, that ass...

My friend Kris met them while he was at SXSW a few weeks ago and had a few drinks with the guys. He had said they were coming to town shortly, but it had slipped my mind until the end of the day today.

                So that stupid opacity problem has finally pissed me off enough to start to do something about it. There has to be a bug in my theme somewhere that's doing it, but I haven't been able to pinpoint it exactly. For now I'm switching to this theme, even thought it's a bit buggy too (it's only temporary)..
Actually, after disabling my theme and all plugins, the problem still exists in other themes.. I've only noticed it on my mac using Camino or Firefox, so I wonder if there's something wrong there.....
