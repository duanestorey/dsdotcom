                I actually remember last year about this time, when I hit the 40 mark. It's a good feeling, mainly because everyone can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

                Tomorrow should be an interesting day. We're going to leave Workspace here sometime around 6am. With any luck, I'll be fast asleep sometime around 6:15am. Tomorrow there's a baby shower on the north shore that I'd really like to attend, so as of now I'm hoping to hit that.

To give you some context, Vancouver has demonstrated that it is at the forefront of social media. Many people here without true old-school media credentials have covered many events as members of the press. Rebecca has covered a lot of events simply as a representative of her website, Dave O has covered a few different Olympics, and I've covered a few music events...

                Seems like the Blogathon gods are mad, and are punishing those people on Vancouver's north shore who weren't blogging today. From my vantage point, it's pretty gloomy over there. We've been watching lightening strikes for a while hit the mountains over there. While John Biehler thinks he's safe, I'm pretty sure he's in for a world of hurt over there, but we'll see.

Unfortunately, I didn't have a tripod, so I basically experimented all night with settings that would allow me to handhold a fireworks shot. I ended up with a few keepers, but a lot of the ones I shot ended up being a bit blurry (which is why a tripod is usually preferable).

                It's slow, but the sun is slowly going down out here in Vancouver, which means we're not only past the half-way point, but it'll soon be dark. I imagine it'll be a lot harder to stay awake when it gets dark here, but who knows. Here's my current view in Vancouver:
