                Yesterday after work I was thinking to myself that I have never seen Vancouver from up high really, except for on Grouse Mountain late at night. I've been up the CN Tower in Toronto and the Empire State Building and Rockafeller Center in NYC, but never up in the harbour center. So, last night I grabbed my camera and went to check out what Vancouver looks like at night....

No, I will not be starting any fires in Vancouver with the heat from my birthday cake, but I will be drinking no doubt in some bar somewhere with some of my friends. 30 is a really a strange birthday.

A few emails have been passed around, and some of those have ultimately lead into online conversations via IM. What bothers me the most is that there's this trend where people initiate a chat with you, and then are either too busy or too uninterested to spend time chatting. For example, this one girl will always IM me whenever she sees me and ask to chat. So I say sure...

When that happened, I was fortunate enough to stumble across a little website called KatKam.ca. It's a live webcam that points into the direction of the evening sunset, only a block or so away from my apartment in Vancouver. To this day, I always religiously check it out from time to time when I'm out of town, just to see what I'm missing back home.

                I've had an iPod now for probably at least two years. On my birthday, Des picked me up one of those iPod Minis back when they first came out. And as I sit here, on my couch, patiently waiting for it to charge enough so it will make the rainy walk to work, I thought I'd reflect a bit on the iPod.
Since I usually walk wherever I go downtown, I pretty much take the iPod with me when I can. I'm sure I'm going to be part of that generation that goes prematurely deaf since I'm somehow genetically incl...

                I met with my plastic surgeon this morning, and as I thought, we're going to go ahead and do another surgery. The apparent source of my problem seems to be that the ledge that was supporting the implant ended up not being very stable, and the implant has collapsed slightly along with my eye. Also, there is slight herniation of some of orbital contents into my sinus near the back, which is most likely the source of my double vision.
The good news is that it should be nearly 100% fixable. They are...
