            <p>I just got back in from a nice evening out at a friend's house, and I'm a bit tired. I was going to wait until the morning to write something, but now is probably as good as any.</p>
<p>Last night a bunch of us from work decided to get together and have a few beers. Unfortunately for me, a few beers turned into a pile of beers, a few rums, some wine, more rums, and finally some drunken blogging. All and all, a good night out, but I'm definitely getting too old to drink at that pace anymore.</p>
<p>I spent most of today lounging around my house, cleaning a bit, eating a bit, but for the most part I just took it easy. Kasia invited me over to her place for dinner, and I spent most of the night lying on her couch, drinking wine and watching chick flicks. It was really nice to just spend a night away from computers or heavy drinking and just chill out for a change.</p>
<p>As I was putting my shoes on, I realized that it was the end of the last Saturday of being 29. In less than a week, I will break the 30 year old barrier, and kiss what's left of adolescence behind. It's somewhat fitting that it will occur on a Saturday, and on a long weekend. I've been thinking for quite a long time about what I want to blog about on that day, and although I haven't written anything yet, I feel like there's a really important blog entry that's waiting to emerge at the end of this week. There's so much I want to say, and so much that has happened in the last ten years that I haven't had the chance to get off my chest.</p>
<p>So, check back at the end of this next week and hopefully I will have written something worth reading. Tomorrow I think I'll wake up slowly, drink some coffee, and make my way out to white rock to hang out with Brennen and Jessica for a change.</p>
