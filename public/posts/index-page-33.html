I've been fairly lucky in that I don't really have many grey hairs yet. Many of my friends starting getting their first grey hairs in university. While I have a few now, they've only recently emerged. Grey hairs don't really bother me, but joint pain and random aches do.

A few years ago I read a book called The 4-Hour Work Week: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich, an interesting book by Tim Ferris. Since that time, I've seen Tim talk at least once (maybe twice?), and have read a few other books with similar concepts as the ones presented by Tim.
