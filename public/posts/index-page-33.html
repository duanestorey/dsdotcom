                I took a quick break this afternoon from work and decided to hash out a quick Wordpress plugin that would push my blog entries into my Twitter feed. The end result is WordTwit, and it's available for download if anyone wants to try it on their Wordpress blog.
Drop me a comment or two and let me know what you think....

                I've really been trying hard to get a new release of Crossroads out for quite some time, but with my job at work, it's just so hard to find a few hours to spare these days. That being said, I've up-reved the plugin to version 2.0, and am making the changes I've done available as a download. This is an early alpha, and for sure it has a few bugs, so please don't expect it to be perfect.

I've been fortunate enough to be able to afford a really nice camera and a full suite of lenses, and while I sort of understand what's needed to take "good" photos, my camera really does the majority of the heavy lifting.

If you want to see the iPhone at an Apple store, be sure to bring some cash. Large crowds flocking to see the iPhone and next generation iPods have forced Apple to begin charging a $5 entrance fee for Apple stores. Many analysts anticipated the move, and expect...

Blockbuster recently announced an exclusive deal with Blue-Ray so that they would only carry Blue-Ray titles.

                So I found out something pretty cool on Friday night with Wordpress. It was around 11pm and I wanted to put a new post up but have the date say the next day at 1 minute past midnight. The idea being that I could post Saturday's photo of the day Friday night before I went to bed. However, once I modified the timestamp in Wordpress and published the article, it didn't show up at all, which I thought a bit odd at first.
However, after reading through the documentation, Wordpress has the ability to ...

                My dad suggested that it might be a cool idea to have a theme every once and a while. So this week, I've decided to make the theme:
REFLECTIONS
The idea is that you should take photos of the world that show some type of reflection. Be inventive, but some ideas are puddles, lakes, mirrors, glass, spoons, anything that casts a reflection. Send them in and I'll try to put them all in a group somewhere to reflect everyone's efforts!
While not a stellar example, I took a shot today of some buildings ...

After a few clicks, I came across one site, and immediately noticed that they had used a bunch of my photos in their blog entry.

Unlike some of his other movies, he doesn't spend a lot of time quoting facts or statistics, which for some people might lead to a less effective argument. But considering most of the statistics can be found by spending a few minutes on the Internet, and Michael Moore is probably...
