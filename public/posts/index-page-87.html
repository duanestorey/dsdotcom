                    As I was browsing the internet tonight and accidentally ran into a photo of mine on a website. So, while I was there, I figured I might as well see where else some of my photos have ended up.

Chris Blackburn used one of my HDR shots in a blog posting
A shot of Boris used in a blog entry
My HDR shot of Kitsilano used on the Kitsilano.ca website
My aurora shots on the NASA website
A photo of Rebecca on her blog
Las Vegas Travel Blog

As I was tracking these down in Google, I realized how nice a feature it would be if Flickr had some sort of trackback mechanism, then you could see who was using ...

                    Last night I went down to Malone's on Seymour street for a few after-work drinks with Kasia, Chris and Cisco. Afterwards, we decided to make our way down Granville (which eventually brings me home) and stopped by the Granville room for a bottle of wine. I ran into my old friend Brigitte and some of her friends which was a nice surprise. Unfortunately, I drank more than I should have, and had a nice headache most of the day.

Tomorrow I'm going to head into work for a bit and catch up on a few things, and then Sunday I'm heading out to Chilliwack to hang out with my family for father's day. I'm ...

                    As you can see, things look a little different around here after tonight. I got tired of looking at my old theme about two days after I put it up, but just didn't feel like doing anything about it. So tonight while watching Million Dollar Baby, I decided to take a stab and making it a bit different.
It's nothing fancy -- all I did is start with the default Wordpress theme and add a few things here and there. The main header is a HDR sunrise I did off my patio about a month ago. Gravatars are broken right now, but since Keira and I seem to be the only ones using them, it's not really any big hardship. ...

                    Nearly two years ago, I went out with my dad and step-mom and picked up a high-definition TV at future shop. Of course, having a high-definition TV without any sort of high-definition feed is rather pointless, so the first thing I did is pick up a HD cable box from Shaw. Unfortunately, I didn't realize at the time just how little TV I usually watch.
Between the HD cable option and my "high-speed" internet, I shell out around $110 a month, which is pretty stupid considering I watch only around one TV show a week if I'm lucky. So, I think tomorrow I'm going to call up shaw and finally cancel my ...

                    So, I gotta hand it to my pal Kris -- he's managed to get me interested in something I never thought I'd be interested in again -- film photography. Kris is a really awesome fashion photographer here in Vancouver, and his stuff never ceases to amaze me.
What's interesting about Kris, and a variety of the local photographers I've met recently, is that they have started shooting film again. Which is sort of surprising, given the focus local photography shops seem to place on digital nowadays (I called several local stores recently to talk about film, and most of them didn't even have film cameras ...

Before I get into it, I'm going to state, for the record, that my ex-girlfriend and I fought over this topic on more than a few occasions. You see, about four months into the relationship, I started noticing a lot of wedding material around her house ...

I spent the weekend up at Cultus Lake with John and Rebecca, and I had a great time - check out Rebecca's entry for all the details.

We strolled around the tracks is Gastown, then made a loop around and came back through Blood Alley. Afterwards, we stopped at the Six Acres for some beers, and then eventually went to Kris' house for a little wine.

                    In the last couple days, I've read several reports of people discovering embedded user data in the new DRM-free versions of music on iTunes.
While I'm not suprised, having embedded user data within these files is essentially a form of Digital Rights Management, which at the very least points to false advertising by Apple regarding these new music files. I'm quite certain that a utility will exist shortly to strip it out, should people want to, but Apple is being very guarded about these files and exactly just how DRM-free they really are.
I personally have no problem with my user data being embedded, ...

                    Yesterday Apple released verison 7.2 of iTunes which finally gives users the ability to download DRM free versions of songs from iTunes. The added bonus is that you can also download 256 kbps AAC versions of the files instead of the 128 kbps AAC versions.
So, before I actually go into the experience, I'd have to say I was slightly hesitant about this. When people think 128kbps, they automatically think of the old MP3s. And at 128kbps, MP3 files are fairly close to CD quality (for most people), but on my stereo at least, I can notice slight distortions. However, AAC is part of the MPEG4 standard ...

                    I remember back around Christmas, Sony announced that they were unable to meet the holiday demand for the PS/3. I suspect part of this may have been artificial, since the resulting huge line-ups across the country showered the company with press everywhere. Unfortunately, those events lead to the deaths of a few people in incidents that occurred while in the long line-ups in sometimes cold, outdoor conditions.
During that period, I had passively walked into whatever electronics store I could find, and asked if they had a PS/3 for sale. The answer was always no.
So here we are, nearly six months ...

                    On Friday, I met up briefly with Rebecca down at the Six Acres in Gastown for a few drinks on a patio. It was a good way to start a Friday afternoon, and since I had only woken up a few hours prior, I was definitely in the mood to drink and grab something to eat. Afterwards, we went down to the west-end for some pizza, and to hang out with John, who was busy playing with Dave Olsen's new microphone on his computer.
A bunch of my new blogger-type friends (most of which I originally ran into down at Northern Voice) were down at DemoCamp the other day, but unfortunately I wasn't feeling up to venturing ...

                    After I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, I decided that for the first time in a long time, I wanted to live relatively close to work. Some people argue that if you had to choose, you should always choose to live where you play (as opposed to living where you work). But, I spent the last few years having nearly an hour commute in each direction to go to work, and I was just sick of it.
So, I found a place downtown, and here I am, after nearly two years. I have a pretty sweet deal down here - I pay $1200 for an 800 sq. ft. apartment about 20 steps from the water, in a relatively nice area of downtown. ...

                    Last night I ventured out for dinner briefly down to Granville Island with Jason, and managed to enjoy a bit of the sunshine. I haven't really been sleeping that well lately (yesterday I didn't get to sleep until 8am, waking up sometime around 3pm), so I think my lack of sleep has finally caught up with me (I was up at 5am this morning after only sleeping a few hours). Maybe it's the drugs leaving my system, or maybe just some stuff on my mind -- I'm not sure.
The good news is that in about three hours I'll be down at UBC getting my stitches out. I'm excited because I'll finally be able to see ...

                    I realized this morning that I haven't really written a blog entry in quite a few days. Truth is, I've just been feeling a little under the weather with the surgery and everything. I'm definitely healing, even though my face is a weird shade of yellow now. I don't really feel that much pain since the left side of my face is still completely numb, but my eye socket hurts from time to time. The last few days I've woken up in the morning with extremely itchy eyes, and have spent the better part of 20 minutes just trying to get them to stop watering. I'm not sure what causes that (probably the body's ...

                    So tonight John and Rebecca stopped by for some moral support, and we spent the night hanging out, eating BBQ food, watching Trailer Park Boys, listening to music, and of course, having some drinks. It was a really awesome night, and I laughed enough that my face really, really hurts now. I'm definitely chewing two T3's before bed.
I'll be spending the rest of the weekend close to home, watching movies and hopefully relaxing. ...
