            <p>Well, the time has come for me to give up caffeine once again. Why you might ask? Because I'm way too addicted to it, and I know how completely shitty it is for the body. Here are some reasons why caffeine sucks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It disrupts REM sleep, making you feel tired in the morning</li>
<li>It increases cortisol, making you feel stressed out</li>
<li><a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-03/20/content_426548.htm">It distrupts the body's glucose system, increasing insulin levels by as much as 50%</a></li>
<li>It makes weight loss difficult since the body can't burn fat with high levels of insulin in the blood</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with working in a high tech industry is that there's free pop. So, instead of just grabbing a cup of water, I usually grab a diet coke. Which is just so wrong.</p>
<p>Some time this morning, <a href="http://twitchy67.wordpress.com/">Clay</a> came up to my desk and noticed the two diet coke cans I had on my desk. He was like "yo man, you should really give that shit up -- it's not good for you." And he's right. I sat there thinking as he left -- thinking about my dad in the hospital, thinking about the brown liquid shit I put into my body everyday and decided he was right - it was time to give it up. So, I had my last can of diet coke around noon today.</p>
<p>I gave up caffeine once before, so I know just how hellish the next few days are going to be. Tomorrow should be ok, but sometime on Thursday I can fully expect to be in full withdrawl, complete with a splitting headache and the need to vomit. I really feel like I need to do this though, and start making changes in my life for the better.</p>
<p>The unfortunate part to this is that in an effort to stay away from carby/sugary drinks, I usually have a rum and diet coke. But diet coke has caffeine in it, so that drink is toast. Wine might be ok for a while, but it's not really a pub drink. Anyone have any suggestions for other drinks?</p>
