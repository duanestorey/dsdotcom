                <p>I just <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/02/news/companies/automakers_plans/index.htm?postversion=2008120210">read this article</a> which talks about how the executives at Ford are willing to cut their salaries to $1 if they receive money from the federal government. Wow, that's nice of them.</p>
<p>Notably absent in that entire article is a mention of executive bonuses. Bonuses and dividends are typically taxed as investments instead of income, and usually result in a smaller tax burden. In Canada, the tax rate on dividends is roughly half of what it is in regular income, so that's the preferred method of making money.</p>
<p>So if they reduce their salaries to $1, I gotta ask, what are they planning to do with their bonuses? Unless it's explicity stated what they will be, I really doubt the sincerity of this gesture, and would fully expect those executives to make up the difference with their normal bonus plans.</p>
<p>Updated at 4:15pm on Dec 2, 2008 - See, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/02/news/companies/automakers_plans/index.htm?postversion=2008120217">I told you so</a>. Here is a list of the executive packages from last year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mulally had a base salary of $2 million and total compensation of <strong>$21.7 million last year</strong>, according to the company's filings. Wagoner received base pay of $1.6 million and total compensation of <strong>$14.4 million</strong>. Closely-held Chrysler does not disclose executive pay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So by changing their salaries to $1, they are in essence only giving themselves about a 10% reduction in compensation. Wow, some sacrifice guys.</p>
