                <p>This will be a short entry, but I just wanted to say how great this place is. The people I've met have been super friendly, and the weather is pretty amazing. I took a pile of photos yesterday from around the pool.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, upon waking up this morning, I've encountered some fairly serious camera problems. The first is that my DLSR body refuses to turn on now. It was working last night when I went to sleep, but now it just refuses to do anything. I suspect that due to the heat and humidity it's being stubborn, but it's not looking good right now. The other serious issue is that my 70-200mm f/2.8L is full of water vapour. I have no idea how that happened, since it was in my bag the entire day, and my bag wasn't really near the pool. I was taking shots with the 17-40mm f/4L all day, and that one is completely fine. What sucks is that the L-series lenses are Canon's professional line, and they are supposed to be weather sealed so things like that can't happen.</p>

<p>So, as of right now, I'm completely cameraless. I didn't even bring my back-up film body, so I'm stuck trying to sort this out. I'm going to put everything under the A/C this afternoon for a few hours and see if that helps, but I suspect both the camera body and the lens will require servicing when I get back to Canada. If the body has been damaged by water, it's probably close to being a write-off. That's not completely bad, since I've been saving for a new body this year anyways. The lens however needs to be fixed, as it's my favourite one in my kit, and costs $1600 new. I'll keep everyone up to date.</p>
<p>I'm gonna head back to my room and read for a while and try to air out my camera. After that, I'm not sure -- maybe head to the plaza to see about going on a trip tomorrow somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Update - the DLSR body appears to be working again. A little time under the A/C seems to have recharged it. The lens is pretty screwed though, so I dunno what to do about that. I still don't really understand how it happened.</strong></p>
