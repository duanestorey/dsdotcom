                <p>I gotta admit, my brain is oatmeal right about now. I know it's working because I can still type, but it's not being very cooperative. My typing has been reduced from my usual 100 word per minute down to about 15, and every sentence is ripe with spelling errors.</p>
<p>But no matter. The finish line is looming in the distance, and I've already (thanks to everyone here) reached the original goal of $1,000 I set before I started. So a big thanks is in order! I'm actually going on the radio Monday morning to report how well we all did for the BC Children's Hospital, so it will be great to say we did over $1,000 (and even better if we can ramp it up a bit more!)</p>
<p>But either way, it's a success for this effort, and a success for the children at the BC Children's Hospital. So thanks to everyone who was involved.</p>
