                <p>A few people convinced me to finally ante up and get a house keeper, since a) my place is usually messy and b) I don't really have much time to spend cleaning.</p>
<p>She's in the bathroom right now, and she stepped out for a brief second to say: "wow, you're pretty messy eh?" with a cute smile.</p>
<p>I think I can get used to having cute girls come to my place every few weeks and clean. Thankfully my place is going to be (and stay) spotless after all this.</p>
<p>One girl came on Friday to clean the living room and kitchen, but ran out of time before finishing it all off (due to a prior constraint). So, the other girl is here now finishing it all off.</p>
<p>At first, the whole idea of spending money to have someone clean my place seemed a bit pretentious, but having lived in a really clean kitchen and living room this weekend, it's really pretty awesome reading a book on the couch in a clean and fresh smelling room. Since I suck at cleaning, it easily takes me 3 or 4 hours a week to keep my apartment in a somewhat screwed up state. So, paying someone $100 a month to free up that time each week to do something else is a pretty good investment I'm thinking.</p>
