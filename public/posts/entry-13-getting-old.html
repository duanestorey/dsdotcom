                <p>I'm no old timer yet, but I'm definitely past the point where'd I'd consider myself a spring chicken. This year is really the first year where I've noticed any grey hairs, and is also the first year where I'm starting to recognize the odd pain. One in particular, a sharp pain in the heel on my left foot, tends to cause me some grief. Years ago I jumped off a big wall and landed pretty hard on my feet. I never got it looked at, but I'm fairly certain I cracked my heel bone, since I basically had to limp for around four weeks. Unfortunately, I now wake up with a sharp pain in the same area, one that takes me about five minutes to walk off in the mornings.</p>
<p>I also seriously injured my knee on the West Coast Trail years ago. I never got it officially looked at, but I occasionally get a burning sensation under my knee cap whenever I start climbing uphill. I've also notice that my eyesight is getting a bit worse recently as well. While I have prescription glasses, I rarely wear them, mainly because I'm farsighted and can see most things fine. But I also have a slight astigmatism, and I believe that's getting a bit worse. So I'll probably have to visit and eyedoctor sometime soon and get them checked again.</p>
<p>So, there's no need to take me out back and put me out of my misery yet, but I'm definitely conscious of the fact that I'm not 18 years old anymore, even though I'd like to pretend I am.</p>
