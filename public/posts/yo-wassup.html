                <p>So, here I am, in San Francisco. I've actually been here a pile of times before, and I always find something new and unique about it every time I'm here.</p>
<p>We actually went out for some wicked Mexican food tonight. The guacamole was $15 USD, but it was totally worth it. I've had some great guac in my time (thanks Keira), but this was probably right up there as some of the best I've ever tasted, and it was a really great meal.</p>
<p>Dale arrived from Toronto at around 11pm, and him and I went on for a few drinks in Union Square. We're back at the hotel now trying to sober up before WordCamp SFO tomorrow morning. It's 2:20am now, and we have to be at the conference center at around 8:00am, so I have to get to sleep shortly. Tomorrow there's a big party down at Pier 38 here in SFO, and then Monday I'm heading back to Chilliwack (via Seattle and Vancouver).</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm beat, so I'm going to bed.</p>
