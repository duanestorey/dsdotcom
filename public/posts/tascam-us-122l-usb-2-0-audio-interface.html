                <p>I've been playing guitar since I was about 18 years old. My first guitar was actually (believe it or not) a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. It was basically my high school present from my mom in exchange for graduating and getting myself to UBC. Unfortunately, I really couldn't afford an amplifier at the time, so I basically just practiced on it ampless for the first few years. Eventually I managed to save some cash and bought a Fender Princeton 112 amplifier, which I still have (although it's been at my friend's house for a few years now -- something I've been trying hard to remedy for about two years now).</p>
<p>My second guitar was actually just a cheap acoustic I picked up here in Chilliwack in my early 20s, mainly so I'd have something to play while camping. It was really hard to play, and it always sounded a bit out. Despite that, it was my primary guitar for most of my 20s.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3501/3277815726_abe46d6108.jpg?v=0" alt="" />Upon moving back to Chilliwack, I decided to treat myself to something a bit better, and went guitar shopping again. I actually went with the intention of getting a Larrivee guitar or a cheap Taylor, but just couldn't part with the money at the time. So instead, I found a really nice sounding jumbo Takamine acoustic electric, and decided to make due with that for a while. It actually sounds really sweet, and I've been really happy with it. That being said, since I've been playing so much recently, I'm already thinking about getting something a little nicer.</p>
<p>About a year ago I picked up a USB condenser microphone from Tom Lee in Vancouver, and started toying around with Garage Band. The Samson microphone I purchased (which was around $120) actually sounded really nice, but it was kind of a pain to use with GarageBand, mainly because I didn't have a proper microphone mount for it. So when I bought my new guitar, I also decided to pick up some better recording equipment.</p>
<p>The first item I picked up was a Tascam US-122L USB 2.0 Audio Interface. I actually looked at quite a few different units, including some higher end M-Audio ones, but decided to get the Tascam after talking to a few people who said it really had more bang for the buck than the M-Audios (something that online reviews also agreed with). Second, since the Tascam can supply phantom power, I picked up a real condenser microphone along with a proper microphone stand.</p>
<p>I haven't spent much time recording with the unit yet, but it seems to do the job nicely. It has two separate channels, both of which are selectable in GarageBand. There are a few different settings on the unit, such as volume, amplification and impedance settings, and controls for the phantom power.</p>

I'm really not sure where I'm going to end up, but driving down the Oregon coast is sounding pretty nice right about now.</p>
