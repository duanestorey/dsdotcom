                <p>I read about this when I woke up: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/12/05/ny.trans.fat.ap/index.html">Trans Fat Banned in NYC</a>. I think that's pretty interesting actually. It opens up a lot of research opportunities since as far as I know it's the only place that's banned trans fat to such a large degree. I'm not sure I entirely agree with it though. I think most people know trans fat is bad, so I think putting it on the menu is good enough. Trans fat basically came about because the FDA thought it was super healthy years ago, and made everyone switch from animal/vegetable fats to trans fats. So, everyone, including my family, went out and switched from butter to margerine, thinking it was good for us.</p>
<p>Now of course, years later, everyone figures out trans fat is way worse than saturated or unsaturated fat (since currently research points to it actuallys lowering good cholesterol and raising bad cholesterol). So, if they got it wrong once, what's to say they won't get it wrong again? I think they are subjecting the people of NYC to one of the largest controlled experiments in history, so I hope they know what they are doing.</p>
<p>Eggs are good.. No wait, eggs are bad. Trans fat is good. No wait, trans fat is bad. Or are they good? Carbs are good for you because they are low fat. Oh wait, they raise blood sugar and cause diabetes.</p>
