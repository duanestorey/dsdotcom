                <p>Update - Hotwire came through for me again. We're going to be staying at the <a href="http://www.magnoliahotel.com">Magnolia Luxury Boutique Hotel</a> right in Inner Harbour. So exciting.</p>
<p>The other day <a href="http://blogaholics.ca">Arieanna</a> contacted me via Twitter and asked if I wanted a photo pass for the <a href="http://www.bcfestival150.ca/event_info/index_aug2.php">festivities</a> this weekend in Victoria. Since I haven't been to Victoria in a few years, I thought it might be a good opportunity to sample some island beer and take some photos.</p>

<p>Sometimes photo passes just let you get your camera in the door, and aren't really anything special. However, Arieanna just got confirmation that our passes include access to the front-stage pit, as well as backstage and potentially interview access. I'm more of a photo kind of guy, but I'm sure Arieanna is anxious to get a few interviews for b5media.</p>
<p>Shooting the Juno awards was obviously a pretty big highlight in my photography career, but truth be told, it was a rather challenging shooting environment since everything was inside and dimly lit. I'm actually really excited to shoot an outdoor concert, since the photos always turn out awesome. Plus, I'll be able to use my sharpest lens, my $1500 70-200mm f/2.8L, which will hopefully give me some fairly awesome shots. In addition, I'd love to try a few HDR shots of the inner harbour, assuming I can figure out how to take a HDR with a beer in one hand and a camera in the other.</p>
<p>Some of the artists performing are Sarah McLachlan, Leslie Feist, Jim Byrnes, Alex Cuba, Colin James, Jessie Farrell, and more. Should be a great time. I wonder how the nachos are in Victoria?</p>
<p>I was right next to Leslie Feist at the Junos, but I never had the opportunity to talk to her. So maybe this time I'll have a chance to say hi. I'm probably heading over on Sunday, and will be back Tuesday morning in time to go to work and detoxify.</p>
