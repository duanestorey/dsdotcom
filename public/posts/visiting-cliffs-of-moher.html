                <p>One of the most impressive geological formations in the world are the Cliffs of Moher located in County Claire, Ireland. Located approximately an hour drive away from Galway, it's an easily accessible location in the beautiful Burren region of Ireland, which has an eerie resemblance to a moonscape.</p>

<p>I visited the Cliffs once in 2011, but unfortunately it was foggy and didn't make for very nice photos. Thankfully I got a chance to go back again yesterday and got to see the Cliffs of Moher with much better sunshine this time. If you're going to visit the Cliffs of Moher, I recommend giving yourself a window of a few days so you optimize your chances of having nice weather for your visit. When it is cloudy and foggy the view isn't nearly as impressive, so definitely hold out for a bit of sun if you can.</p>

<p>Near the highest point at the Cliffs of Moher is O'Brien's Tower, a castle-like structure that looks out over the water as well as the Cliffs. History is a bit conflicted about how the tower came to be, but one version says O'Brien built the tower to impress girls he was courting. You can climb to the top of the small tower for a small fee, or you can simple view the Cliffs from below and snap a few photos of the tower such as the one above.</p>

<p>We visited the Cliffs of Moher thanks to a paid tour originating from the town of Galway. We paid 20 Euros each, which included transportation to a few spots within the Burren, including a stop in Doolin, a cute little town close to the Cliffs. The tour lasted about six and a half hours, including the one hour stop we had at the Cliffs. Some tours give you more than two hours there, which is great if you want to spend time browsing around the visitor's centre there. But if you're main interest is just to explore the Cliffs of Moher, then an hour is likely enough time.</p>
<p>If you're in Ireland, definitely visit the Cliffs of Moher as they are truly impressive and well worth your time.</p>
