            <p>A long time ago I wrote that I had started to try and turn the Crossroads Flickr plugin into a full-featured stock photography plugin. Unfortunately, I haven't had much time to work on it in the last six months, but finally sat down last night to start to hack on it a bit more. I'm thankful to say that I've finally put most of the pieces together such that I now have a full featured stock photography section on my website powered almost exclusively by Flickr. If you'd like to browse around, I suggest you head over to Leslie Feist gallery and start there.</p>
<p>There is still a ton of room to improve upon things, but most of the larger pieces are now in place. The prices are set based on available Flickr sizes, and are priced according to image megapixels. I need to go through my archives and re-upload some of my older images, since in the old days I used to scale everything down before putting it on Flickr (something that doesn't really make sense when you have a pro account on Flickr). But for the most part, the sizes available are decent enough for most web purposes.</p>
<p>When someone purchases a photo, Crossroads will intercept the Paypal IPN call and do the fulfillment over email, sending a custom link to each person that represents the photo they've purchased.</p>
<p>I still have lots to do with it before it gets released to the public (and in fact, I'm not promising that it will be released to the public in any sort of timely manner, since we have a full plate at BraveNewCode in the new year), but at least on this site I'll get to continue tinkering with it over the next few months.</p>
