                <p>I can't really say that I've seen much of Victoria since being here, since I haven't really been out that much. That said, it's been really great just hanging out with some old friends and taking it easy.</p>
<p>My friend Jeff (who has been a friend of mine since high school) picked me up at the Helicopter pad in Victoria on Friday night, and we spent most of the night just chilling at his place watching movies. Today Jeff, Michele and I took Maya (their 2.5 yr old daughter) down to her gymnastics class and watched that for an hour or so. Then we came back to Jeff's house and made a pretty awesome dinner involving home made focaccia bread and pasta. Maya and Michele did most of the heavy lifting on the Apple Crisp:</p>

<p>Strangely enough, I don't really see many of my high school and university friends all that often anymore. I know without a doubt that years could pass and we'd all still be able to pick up where things left off. But there's something comforting about hanging out with people that you've known for more than half of your life, and reminiscing about events that happened 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, it's been a great weekend here, and it was awesome catching up with some old friends. Tomorrow evening I'll be on the 6pm Helicopter back to Vancouver, and eventually back to Chilliwack later in the night.</p>
