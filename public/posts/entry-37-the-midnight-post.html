                <p>Well, assuming my fingers can press the right buttons at the appropriate times, this post will end up on sliding down the tubes sometime around midnight. It's dark outside now. The reason it's dark is because it's midnight, and the sun is on the other side of the planet.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, most people are still here from this morning. Everyone is obviously a bit tired, but most people are soldiering on. I'm hoping to go to a housewarming tomorrow for a while, which means I need to find a place to hole up and get a few hours of sleep after this. Despite being tired, I'm fairly certain I'll be fine after four or five hours of sleep, so that's what I'm shooting for.</p>
<p>As I mentioned a few days ago, I have a campsite booked for most of this upcoming week. It's up at Cultus, which means I'll probably come home in the morning, shower, and do a few hours of work. But I'm hoping to unplug in the evenings, and either sit in my tent and read or possible mingle with some of the other locals. Like most summers, this one is slipping away rather quickly. So I really hope I can spent some time enjoying the outdoors before it's all over.</p>
<p>Only six more hours to go, and then all of us can hit the hay. Definitely looking forward to it.</p>
