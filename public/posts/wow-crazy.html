                <p>So, I really don't know how to describe the last few hours. It was pretty amazing.</p>
<p>The thing is, I was invited to shoot photos on the red carpet for some all inclusive event. Unfortunately, even though it was sponsored by a company and they wanted lots of publicity, as a photographer most of us weren't allowed inside. So after about 20 minutes of taking photographs in the cold, I figured I had better uses for my time, and headed down to this other party downtown (thanks to a girl we met during the night).</p>
<p>Anyways, despite not being on the guest list, we all somehow get ourselves into the hotel. For the rest of the night I hung out with Juno nominees and winners in a special section of the bar, drinking, laughing and having a great time. At one point, I ended up in guitar jam room full of people that lacked a guitarist, so I grabbed the nearest Les Paul and joined the crowd. Later Arieanna told me that I was basically rocking with all the Juno nominees or winners in a crowd of people. So, that was a fairly big highlight of my weekend. I think Arieanna too a video of it, so I'll try and post it at later. I am, at best, a mediocre guitar player, but thankfully everyone was pretty tipsy and I managed to keep up for five minutes or so.</p>
<p>I also got free shoes from Adidas. Upstairs was a room full of those people, and I went into a room where Adidas replaced my shoes with cooler items, for free. What an evening. I even have this new leather bag that says "Adidas Super Star."</p>
<p>Tonight is the awards show, so I'm going to head on over to that shortly. And the later I'm going to come back to my hotel and relax. I have an early morning flight back to Vancouver tomorrow, and then it's back to being software engineer Duane again. But that's ok -- he's a fun guy too.</p>
