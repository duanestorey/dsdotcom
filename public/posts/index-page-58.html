I've seen a few rumour sites suggest that Apple is preparing to seed developers with an early 10.6 release of their operating system. You can read about it here. If true, it sounds like it's more of a maintenance/stability release, which makes me really wonder why they would name it a 10.6 instead of a 10.5.4. And to be honest, I'd be really disappointed if they were to release 10.6 as a real, full fledged (i.e. you have to pay more money) update to the operating system, considering Leopard isn...

For whatever reason you can only take the stairwell in our building on the way down. Considering we're only on the third floor, the inability to walk up a few flights of stairs is a big pain in the ass.

Before I get into my hacking attempt, I want to give a quick review of what I think of Apple TV so far. To be honest, I really like the idea of what Apple TV is supposed to be. Unfortunately, it's not really that yet. The main problem is there really isn't enough content on it. I check ...

The URL for your blog
The name of the hosting company that you're on

That changed a few years ago when the border agents were given the ability to search your laptop for child pornography. And while I think the end goal (cracking down on pedophiles) is a good one, I have to say that I'm against the current method of blindl...

For the most part, it's been a really great car. The mileage isn't super amazing (it's not that bad either, but definitely no Prius), but it's fun to drive and it looks pretty sexy (for a hatchback). The only downside is that...
