                <p>I've been toying with this rather amazing idea for the last few years. I'm going to toss this out there, because I'm rather fond of it.</p>
<p>The Vancouver technology scene is rather impressive. Almost every week there's a really awesome event taking place that brings together some great minds. I can't tell you how much I've learned from my peers in the last few years.</p>
<p>Given that we all take time out to get together and discuss technology, I always thought it would be fun to all go somewhere all together. Sort of like a less formal SxSW, but with more of an unconference component.</p>
<p>So here's what I imagine. Sometime around November, I was thinking it would be great for everyone to hit a beach, either in Mexico or the Caribbean, and spend a week discussing technology, learning about photography, going on photo walks, and of course, drinking beer. Considering you can get a flight plus all inclusive food and drinks for around $1000, I think it's a pretty great steal for a technology gathering.</p>
<p>I'm just throwing this out there for now, but if there's enough interest, I'd love to pull this off. We could definitely get some group rates for the flights and the resort I'm sure. We could even tie in a <a href="http://wordcamp.org">WordCamp session</a> into this as well, or maybe something fun for the Drupal guys as well.</p>
<p>So, if taking a week off and hanging out with some great technology people in the sun somewhere interests you, then drop a comment. I think it would be a pile of fun, and I can't imagine a better environment to talk tech than next to an ocean, drinking beer and eating nachos.</p>
