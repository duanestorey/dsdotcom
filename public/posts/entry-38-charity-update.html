                <p>I did a quick tally of all the emails pledge I've received from Rebecca's site, and we're sitting at around the $400 $450 mark, which is great. Thanks to everyone who has pledged so far. My own personal goal was to try and hit $1000, and we're doing pretty good so far. There are only about ten entries left, so if you've been sitting on the fences waiting to potentially donate, now's your chance.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my last entry, <a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/2008/07/entry-37-signed-copy-of-matthew-goods-hospital-music/">Matthew Good has also generously donated a signed copy of his last album</a>, Hospital Music, which hit #1 in Canada when it was released last year. Anyone who donates at least $10 is eligible to potentially win it. Also, for anyone that donates $50 or more, you'll also be eligible for the signed Matthew Good CD, as well as receiving a free 8x12 photo print of your choice from <a href="http://duanestorey.smugmug.com/gallery/3418360_rtJCf#191460517_NaefR">my Vancouver HDR Gallery</a>.</p>

<p>Now's your chance to contribute to a really great charity, and make a difference in someone else's life.</p>
