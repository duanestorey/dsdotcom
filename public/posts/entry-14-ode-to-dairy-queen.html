            <p>A bunch of us are currently hanging out down in Gastown at a little place called Workspace. Because of how important Blogathon is and the amount of dedication involved by the participants, several organizations have offered to sponsor the event, namely in the area of food.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2664/3754396793_e545ca4dfe.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The first sponsor of today's event is <a href="http://www.dairyqueen.com/us-en/">Dairy Queen</a>, and they'll be supplying all of us with burgers, fries, chicken strips, sundaes, blizzards, and onion rings. Back in high school, I had a bit of a crush on a girl who worked at Dairy Queen. Given that we went to different schools, and the only chance I'd have to run into her was at Dairy Queen, I'd usually convince my friends to go for ice cream from time to time, something they grew very sick of very quickly.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to thank Dairy Queen for making it possible to see that cute girl years ago, and also for keeping all of us bloggers fueled up such that we can focus on blogging, and our respective charities. Thanks Dairy Queen.</p>
