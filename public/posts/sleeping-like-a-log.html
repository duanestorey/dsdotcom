                <p>I had a rough sleep the other night, so I was a bit tired yesterday. I passed out on the couch for a bit in the late afternoon and early evening, and woke up just long enough to grab some McDonald's for supper. Afterwards I started watching a bit of Lost, but could hardly keep my eyes open. I strolled into bed at around 9pm last night, thinking I would read for a while. Apparently I passed out, because next thing I knew it was about 4am in the morning. By the time the night was over, I had slept 11 hours, which is a pretty long sleep for me.</p>
<p>I'm just taking it easy this weekend. I have a <a href="http://www.wordcampvancouver.com">WordCamp Vancouver</a> organization meeting on the weekend, but other than that am just going to relax and maybe watch a few movies.</p>
