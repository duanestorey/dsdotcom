                <p>While I don't have any kids of my own, what I do have are a really great niece and nephew that I love very much:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/2087863008/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2397/2087863008_0b2ff89f75.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Despite not really spending much time with them over the last ten years (mostly because I lived in a different city), I'm actually fairly close to both of them, and have really been enjoying my time with them since moving back to Chilliwack. Last night my niece gave me a phone call and told me about all of the boy crushes she had while at summer camp (count 'em people, 11 boy crushes).</p>
<p>So this post is dedicated to all the kids in everyone's lives, and how special they all are. Feel free to post a link to any photos of your kids, or to drop a comment about how special the little ones are in your life.</p>
