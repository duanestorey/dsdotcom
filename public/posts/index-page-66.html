                So, I didn't start this challenge, but I gladly played along with it. I just checked, and I"m still in the #1 spot for Vancouver Blogger. The festivities tonight start at 6pm, so I'm assuming that's when Northern Voice officially starts.

I was sort of expecting someone to fly ahead at the last second, and maybe that will still happen. But unless something major changes or Google does another index, it's looking pretty good for camp Duane.
Anyone want to concede defeat at this point? :)...

                There are a lot of different ways you can increase the speed of your website, even if you have relatively cheap hosting. If you're lucky, your blogging platform already has a caching engine built in (Drupal does). If you're unlucky, and running something like Wordpress, you have to do a bit more work.
Caching makes a website more responsive because it takes an expensive operation (such as a long database query) and stores it so that next time it doesn't have to recompute it entirely. For example...

Which is strange, because the ads are fairly targeted based on a few specific, popular pages of mine.
