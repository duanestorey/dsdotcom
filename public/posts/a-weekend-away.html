            <p><a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Screen-shot-2009-10-08-at-9.17.31-PM.png"><img src="images/Screen-shot-2009-10-08-at-9.17.31-PM-300x131.png" alt="Delta Grand Okanagan" title="Delta Grand Okanagan" /></a>A few hours ago I spread my legs out on the couch hoping that my headache would go away if I rested for a few minutes. I just woke up, and realized that I had actually fallen asleep for around two hours, which I guess means I was pretty beat.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I'm heading out of town for the weekend. I've been treated to a complementary weekend in Kelowna thanks to the <a href="http://www.deltahotels.com/hotels/hotels.php?hotelId=221">Grand Delta Okanagan</a> hotel. It's a great hotel situated right on the lake, and the Delta is putting me up in one of their nicer suites for the weekend.</p>
<p>Tomorrow night I'm being treated to a really nice dinner in their new restaurant. Other than Earl's here in Chilliwack, it's been a while since I've had a nice dinner, so I'm looking forward to that. On Saturday, tourism Kelowna is also treating me to a few cool activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>St. Hubertus Harvest Lunch - The Harvest Lunch is to celebrate the start of the new harvest and showcase Okanagan food. Each lunch is designed by a local chef and matched with St. Hubertus and Oak Bay wines. The meal will be served at a beautifully set long table under a white marquee in the vineyard.</li>
<li>Cedar Creek Estate Winery Tour and Tasting</li>
<li>House of Rose Fall Grape Stomps - A good old fashioned grape squishing event! Should be some great photo opportunities here</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll probably also squeeze in a few more activities of my own, and will probably set out on a photowalk during the morning.</p>
<p>I'll be leaving Chilliwack around 1pm or 2pm tomorrow, which should put me in Kelowna with enough time to relax at the bar for an hour or so before I have to show up for dinner. Should be a great trip, and I'm looking forward to it! Big thanks to Delta resorts and tourism Kelowna.</p>
