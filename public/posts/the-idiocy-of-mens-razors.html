                <p><img src="https://duanestorey.com/assets/posts/2009/large_CarltonSafeRazorEbony.webp" alt="" />I went to the store last night to pick up a new razor for my face. Unfortunately, I have rather coarse facial hair, so the typically blade for me lasts 3 or 4 shaves, and then I have to toss it out. Given that a razor and a set of four blades costs around $12 - $14, that means I'm paying at least $1 a shave, which kind of sucks.</p>
<p>I went in last night originally to buy a set of new blades for my Mach whatever razor. Unfortunately, since blades are big money I guess, they keep those under lock and key, which means you basically have to flag down someone and get them to open it. I wasn't really in the mood, so I bought a new razor (which is basically the same price), and headed towards the door.</p>
<p>In the old days, men didn't shave using these complicated four or five blade razors, they basically just used a single or a double edge razor. My friend Ianiv has a <a href="http://www.momentumgrooming.com/Merkur-Safety-Razor">Safety Razor</a>, and he basically swears by it. Truthfully, I'm thinking of picking one up myself. Firstly, it's not made out of plastic, and that's a big plus for me. It's the kind of thing you keep for a few years, unlike a stupid Mach or Gillette razor that ends up in the garbage every few months. A package of ten blades costs around $8 in Vancouver, but considering most of them are doubled sided, I'm assuming that's really the equivalent to 20 blades. So that means each blade costs around 40 cents. If you assume I can get 3 or 4 shaved out of each blade (and I suspect I'd get more, especially since there's nothing really to clog up with hair), then that brings the cost down to like 13 cents or so per shave.</p>
<p>It's not really the cost that I'm concerned with, it's more so paying $15 for a device that gives a crappy shave. Plus, as I get older I try to be a bit more environmentally conscious, and the lack of packaging for the safety razor system and blades seems way more green.</p>
