                <p>I was just reading that Sony has finally come out with a digital SLR of their own. At first I kind of scoffed at it, thinking that nobody really uses Sony these days (seems like everywhere I go someone has a Canon or Nikon SLR). However, reading the specs, it seems pretty impressive. I like the idea of putting the image stabilization in the camera body instead of on the lens. Canon charges quite a bit for the IS versions of several of its lenses, so it's nice to know that Sony is a little smarter in this area. I'm not sure what the price point is for this new SLR, but it might be fun to check one out sometime.</p>
