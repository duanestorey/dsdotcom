                <p>My friend Stacey just sent me a message on Facebook and told me that her family just opened a new coffee shop on Denman called Dulcinea. Apparently they have really great Spanish Coffee, as well as some great chocolate drinks. Here's a <a href="http://tastyturntable.com/2008/10/06/dulcinea/">little blurb on the internet</a> about them from last month:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After my favorite chocolate cafe, Koko, closed it’s doors earlier this year - I was heartbroken. To my relief, it finally reopened on October 1st. Well, not exactly - it’s still a chocolate cafe in the same location - but the new place has different owners, a different theme, and a different name: The Dulcinea. I no longer have access to Koko’s amazing premier chocolates, but something wonderful has taken its place. This new chocolate cafe has a strong Spanish streak running through it and staff that know what they’re doing when it comes to chocolate.</p>
<p>The Dulcinea offers a variety of desserts, espressos, spanish chocolate drinks and a selection of tapas. The prices at first glance may seem a little steep - but are actually reasonable considering the excellent quality of their offerings. [...]</p>
<p>The service is quick and uber-polite. The staff is trying real hard to iron out the little unexpected problems with a new business. The kids running the place and the Spanish flair certainly cement Dulcinea’s early reputation already making them more lively than surrounding shops. Hopefully they’ll flourish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their website is <a href="http://www.dulcineachocolatecafe.com/">still a work in progress</a>, but it looks like it's coming along. If you're in the area, stop by and tell them Duane sent you!</p>
<p>Updated - I got a list of good, tasty stuff they have there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dulcinea Chocolate Cafe</li>
<li>Spanish delights</li>
<li>Desserts and Tapas</li>
<li>Spanish Chocolate and Coffees</li>
<li>Small Indulgences</li>
</ul>
<p>604 689-2699 1118 Denman St.</p>
<p>Mention Duane and receive a 1528 solo drink! I don't know what that is, but sounds good!</p>
