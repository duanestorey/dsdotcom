                <p>Day four was a pretty short day, mainly because I had to head to the airport around 3pm to get ready for my flight. I spent most of the day shopping for souveneirs. While I didn't spend too much money, I really wanted to shop somewhere on 5th avenue, just so I can say that I did. I really wasn't prepared for how much money stuff is in these stores. When I walked into Sak's on 5th Avenue, I figured I might be able to buy something for a hundred bucks or so. The first thing I passed was a table full of purses that had been marked down over 50% off. The cheapest of these was $1000 -- that's right, one thousand dollars. So anyways, I didn't get anything too crazy, but I did pick up something small, and I have the bag to prove it.</p>

<p>Once all the shopping was done, I spent one more final hour sitting in Central Park, thinking about my trip, and where I'd be going next. I met some great people in New York, and had a really amazing time with everything I did. It was sad when I walked down the subway steps and the end of the day, casting one last glance up at 5th avenue as I said goodbye to the city that never sleeps.</p>
<p>I can't wait to go back.</p>
