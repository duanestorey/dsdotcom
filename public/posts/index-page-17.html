Getting down to the wire!
Yesterday I was talking about my trip to some family members, and came to the realization that I'm only a week away from starting it. Truthfully, it's starting to sink in now, and I find myself split between feeling excited and feeling a bit nervous. Excited, because I have a great opportunity to see some of the world and make some new friends along the way. Nervous, because I hate flying and challenging traveling situations. But, I'm approaching this whole trip with a...

Basically it's an iPhone application that can translate (in real time) between Spanish and English. Obviously the grammar is a tad off since the words don't get reordered, but I can imagine a lot of really great uses for this on my trip. I'm going to grab a copy and play around with it this weekend. But definitely cool....

I figured (incorrectly) that it would be just as easy to obtain insurance for my upcoming trip, which is why I left it until the last minute. I've slowly been chipping away at the problem for the last month or so, and finally managed...

Yesterday the Canadian government alluded to a plan to completely remove the penny from circulation in the next 12 months. Their main motivation for this change is cost - the currently cost of a penny is around 1.5 cents, but the value of the coin is only 1.0 cent. So, the government would like to get rid of the penny.
Now what does that mean for the average person? To be honest, not a whole lot in my opinion.
First, retailers are supposed to round the final values to the nearest 5 cent value. ...

Ron Paul, one of the most vocal opponents of the monopoly the Federal reserve has in the United States, has just been appointed to the head of the Federal Reserve oversight committee.
