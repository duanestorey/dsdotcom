                <p>Oh man, I am a very sweaty pig. The clouds have gone away, and I've been sweating pretty much non stop. I'm about to jump in the pool and relax, but as I swung by the open wireless here I thought I'd do a quick update.</p>
<p>I made my way to the Plaza here in Playa Dorada, which is a unique collection of outdoor shops. I purchased some Cuban cigars (not sure why, but when in rome...), and just booked two excursions for the next two days.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll be spending the day drinking and sightseeing on a Safari into the heart of the Dominican Republic. It will be a good opportunity to see what the Dominican Life is like and also take in some of the local culture.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, I'll be getting on a bus and heading to "Paradise Island". We'll be drinking during this trip as well, ultimately getting on a pile of James Bond like speedboats and heading for a remote island where we'll spend three hours partying and snorking amongst some of the best reefs in the Dominican.</p>
<p>Both events should provide for some great photo opportunities. I'm thinking about doing one more on Saturday (white water rafting maybe), or perhaps I'll just spend my last full day here by the pool. I'm not sure yet.</p>
