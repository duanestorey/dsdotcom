                Yes sports fans, it's time for another update. Today is day 65 in Buenos Aires. About an hour ago I had my last hair-cut in the city, and going forward there are a bunch of "lasts" about to happen. In fact, it seems like most of the expats I've met in the city are already gone or on their way out. A guy named Emerick from Montreal left two weeks ago, and another guy from New York is leaving this weekend. I suspect many people came to experience a summer in Buenos Aires, and now that summer is tr...

                As many people know, I'll be heading to Europe right after my trip to New York City. I officially arrive in Ireland on April 6th, and will be spending the next few weeks around the United Kingdom.

Europe is expensive, there's no doubt about it. Most hotels are around $150 a night for anything decent, and many hostels get bad reviews for what they charge. Since I've been living pretty cheaply in Argentina, I'm going to live it up a bit in April.
Ireland was definitely on the schedule, as was Lon...

In North America we all know that they got themselves into a bit of a debt crisis, but the how and the way are mostly lacking from media over here.
In short, it was their own fault. Banks were participating in predatory lending, and most people in Ireland were hungry for credit. Many of this guy's friends had th...

                When I first started planning this trip, the thought of spending almost a full year in perpetual summer seemed like an amazing goal to shoot for. I mean, who wouldn't want sunshine and warm temperatures all the time?

Truthfully though, I would love nothing more than to have a serious cold snap down here in Buenos Aires. It's been around 28C or higher pretty much since I arrived. If that were a dry heat, it wouldn't be too bad. But it's very humid here, and it makes the heat seem that much worse...

SLR cameras and lenses are heavy. They are hard to carry, hard to pack, and a pain to take from place to place. But if you want high-end image quality, than a SLR offers you the best of the best. I love my SLR, but my Canon 40D SLR is in need of re...

I'm not sure why, but the internet in all of Buenos Aires seems to be on its knees. It's definitely worse in my apartment, but it's sporadic all over the city right now too.
The first two months I was here it was slow, but reliable for the most part. It would take me 10 hours to download something that would take me 1 or 2 back home, but you could always get online when you needed to. It's been getting worse over the last two weeks, and these last few days have been pretty brutal.

I went for a walk at lunch to clear my mind, and ended up strolling through a little park in Palermo. There was an empty bench that was cast in a bit of shade from a large tree, so I sat down with the intention of relaxing for a few minutes while listening to music.
About 45 degrees to my right was another guy on a bench casually reading a book, and 45 degrees to my left was another guy who was taking a little nap on his bench. Just a couple of dudes enjoying a nice sunshiny day in the park.
