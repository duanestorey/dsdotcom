                <p>A few months ago I started a small series to talk about my ongoing goal to make at least $500 a month from this website. You can read <a href="/tips/blogging/how-to-make-money-from-a-travel-blog-part-1/">How To Make Money From A Travel Blog: Part 1</a> and <a href="/tips/blogging/how-to-make-money-from-a-travel-blog-part-2/">Part 2</a> here.</p>

<h3>This Month's Results</h3>
<p>In the month of October I made $709 from this website, which is a 100% improvement over the previous month's revenue of $347. That means I not only hit my goal of making $500/month, but I passed it by over $200.</p>
<p>In terms of revenue, here's where it came from for the month of October.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/">Amazon Associates</a> - $349</p>
<p>Last month I predicted that my Amazon revenue would likely go down this month. That turned out to be incorrect, and I made almost half of my revenue from a few Amazon products. My strategy for this has been rather simple - find posts that are already popular on my website, and then link to a few helpful Amazon products where appropriate. For example I have a post talking about a popular diet I once tried. Since it was a popular post, I simply added a few links to the bottom for some books that might interest people. Now one out of every ten people or so who read that post buy that book, which is a great source of revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://mignerd.com/barclaypaidflyfree">Barclaycard Arrival</a> - $250</p>
<p>Since one of the ways I earn free travel is to leverage travel rewards cards, I've been trying for a few months to get approved to promote them on this website. Many of the applications take months to process, and unless you're a huge retailer you often get denied. But I was recently approved for one of the best American travel rewards cards, the Barclaycard Arrival. It's obviously not ideal for me, since I would prefer to discuss products that I actually use myself. But I pointed out that I don't own that card in a few places, and simply quoted what I think is good about that card. Last month two people signed up for it based on my information, which amounted to a $125 commission for each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://adsense.google.com">Google Adsense</a> - $54.30</p>
<p>Google actually climbed to the #3 spot on my website this last month, which was a nice surprise. I was considering getting rid of Google ads completely at around the $20/mo mark, but $50/mo is enough for me to leave them on. I suspect I am making more since I added a mobile ad to WPtouch Pro for Adsense, as well as a responsive sidebar for my main site for people who have large desktop screen sizes (I didn't have a sidebar last month). This allows me to keep my site content-focused for people with smaller screens, but take advantage of advertising on the sidebar for people with larger ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=c62a4d3586fc">DigitalOcean</a> - $20 actual revenue, $420 pending</p>
<p>Someone pointed out to me after last month's posts that making money off of Digital Ocean wasn't really what they had in mind for monetizing a travel website. I hadn't really thought about it, but it's a valid point. For me though, since my interests are really varied, I often review many of the products and services that I use. If they have an affiliate program, then great. But if not, I still often write and publish reviews. I try hard to only write reviews for products that I actually use myself, and currently I have approximately $50/mo worth of services at DigitalOcean.</p>
<p>I was a bit concerned when looking at these numbers that many of the sign-ups at DigitalOcean haven't converted at all. Thankfully I woke up this morning (November 1st) and saw that $70 worth had actually converted into revenue overnight, so I am hopeful that more of these sign-ups will eventually start paying out. Since DigitalOcean pays out once a customer spends $10, and their cheapest often is $5/mo, for many people it will take at least 2 months for the commission to be earned, which is what I am seeing. I suspect many won't convert though, since some people probably just signed up to check it out. But we'll see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://strongvpn.com">StrongVPN</a> - $16</p>
<p>I did a post over a year ago about how to use a VPN provider, like StrongVPN, to watch Netflex in other countries. I think I made three small commissions via StrongVPN this last month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://cj.com">Commission Junction</a> - $8.26</p>
<p>Since I now have a sidebar again, I added a few of my old Commission Junction ads back to my site. While the amount I earned this month seems pretty poor, I actually helped sell about $3,000 worth of hotel bookings via Commission Junction last month. Unfortunately I only get paid when people actually complete their stays, and so far none of them have yet. Assuming all of those bookings ultimately turn into commissions, there's another $150 or so that I'll receive, most likely during this next month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.worldnomads.com/af.aspx?affiliate=mignerd&amp;subid=&amp;utm_source=mignerd&amp;utm_medium=textlink&amp;utm_campaign=easy_url">World Nomads</a> - $0</p>
<p>I usually make between $50 and $100 a month of travel insurance that people buy through my website, but last month I didn't make any which is unusual. I sent roughly the same amount of traffic to World Nomads, but people didn't end up purchasing. I suspect this is just an anomaly, but we'll see next month.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Popular Markers</h3>
<p>I’ve been tracking a few statistics on the web over the past three month’s to see just how well my website is doing compared to others.</p>
<p>My Alexa rating at the end of last month was 563,000, and today it is 312,548, which is a great improvement. In terms of my US ranking, I'm sitting at 156,000. Once you break 100,000 for the US, Alexa starts treating you different and actively monitoring your statistics.</p>
<p>I also track SitePrice.org to see what it thinks my website is worth, even though I know the number doesn't mean all that much. SitePrice.org said my website was worth $16,560 at the end of last month, and today it says it is worth $21,215. That number essentially estimates your site worth based on traffic and how much money someone can make by monetizing your website. So if somewhere were to pay $21,000 for this website, and it was making $700/month, they would make their original investment back in a little over two years.</p>
<p>In terms of eBook sign-ups for my free travel guide, <a href="http://mignerd.com/book">Beginner's Guide to Long-Term Travel and Lifestyle Design</a>, I average around 2 or 3 a day, which I'm definitely happy with. If I can establish an ongoing relationship with 1,000 people who are interested in travelling over the course of a year, I think that will be great.</p>
<h3>Time For A New Goal</h3>
<p>I chose $500/mo for my original goal for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, I spend roughly $6,000 a year on airline tickets. At $500/mo, I basically offset all of that, which means I can basically travel for free.</p>
<p>And second, at around $500/mo I think it is easy to say that this website is a legitimate business, albeit a small one. What that means is that I should be able to write-off most of my travel related expenses going forward.</p>
<p>I also thought that if I ever stop travelling for a period of time (which I'm going to do for three months to save some money in February) that I could simply divert my website income into my retirement portfolio. Most financial advisors would be pretty happy if they could convince clients to shove away $500/mo towards retirement each month. If I could basically just keep writing on this website every few days and have that essentially fund my retirement, it means I can use my other income for enjoying life and seeing things in the world that interest me.</p>
<p>I'm going to set a new goal of $1,000 month, just to see if I can hit it. I actually woke up this morning to see that I had made almost $200 overnight thanks to a new Barclaycard sign-up, as well as $70 worth of DigitalOcean sign-ups finally converting. So that means I only need to make another $800 in the next 29 days.</p>
