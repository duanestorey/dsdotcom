                <p>First, I gotta say, I'm all over this little pub at Cultus Lake. I first came up here with Rebecca and John on the weekend, but it not only has one of the nicest patios I've been on in a while, but a pretty decent selection of food and drinks as well. I'm fairly certain they're all gonna know me by name here pretty soon.</p>
<p>This weekend I'm meeting my friend Lynn down in Anacortes, WA, and we're going to take the little ferry over to <a href="http://www.fridayharbor.com/">Friday Harbor</a> for the day. I actually was there a very long time ago (it was a field trip back in high school for some of us), and I remember it being fairly cool, especially the ferry ride. So I'm definitely looking forward to heading back and seeing it again, some 14 years later.</p>

<p>My only hope for the trip (other than catching up with a friend) is to hopefully find a little hole in the wall establishment that serves fresh fish and chips. Other than that, I'll be packing my camera around, and hoping to take a few shots near the ocean. Should be fun.</p>
