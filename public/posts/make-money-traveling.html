                <p>I wrote a post recently about <a href="/2011/current-2011-travel-metrics/">my travel metrics from the last six months</a>. One of the observations I made was that I had spent roughly $500 a month on average for airfare. Given that I gave my apartment up in British Columbia prior to leaving, airfare is one of my only extra expenses I have when I travel. Taken together with a $90 a month storage locker and roughly $50 a month in travel insurance, that's a rough cost of $650 a month that is in excess of what I would normally spend back in North America. If you do the math, a person will realize that they can actually make money traveling the world, at least when compared to the typical expenses they would spend back home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/1294298473_8b248954a3_z.jpg"><img src="../assets/posts/2011/1294298473_8b248954a3_z-350x222.webp" alt="" title="Beach" /></a></p>
<p>But I also made the observation that it cost nearly $450 a month to keep my car on the road here in Canada. That breaks down to roughly $250 a month in gas, $150 in insurance, and about $50 in routine maintenance (oil changes, tire replacements, etc). I wasn't big on cable TV back home, but people who give up their apartment and other expenses such as cable will likely be able to add another $100 or $200 to this disposable income as well when traveling.</p>
<p>If you take both of my numbers together, the $650 I spend each month traveling and the $450 I save by parking my car for a while, you'll come to the semi-accurate conclusion that I'm basically paying $200 extra a month to travel to exotic countries around the world instead of sitting at home.</p>
<p>By itself, that's an uplifting observation. For the price of around $7 a day, many people could temporarily give up their lives at home and travel to exotic locations, pristine beaches, and experience some amazing cultures around the world.</p>
<p>But the story doesn't stop there: many beautiful places in the world are in fact much cheaper to live in than North America. For example, <a href="http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Canada&amp;city1=Vancouver&amp;country2=Thailand&amp;city2=Bangkok">Bangkok, Thailand is approximately 50% as expensive as Vancouver, Canada</a>. That means the $2,000 a month I spend on routine expenses in the Vancouver area translates into more like $1,000 a month in Bangkok, which is a savings of $1,000 a month.</p>
<p>If you add it all up, I'm effectively getting paid an extra $800 a month to live on a beach in Thailand for the next few months. Not a bad way to spend the fall if you ask me.</p>
<p>So if you're one of those people that loves to travel and has the luxury of working remotely, then you may want to consider a multi-month journey to an exotic country such as Thailand or Argentina. Not only are there life changing experiences to be had, but you're likely to save a pile of money in the process as well.</p>
