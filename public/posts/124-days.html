                <p>I just wrote four post-dated rent cheques, one for each month until the new year. After that, I should be officially homeless, at least for a while. I have to give notice on my apartment on October 30th, which would put me out of my place on December 31st. Right now the plan is to take off on the 2nd of January or so, which means I can hang out around here for Christmas and New Years, and then hit the open skies.</p>
<p>I haven't had much time to study spanish yet, but I'm going to start blocking the time out in my calendar each week so I'm done all my lessons before I take off. I did one lesson a few weeks ago, but since I haven't gotten back to it in a while, I imagine I'm going to have start all over.</p>
<p>Right now the plan is to start in Buenos Aires. Depending on how things go there, I might head somewhere else afterwards. In terms of cities and countries where I know a few people, here's a short list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caracas, Venezuela</li>
<li>Lyon, France</li>
<li>Novi Sad, Serbia</li>
<li>Chicago, USA</li>
<li>Limerick, Ireland</li>
<li>London, England</li>
<li>Auckland, New Zealand</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if I were to go anywhere afterwards, I would probably start with one of those.</p>
