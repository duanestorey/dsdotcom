                <p>On Friday morning I'll be flying out to the Juno awards in Calgary. There's a press conference at noon sharp where the media will get to view the entire setup as well as talk to Russell Peters, the host of the Juno Awards. I was originally going to fly out around noon, but I just got the email about the press conference so I might take the full day off and fly out at 7am, assuming I can change my flight.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting on a few image assets from the Juno organization, but I've started putting together a page that I'll use when I'm out there. If you can, please throw some link love at my <a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/2008-juno-awards/">2008 Canadian Juno Awards Coverage</a> page so that people can find it, and I don't feel like an idiot writing entirely for myself.</p>
<p>I'll probably promote it to the front page (something I've never done in Wordpress before, although the option exists) during the event, but I'm hoping to flesh out my page with a few cool surprises before I get on the plane.</p>
<p>I'll also be doing the odd post over at <a href="http://urbanvancouver.com">Urban Vancouver</a>, and probably a guest post over at <a href="http://miss604.com">Miss604.com</a>. <a href="http://johnbollwitt.com">John Bollwitt</a> is also going to lend me his iPod podcasting setup, so hopefully there will be an interview or two, should the opportunity arise.</p>
