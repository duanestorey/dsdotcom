                <p>I'm currently sitting in the Starbucks near my place, slowly hacking together what will eventually be my slideshow for WordCamp Portland. Truthfully, I'm a bit nervous about this presentation. While I've spoken at a few conferences here and there, most of my presentations were around the 20 - 30 minute mark. This time around, I have a full hour slot to fill, and crafting an hour-long presentation that doesn't completely suck is a rather delicate procedure. I'll be talking mostly about mobile blogging, both from a content producer and a content consumer perspective.</p>
<p>The good news is that apparently there's a big ice-cream pig out immediately preceding my presentation. I'm hoping that means everyone will be super happy and in a state of pure bliss.</p>
<p>I'll be driving down to Bellingham next Friday, and hoping on a plane. I have a slight lay-over in Seattle, finally reaching Portland just in time for the speakers and sponsors dinner on Friday night. WordCamp Portland is a two day event, so there will be a lot of great WordPress information being presented. I'm scheduled to fly back late Sunday night, and will probably be back in my bed sometime around 1am or so that night.</p>
<p>I'll post my slides over on BraveNewCode and here after the presentation. Until then, I have a lot of work and research still left to do.</p>
