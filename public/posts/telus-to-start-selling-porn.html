                <p>That's right. Telus, one of Canada's largest phone companies, <a href="http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=9c00061e-4aec-4410-9dc5-4d69a8274215&amp;k=60979">has decided that in order to generate more money, they are going to start selling porn to mobile customers</a>. Here's a great quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A huge amount of that is adult programming, and we don't seem to have concerns about our ability to block children from accessing that," he said. "Frankly, their mobile screen is probably more private than aTV or computer screen. They can keep it in their pocket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A mobile screen is more private that a TV or computer screen? Is he joking? Think of all the places you have your cell phone with you every day. Think of every place you are when you have a call. And think of your computer screen or TV at home. I realize that if you want porn, it already exists out there in plenty, but I'm really not so sure one of Canada's flagship telephone companies should be endorsing it on a mobile device. I can already picture guys on the skytrain downloading and surfing porn while travelling to their next stop. All it's gonna take is some kid and his parents to get be subjected to this in public before a huge lawsuit is filed.</p>
<p>Has the phone company really sunk that low?</p>
