                <p>I actually hit the sack before midnight last night, which is pretty much an unprecedented event in my life. The main reason was because I had to get up early and take my car into the shop to get some TLC.</p>
<p>While on my road trip a few weeks ago, a few things suddenly stopped working, including the door lock switch on the driver's side door, the CD player (it currently does a better job grinding CDs then it does playing them), and a small problem with my gear shifter. In addition, my car is about one year past the date I should have had a one year tune-up.</p>
<p>In terms of the last item, it's a weird situation with my car. I have an extended warranty, which basically has provisions that I have to take care of my care if they are going to honor the warranty. The problem is that I rarely drive it, and so it seemed sort of silly to have a full one-year tune-up when there was only 6,000 kms on it. I have been fairly religious with changing the oil and doing tire rotations, but this will be the first major tune-up my car has received. It's not cheap - $240, but since it's done at Mazda it will all be in the computer should I ever need to make a claim for the extended part. In terms of the other smaller items, I was told they should all be under warranty, so that's good.</p>
<p>On the way to the Mazda dealership, I actually briefly passed my friend Matt who was walking his dogs and showing off his new hat. Since the CD player was dead in my car, I was forced to listen to the radio, which has, since the last time I listened to it, seriously gone down-hill. First, there are hardly any real stations left in Vancouver it would appear. And second, most of them are completely flooded with advertising. I briefly did a stint with a satellite radio last year, and actually really liked it, but couldn't justify to the money given that I rarely drive.</p>
<p>But seriously, I don't know how people can handle normal radio anymore. I suspect mainstream radio is on it's way out, probably to be replaced by another flux of smaller stations that actually, you know, spin records again.</p>
<p>One song that actually did play was "If I Had A Million Dollars", by the Barenaked Ladies. The funny thing is that while listening to the song I actually sort of thought that a million dollars wasn't really enough these days. Condos in this city are pushing the $500,000 price, and once your million dollars has been taxed, you'll barely have enough to buy a condo. After that, you'll still be working the rest of your life. No, I think that song needs a refresh, something on the order of "If I Had A Million iPhones", or "If I Had A Couple Tanks Of Gas".</p>
<p>Anyways, that's it for my Monday update. Time to get to work.</p>
