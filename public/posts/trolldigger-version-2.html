                <p><img src="images/rss-icon.jpg" alt="" />About six months ago I got it into my head that I wanted to play around with RSS technology and see if I could come up with something cool with it. That eventually turned into a standalone RSS reader I wrote for the Mac called <a href="http://www.trolldigger.com">TrollDigger</a>. The one feature everyone liked is the ability to view the actual pages instead of the RSS excerpts. I haven't touched it since then, and the version that's currently available for download is a bit clunky, but I was thinking about spending a few hours on it this weekend.</p>
<p>To be honest, lately I've been thinking about a completely GUI-less RSS reader. I'd like to be able to subscribe to feeds, and simply get Growl notifications when new articles are available. There can be a little drop down in the status bar at the top of the screen that I can click to view new articles if I happen to miss them. Clicking on a Growl balloon would simply spawn Safari with the permalink.</p>
<p>It's less feature-rich than what TrollDigger currently is, but for some reason I find the simplistic concept sort of appealing. What does everyone else think?</p>
