A few days ago, I mentioned that Kate's fiance was going to give me a second opinion about my injury. The official word back was that yes, I do have a orbital floor fracture in addition to a tripod fracture. I sent his opinion to my plastic surgeon, and he eventually agreed that I do have one and that it should also be fixed. Which raises sort of an interesting question -- how did the two or three doctors that looked at me initially not see this?
I managed to get a hold of the plastic surgeon I...

I have a lot of sinus pressure on the left side of my face

Seriously, those guys can turn any small problem into a huge one that can cost lots of money. I was originally told the shutter door was broken, which seemed somewhat reasonable (I pictured a really small, weak hinge breaking).

                For those of you who live in Vancouver, by now you've heard that there's currently a water ban in effect for certain regions of the GVRD. You can read about this a bit more on Clay's Blog. The actual reason why the water is "bad" is apparently because of turbidity. What this basically means is that there is a lot of sediment in the water, and for some people, this can cause some problems in the toilet department.
What's a bit strange in all this is that there are lots of places in the world wher...

Afterwards, some of us met down at the Nelson St. Cafe. to see some live music. I originally went to see Melanie Dekker, but unfortunately, she played before we got there. However, the music was still pretty good, and I took some photos.

November 4th, was hospitalized, and have been slowly recovering since. It's pretty sad that there are people out there who would do something like that. It seems there's violence everywhere lately.

What's sort of interesting is that they had an ultrasound done to find out the baby's sex, and were told it was going to be a boy. So, they got lots of boys clothes, painted the room blue, picked out names, etc. But, at the hospital, they were treated to a baby girl.
I popped by for a while today to see their currently unnamed baby girl. What a cutie.

Also, the double vision at the extremities needs to clear up on its own. If it doesn't I need to go back in a few months and go see an eye specialist.
Now the good news -- although my cheekbone *has moved*, it's only moved about 1mm or so (inwards I believe). So, they gave me the option of having surgery (which amounts to having thre...
