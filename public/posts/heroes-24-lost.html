                <p>Now that I have cable again, I've been watching a bit more TV. Except for last night's Heroes and 24, I've been keeping up with all three shows.</p>
<p><img src="https://duanestorey.com/assets/posts/2009/lost.jpg" alt="Lost"></p>
<p>Of them all, Lost is the only one that's really keeping me interested. I think the whole concept of 24 has just gone on too long now. I thought season two was pretty awesome, mainly because it focused on character development. Now it's more of an action flick. They had a good opportunity with that cute FBI agent, but they really haven't used her to her full potential yet.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why, but I find Heroes pretty boring these days. I guess because everyone and their dog has some super power now, it's really hard to get worked up when anyone is in danger. I kind of miss the old days when Peter and Sylar were going at it more.</p>
<p>What do you guys think of this year's season of those shows?</p>
