            <p>One of the last conversations I had at Northern Voice was with <a href="http://www.michaelklassen.com/">Michael Klassen</a>, and it was about how Microsoft had completely forgotten about the end-user. Sure, maybe they spent five years working hard to make a new OS that they hoped everyone would like, but the user-experience just isn't there. Which is really the prime area where Apple excels -- they listen to the end user, and make the experience simple and productive. Other companies simply want to focus on the "how" and not the "why". Having a really elegantly coded application with a crappy user interface is just a waste of time. To have a successful software project you really need to listen to the end user.</p>
<p>Which makes what happened a few minutes ago all the cooler. I was sitting on my couch listening to music when suddenly I got an SMS message on my phone asking me to log into Yahoo. A few minutes later I was talking to <a href="http://josephprimiani.com/">Joey</a>, giving some guidance on how to get my plugin working for him with Wordpress. Turns out it was a simple typo on his end, brought about undoubtedly by some crappy documentation on my end, but it was rather easy to get working for him.</p>
<p>And right away, he's another happy customer, thankful that he can replace all the flash on his website with the features of Crossroads. I even asked him for some suggestions, which he gave me. Sometime this week I'll release version 1.1 which should offer a few more cool features and bring me one step closer to integrating with a few other things such as YouTube.</p>
