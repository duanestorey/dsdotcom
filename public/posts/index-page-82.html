                Last week, John got a hold of me on iChat and let me know about a Wordpress plugin competition. Since I have written a few of them, I thought I might as well enter the Crossroads Flickr plugin into the competition.
While the contest winners haven't been announced yet, they have announced all the participants over at one of the sites. If you are a user of the plugin, head on over and give it an honest rating....

                I haven't written a blog entry in a few days because quite frankly, I've been absolutely swamped at work. I've been working on a big project for a few months, and we're hoping to be done a piece of it tomorrow. I have an IM conference going between a guy in Europe, and another guy out here, and we're all putting the final pieces together.
I'm officially dead tired. After I'm done with work tomorrow, I think I'm going to come back home and take a well-deserved nap to try and recharge after today....

                In less than four weeks, I'll be getting on a plane and heading to Ottawa for my friend Rob's wedding. The last time off I took was basically back in February, and I spent that walking around rainy Seattle for only a few days. This trip, however, promises to be a lot more interesting, and hopefully more relaxing. The only real things that I have on my plate are my friend's wedding, a trip down to Toronto to see a few people, and then a visit to Quebec City (since I never spent any time there whe...

                Part of the reason I wrote the last article on insulin resistance is so I could continue to talk about that subject without continually explaining what it is I was talking about.
Sometime around the year 2003, there was a pretty seminal study performed that had an undesirable, although extremely fascinating outcome. The researchers at the time were trying to guage the body's insulin response to various foods. When they came to apple pie though, they were in for a surprise:

                I've really been trying hard to get a new release of Crossroads out for quite some time, but with my job at work, it's just so hard to find a few hours to spare these days. That being said, I've up-reved the plugin to version 2.0, and am making the changes I've done available as a download. This is an early alpha, and for sure it has a few bugs, so please don't expect it to be perfect.
Compared to version 1.0, here are some changes:

I plan to submit an entry or two during the day to help her out, so please drop by and give her some moral support! Thanks!...

                As everyone who hits my blog these days knows, I really like taking photos. My passion for photography started about seven years ago, and is still going strong today. I've been fortunate enough to be able to afford a really nice camera and a full suite of lenses, and while I sort of understand what's needed to take "good" photos, my camera really does the majority of the heavy lifting.
My friends routinely use my photos in blog posts (which I really appreciate), but every once and a while I do a...

I wasn't up to my typical drinking self, but I still managed to demolish 6 or 7 beers in fairly short order. I didn't really eat any type of supper, so I'm a bit hungry now. On Friday some of us are going to meet up after work for a longer version of tonight,...
