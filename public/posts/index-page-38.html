                Well, as you can see, I've started making changes to this website. They are far from done, but I think I've made enough headway to put it back up for a while. Here's what I have done so far:

Made a new theme, borrowing a few elements from the "default" wordpress theme
Added a custom flickr plugin that has read/write access to my flickr account
Added the ability to associate abritrary images or sets from flickr with any blog entry. These images can be viewed using the ImageBox javascript library...

However, I'm going to make some pretty major changes to it soon. Which means, I'm probably gonna take the site down for a while, probably starting this weekend. I have some pretty big ideas about what I want to do, and I'm not even sure I have the skill set to do them all. S...

Technically, Blue-Ray is superior technology, but HD-DVD is easier to manufacture, and is cheaper to produce.

All you need to do is generate a simple text file that outlines the state transitions, and their "dot" program will output the state machine diagram for you. Pretty nifty.
Here's a simple example I did:

                A new study says people who have full-fat milk gain *less* weight over time. I hate to say I told you so, but I'm not a big believer in the whole "fat makes you fat" belief. I agree saturated fat isn't very good for you, but the other types of fat are. As long as you don't eat the grissle in a steak, over 2/3 of the fat in it is good fat, which is better than most other things. Which gives me an idea for another blog entry later tonight.
