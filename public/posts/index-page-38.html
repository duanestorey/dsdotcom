                    I moved into a new apartment in January, and for the first time in ages, had a decent sized patio. Since my patio faces south (and subsequently, receives a lot of afternoon soon), I figured I would try growing a few different vegetables. When I started, I had just a few planters, and it looked something like this:

When things started sprouting, I got excited and decided to plant a few more things. Here's a shot a few weeks after I started:

I haven't taken any photos of it in a while, but here's a shot I took a few weeks ago.

Since that time, a lot of tomatoes have formed on my tomato plants, ...

                    I posted a photo of a cruise ship this morning surrounded by the mountains:

I was just reading the news though, and apparently that very same ship ended up killing a baby whale:

What appears to be a baby minke or fin whale has been impaled and killed on a cruise ship that docked in Vancouver Saturday morning.
The whale, about 20 metres long, was wrapped around the bow of the ship in full view of tourists at Canada Place.
A worker from the cruise ship, who didn’t want to be named, said he was not sure when the whale had been hit. The boat — the Sapphire Princess — had come in from Alaska ...

Things definitely seem a bit less active around here right now, probably because everyone's stomachs are all full of food now. I wouldn't be surprised though if people are losing a bit of stream -- we've all been at this nearly 8 hours already, and still have 16 hours to go. If my brain were a car engine right now, it would probably be firing on only one cylinder. I've been having a hard time constructing complete sentences in blog ...

                    I was one of the first people in Vancouver to experiment with HDR (high dynamic range) photography a few years ago. I definitely wasn't *the* first, because I actually got a bit of inspiration from a few other photographers in Vancouver who had been dabbling with HDR.
For yucks, I thought I would include the very first HDR shot I ever put together. It's a shot of Vancouver on a really storm day. I shot it from my balcony using a tripod, and merged three photos together using a tool on the Mac called Photomatix. Here's the end result:

Shaw has been offering residents in buildings wired for Novus wildly aggressive rates that it’s not offering anyone else. This appears to be an attempt to eliminate Novus, its only local cable TV competition, which is unethical and unfair.
One of these offers is selling their Shaw Digital TV with:

                    This entry represents post 18 out of a total of 49. So, I still have a fairly long ways to go. To be honest, I was pretty beat when I woke up, and feeling pretty worn out around 9:30am or so, but thankfully I seem to have gotten another wind. I've been consuming diet pop like it's going out of style, so that might have something to do with it. Or perhaps, it could be the big bottle of water I also started drinking in an effort to rehydrate myself. Whatever it is that's keeping me going, I sure hope it lasts for a while.

                    Without a doubt, one of my favorite events to shoot is a sunset. I used to live a stone's throw away from the Pacific Ocean, and walking down and watching the sun set was pretty much a weekly or a semi-weekly event during the summers. I know that many photographers think that sunset photos are a bit cliche, but I've never thought so. To me, watching the sun set highlights some of the real beauty of this world, and reminds me of all the great things that bring me joy in it.
So, here are a few of my favorite sunset photos that I've taken over the years:

                    A lot of my fellow bloggers around here have installed WordTwit today so that they can have their WordPress posts automatically show up on their Twitter feeds. While WordTwit doesn't officially support hashtags yet (those crazy things that look like #someword on Twitter), there's a quick little work around for events such as Blogathon.
First, navigate to the WordTwit administration panel. Typically you'll see something like this under general options:

The trick is to edit that text such that the hashtag you'd like to be added is automatically inserted after each post. So for the case of Blogathon, ...

The first sponsor of today's event is Dairy Queen, and they'll be supplying all of us with burgers, fries, chicken strips, sundaes, blizzards, and onion rings.

This year is really the first year where I've noticed any grey hairs, and is also the first year where I'm starting to recognize the odd pain. One in particular, a sharp pain in the heel on my left foot, tends to cause me some grief. Years ago I jumped off a big wall and landed pretty hard on my feet. I never got it looked at, but I'm fairly certain I cracked my heel bone, since I basically had to limp for around four weeks. Unfortunately, I now wake up with a sharp pain in the same area, one ...

I was recently down there in June for a big WordPress conference, and will probably be down there again in a few months I imagine. Here's a shot I took of San Francisco about a year ago from just north of the Golden Gate Bridge.

I also just picked up a few diet cokes. Which means that today so far I've had three coffees, and one 500ml diet coke. Here's a shot of the current carnage:

                    When Apple introduced the iPhone 3GS, they added a new piece of hardware: a magnetometer. That little do-dad can pick up magnetic field lines, and basically act as a virtual compass.
While kind of a neat feature, I don't think it's very practical. I mean, pretty much every iPhone 3G user I know has the data plan, which basically means they can access Google Maps whenever they want. Yes, you can't get a real time indication of your direction using Google maps, but if you move around you can obviously watch what happens and see which direction you are facing. But to be honest, it's pretty rare I ...

                    A few months ago, another event occurred that was intended to help raise money for the BC Children's Hospital Foundation. That event was the Chip's Not Dead Yet memorial mile. Here's a little quote from the BC Children's Hospital Foundation as shown on the Chip's Not Dead Yet site:

The Chip’s Not Dead Yet Memorial Mile supports BC Children’s Hospital and the uphill battles faced by children who are trying to get well, and the medical staff who are trying to make miracles happen.
Children are precious and the most vulnerable members of our society. They rely on us to care for them.

                    A bunch of us are currently down at Workspace in Vancouver, which is a shared office space situated right on the water in Gastown. I have a rather great view of the North Shore mountains along with the cruise ship terminal at Canada Place.
One of my favorite photos is this next one from Gastown I took last year from the lookout at Harbour Center:

I actually shot the photograph through a window, so it's surprising that you can't see any glass. But I've always liked all the angled lines in the photo, and of course the film-noir type lighting. If you're ever in Vancouver, make sure you head on up ...

I'm currently on my third coffee. I woke up and had a 7-11 coffee (because that's all I could find at 5:30am), then pounded back some coffee here at Workspace, and just picked up a new coffee from a little Gastown coffee shop called Lunas. I imagine I'll probably average a coffee every two hours or so, which would put me somewhere in the neighborhood of about 600 - 1200 mg of ...

Despite not really spending much time with them over the last ten years (mostly because I lived in a different city), I'm actually fairly close to both of them, and have really been enjoying my time with them since moving back to Chilliwack. Last night my niece gave me a phone call and told me about all of the boy crushes she had while at summer camp (count 'em people, 11 boy crushes).
So this post is dedicated to all the kids in everyone's lives, and how special they all are. Feel ...

                    One of the hobbies I have that brings me a lot of enjoyment is photography. It's something I've slowly honed and improved over the years to the point where I'm fairly comfortable with my camera, and with taking photos in most situations. Given how much enjoyment it's been to me, I thought I would periodically do the odd photo-entry for blogathon and talk a bit about the photos I share.

This shot of Kitsilano beach is one of the shots I'm most known for. It's currently used on the Kitsilano.ca website, and also in a few brochures. I was actually just randomly driving back from UBC one night, heading ...

                    Since I wrote in detail about Vancouver in my last post, it's only fitting that I talk a little bit about my current place of residence, Chilliwack. Chilliwack is a little farming community nestled between a mountain range, approximately 100 kms east of Vancouver. My apartment is probably only about 5 minutes from one of the nicest provincial parks in the province, complete with it's own picturesque lake:

I currently rent a 1200 square foot apartment for about $100 less a month than I was paying in Vancouver for my 700 square foot apartment. A new grocery store opened about two blocks away from ...

                    Vancouver is without a doubt one of the prettiest cities in the world, something that I appreciate more and more every time I go on a trip. In fact, I was just mentioning to a friend yesterday just how clean and inviting Vancouver is compared to most cities, specifically San Francisco and Los Angeles (both of which seem grubby and dirty by comparison, even though I happen to like aspects of both).

And while Vancouver is a pretty city, it is not without its problems. In fact, Vancouver's lower-east side is one of the poorest neighbourhoods in all of Canada, which is ironic given that it's about ...
