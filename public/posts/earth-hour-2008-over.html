                <p>I spent most of the last hour on the couch, just thinking by candlelight. It was a nice break from the norm, having a dark apartment sans the sound of computer fans spinning or other randomness that goes beep in the night.</p>
<p>Looking out my window, it's hard to tell just how many people participated. It seems slightly darker than normal I guess, but for the most part it looks like business as usual in this city.</p>
<p>For those of you who missed it, I took my site down for a few hours in support of the event. Here's a snapshot <a href="http://miss604.com">Rebecca</a> took:</p>

<p>And lastly, I just want to mention that Wordpress 2.5 was just released, so if you're looking for an upgrade, now's a good time (and in fact, many of you are running less than 2.3.3, which is a very bad idea since those versions are totally hackable). There are major UI changes in the dashboard, some of which will involve a bit of relearning. But I've been watching the wp-testers group, and those guys have been working hard to bring you something great.</p>
