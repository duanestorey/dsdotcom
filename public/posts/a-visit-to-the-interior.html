                <p><img src="images/12783_b1.jpg" alt="" />A while ago I was contacted by a PR company and asked if I wanted to enjoy an all inclusive weekend out in the Okanagan. I was fairly busy at the time, so wasn't able to take advantage of the offer then. But given how my schedule is lightening up, now seems like a good time to have a relaxing weekend. So this upcoming weekend I'll be heading to Kelowna for a weekend of Duane R &amp; R.</p>
<p>I'll be staying in the Delta Grand Okanagan hotel, which has a nice view of Lake Okanagan. I believe there's a wine festival going on throughout the weekend, so I imagine I'll class myself up a bit and pretend like I'm way cooler than I am for a night or two. I haven't been to Kelowna in a few years, so it should be a really great time.</p>
<p>Other than a weekend of camping down in Oregon in the summer, I haven't really been anywhere since last March, so I'm looking forward to escaping for a weekend. Tourism Kelowna is also trying to put together a few activities for me, so hopefully I'll have a few things to do out there as well during the days. If not, I'm more than content to walk around Kelowna with my camera and take photos for an afternoon.</p>
<p>So Friday afternoon I'll probably shut things down a bit early and head on a nice drive out towards Kelowna. I've been told there's already snow up on the Coquihala Highway, so I'll pack my chains in my car and make sure I make it to Kelowna while there's still light out. But, I'm definitely looking forward to it.</p>
