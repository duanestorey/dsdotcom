                <p>The first order of business with my new iPhone is picking up a decent case to keep it from being scratched. I called around town, but unfortunately nobody has any stock for the 3G iPhone cases yet. So basically the only place left to buy one from was on Apple's store.</p>
<p>I originally went over with the intent to buy one case. However, it appears that one case wasn't enough to qualify me for free shipping. Since I like free stuff, I decided to buy a few more things. Since I wasn't sure if I'd like the first case, I bought a second one with a different style. Worst case, I'm sure somebody will probably take it off my hands in the near future. In addition, I tacked on a new iPhone 3G dock for my stereo so I can listen to music.</p>
<p>The case I plan to use is called the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/TS458VC/A?n=iphone2&amp;fnode=home/shop_iphone/iphone_accessories/cases&amp;mco=MTMwMDAzNA&amp;s=topSellers">iPhone 3G Agent 18 EcoShield</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://a248.e.akamai.net/7/248/2041/1441/as-images.apple.com/is/image/AppleInc/TS458_AV2?wid=326&amp;hei=326&amp;fmt=jpeg&amp;qlt=95&amp;op_sharpen=1&amp;resMode=bicub&amp;op_usm=0.5,0.5,0,0&amp;iccEmbed=0" alt="iPhone 3G Eco-Shield" /></p>
<p>Here's the blurb about it from the website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EcoShield is made of a hard-plastic derived from recycled plastic bottles, even the package is made of recycled paper and easily recyclable plastic. And though the EcoShield is one of the thinnest cases around, it offers protection second to none. With interior pads to protect the iPhone 3G, this case is the perfect choice for life on the go. It also includes an Agent 18 dock adapter, so you can dock your iPhone in any Universal Docking device without taking it out of the case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the case looks cool, I was more impressed with the environmental considerations of the product.</p>
<p>The second is the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/TS476VC/A?n=iphone2&amp;fnode=home/shop_iphone/iphone_accessories/cases&amp;mco=MTI5MzUwNw&amp;p=1&amp;s=topSellers">Griffin Wave Case</a> for the iPhone 3G. For this one, I picked white since I thought it would be a cool contrast against the black:</p>

<p>They probably won't arrive for a few weeks, but I'm fairly certain I can hold out until then. Raul talked a bit more about the EcoShield <a href="http://hummingbird604.com/2008/07/14/eco-shield-for-the-iphone/">in his latest post</a>, so go check it out.</p>
<p>If you picked up an iPhone 3G and either have a case, or plan to get one, drop a comment here and let everyone know what you're looking at.</p>
