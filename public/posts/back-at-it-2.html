                <p>2007 is officially in the past now, and today was basically the start of a whole new year, at least in terms of my routine again. I spent the day at work today getting back into the groove again. Tomorrow I will most likely dive head-first into a fairly large new project, which should be pretty exciting.</p>
<p>I still have some unpacking to do from my trip, and will most likely take the tree and decorations down this coming weekend. At that point, the holidays will be completely behind me. I think tomorrow Dustin and I are going to get together and hang out for a bit, and this weekend there will probably be a small movie marathon at my place with some friends. I'm also going planning to take a break from the bar scene for a while, and will spend the next few weeks just hanging out with friends, and hopefully shooting a pile of new photos.</p>
<p>I've attended a few of the photowalks that have happened in the Vancouver community in the past year, and I think I'm going to try to organize one out my way, since I don't think there's been one in a while near the beach. I'll send out a facebook event request when the time comes, but if you're interested let me know here and I'll make sure I add you to the list. Also, maybe we can add a theme to it to see what we come up with, so if you have any suggestions, let me know.</p>
