                <p>Well, I made it. I had originally been scheduled to fly out on the 2nd of January, but since I figured everyone would be tired and hungover on the 1st that I'd just head back then and get rested up for the grind again. After everyone left the hotel, I called West Jet to see if there were any openings on any flights. Pretty much the only one that worked was the 7am flight out of Toronto. Since it was already 4am, I figured I might as well just head to the airport and sleep on the plane.</p>
<p>Of course, once I got to the airport nothing was really open and the line ups were already pretty big. I did the express check-in thing, only to have to wait 30 minutes in a line up to check my bag. Needless to say I was pretty exhausted when I finally got through security and made it to the plane. I didn't want to sleep and risk not boarding, so I waited until I got on the plane to finally get a few winks.</p>
<p>I always love going away on a trip, but it's sort of nice also heading home and sleeping on your own bed again. I'll post a pile of photos from last night when I have a sec.
