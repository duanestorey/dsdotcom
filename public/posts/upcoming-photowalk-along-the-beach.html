                <p>I have attended a few photowalks in the last year, most of which have been in or around the Gastown area. These events have typically brought together anywhere from 5 to 50 people, and have usually involved people walking around and snapping shots for an hour or two. They are a lot of fun, and always a great chance for people to improve their skills or just get out and stretch their wings a bit.</p>
<p>I'm organizing one down in my neck of the woods for this Sunday. It will be mostly along the beach, eventually ending up near English Bay and the famous Inukshuk. Hopefully we'll even manage to catch a sunset at the end.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=6438414942">facebook event</a> for it if you're interested. If you're into photography and can get downtown this Sunday, make sure you come out and snap a few photos.</p>
