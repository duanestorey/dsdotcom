                <p>This is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/12/18/film.thehobbit.ap/index.html">hot off the presses</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema have reached agreement to make J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit," a planned prequel to the blockbuster trilogy "The Lord of the Rings."</p>
<p>Peter Jackson is set to oversee the film adaptation of "The Hobbit."</p>
<p>Jackson, who directed the "Rings" trilogy, will serve as executive producer for "The Hobbit." A director for the prequel films has yet to be named.</p>
<p>Relations between Jackson and New Line had soured after "Rings," despite a collective worldwide box office gross of nearly $3 billion -- an enormous success. The two sides nevertheless were able to reconcile, with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios (MGM) splitting "The Hobbit" 50/50, spokemen for both studios said Tuesday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm definitely glad that Peter Jackson is involved in this project. I think the potential to completely screw it up, especially given the commercial success of the first trilogy, is huge.</p>
