                <p>Chad's party last weekend was the first of the Christmas bashes, but they are coming hard and fast starting tomorrow. I just picked up a new pair of dress pants and my altered jacket from the tailor, and tomorrow I'm spiffing it all out down on Granville Island. There should be a small little pre-party at my pad near False Creek, and then a small little ferry ride over to Bridges, which is a fairly nice seafood restaurant right on the edge of the marina. Kasia won't be coming to my place beforehand because she apparently needs a gazillion hours to get ready before hand, so we'll just have to manage without her.</p>
<p>Should be about 100 people or so, taking over the entire upper floor, so it's bound to be a pretty fun time. This year they up'ed the ante a bit and set up a dance floor along with a DJ. Considering I work for a company of mostly geeks, this is bound to be great entertainment. I'm bringing my camera, so I'll do my best to document it.</p>

<p>Afterwards, like usual, we'll all make our way to a pub or a club somewhere and start the second party of the evening (memories of me dancing on a speaker come to mind). Check back in a day or so for all the photos from the parties. I'm going to be fairly busy for the next few days so I'm not sure how much I'll be blogging.</p>

<p>I tried my best to enjoy last year's party, but considering four weeks prior I was in the hospital, and still had a pile of bruises on my face from my first surgery, I wasn't really in a total partying mood. But I'm fairly excited about tomorrow, and it should be great.</p>
