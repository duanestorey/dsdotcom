                Well, I made it. I had originally been scheduled to fly out on the 2nd of January, but since I figured everyone would be tired and hungover on the 1st that I'd just head back then and get rested up for the grind again. After everyone left the hotel, I called West Jet to see if there were any openings on any flights. Pretty much the only one that worked was the 7am flight out of Toronto. Since it was already 4am, I figured I might as well just head to the airport and sleep on the plane.
Of course...

Tony and I met Christie for lunch, and then walked around and did a bit of shopping. I picked up a nice scarf and Tony got some gloves and a hat, so we're both officially winter people now.

After that I went back to the hotel and had a little nap prior to the little hockey game party we had at my hotel.

There's already one on Facebook that mimics the old version (although, it's basically a wrapper for a website that already has it), but I have some ideas that will sort of bring the game into the modern age, including a mobile component.
