                <p>I haven't written a blog entry in a few days because quite frankly, I've been absolutely swamped at work. I've been working on a big project for a few months, and we're hoping to be done a piece of it tomorrow. I have an IM conference going between a guy in Europe, and another guy out here, and we're all putting the final pieces together.</p>
<p>I'm officially dead tired. After I'm done with work tomorrow, I think I'm going to come back home and take a well-deserved nap to try and recharge after today. I'm going to finally do something on Saturday that I've been meaning to do for quite some time -- I'm going to go home and spend some time relaxing where I grew up. I told myself that I was going to spend more time this summer relaxing and enjoying it, but here we are in August already, and I really feel like I haven't really done much at all. Thankfully I still have a my holidays coming up in a few weeks, so I hope they are as good as I've been imagining.</p>
<p>I got some more information on the wedding I'm going to in Ottawa. It's going to be in a little town called Manotick, and it's at a Heritage site called <a href="http://www.watsonsmill.com/Home.html">Watson's Mill</a>. Looking at the photos, it seems like a pretty cool spot to have a wedding, and I should hopefully get some great shots from it. I haven't been back that way in years, and I'm really looking forward to walking down the Rideau Canal again, or having a beer next to parliament.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to leave my computer at home this weekend so I can have a weekend completely unplugged. If you notice a lack of blog entries, don't be alarmed -- I'm just taking a well-earned break.</p>
