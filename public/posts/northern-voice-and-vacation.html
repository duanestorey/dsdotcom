                <p>Tomorrow officially marks the start of the Northern Voice 2007 activities. <a href="http://www.northernvoice.ca">Northern Voice</a> is a Vancouver based conference where web-bloggers meet up and discuss various technological and social aspects of blogging. I've heard a lot of good things about it, and <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com">Boris</a> and his company <a href="http://www.bryght.com">Bryght</a> are the main organizers for it.</p>
<p>The main social is tomorrow night, which will be a great chance for everyone to meet each other and break the ice before the main activities begin. Friday is "Moose Camp", which is an opportunity for conference participants to gather around and form their own agenda based on things they want to discuss or participate in. I plan to attend the Photocamp which is being moderated by <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Kris Krug</a>. One of the things I'm excited to see is a real <a href="http://brightsidetech.com/products/dr37p.php">high dynamic range display</a>, courtesy of one of the attendees who does research at UBC. If I'm right, this puppy will make high definition seem obsolete.</p>
<p>The main conference is on Saturday, and the topics range from citizen journalism to legal aspects of blogging. And after the conference ends, I'm officially on vacation for a week. I still haven't the foggiest idea of what I'm going to do. I came close to booking a flight to Mexico the other day, and tonight I almost grabbed Vegas instead. I might just hop in the car with some tunes and see where the road takes me, but I just haven't had time to give it a whole lot of thought. I have a pile of blog entries I've started but never published, so hopefully I can finish some of those during the break, and also release a new updated version of the <a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/crossroads-plugin">Crossroads Flickr Plugin</a></p>
