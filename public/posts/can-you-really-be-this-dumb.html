                <p>I found something a little more dumb than me making perogies the other night. Here's a recent quote by Lindsay Lohan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lindsay Lohan says she's been going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for a year, but hasn't talked about it because "it's no one's business."</p>
<p>"I just left an AA meeting," the 20-year-old actress tells People magazine in a story posted Tuesday on its Web site.</p>
<p>"I haven't had a drink in seven days. Or anything," she says. "I'm not even legal to, so why would I? I don't drink when I go to clubs. I drink with my friends at home, but there's no need to. I feel better not drinking. It's more fun. I have Red Bull."</p>
<p>"I've been going to AA for a year by the way," Lohan adds. When asked why didn't she say so until recently, she replies: "Well it's no one's business. That's why it's anonymous!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Umm, is it just me, but if you're a) not legal to drink and b) don't really drink, then why the hell would you go to AA? And if you really were going for a year, why are you bragging that you've only been sober 7 days? If she really needs help, then good for her, but geez, get your story straight before opening your mouth.</p>
<p>I'm sure right after reading this, her publicist bashed her head repeatedly into the wall.</p>
