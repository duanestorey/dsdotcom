                I finished my antibiotics last week, which in theory meant I should have been completely fine and back to normal. Unfortunately, that's not the case, something that sometimes happens with this type of infection I have. I spent a bit of time in the doctor's office yesterday, and for whatever reason, they want a full spectrum of tests done again just to make sure they didn't miss anything. Except for some cramps, it's not really affecting me that much, but I'm anxious to be all over this.

I used to be in choir over 20 years ago, and I can sort of carry a tune.

In an effort to get my expenses down a few months ago, I decided finally to pull the plug on cable, something that I haven't regretted in the least. The only show I really watched last year was 24, and once that season ended, I just cancelled it all, saving myself $60 a month or whatever.

When I was 17, I was at a summer party in Chilliwack at this guy Geoff's house. Of course, being in a small town, we were all drinking our faces off at that point. Thankfully, most parties back then were in houses and everyone just spent the night, so for the most part we were all safe.

Most of my best memories revolve around the Christmas season -- either friends in my university dorm sharing some eggnog (with rum of course), opening presents with my niece and nephew, or watching it snow in Ottawa from my festively-lit living room. I don't know why, but I just get excited when I start seeing lights up.

I had checked out her blog occasionally, and I recognized her from photos both on her blog, and ones taken during Matthew Good's living room show last year. Being the social guy I am, and fueled by some liquid courage, I walked up to Rebecca (who was also on her way to acquire booze) and started chatting.
