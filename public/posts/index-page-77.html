                    I know for a fact that Leopard seems to work fine with Apple's router, but I've been having a lot of problems with Leopard and my Linksys Wireless N router here at home. Once and a while it will just give itself a self-assigned IP address and that's that. The only way to fix it is to reboot my Mac and my router, which usually causes it to grab a real one. Funny thing is I can switch to my neighbours connection (sssh, don't tell), and it works fine even in that state, so it's something about the Linksys it doesn't like.
Seems like there's a problem with 10.5.1 and some wireless routers. Mine actually ...

                    Today was a long, dreary day. I didn't get home until around 9:30pm, and barely had enough strength to pound back some left-over lasagna. I was really looking forward to sitting back and watching heroes tonight, but mininova was down and my internet connection turned out to be pretty flaky. Today was officially full of fail.
I've not been feeling myself lately, and I don't really know why. Maybe it's the weather, maybe it's because I'm still battling an infection, maybe it's lots of things, but I find myself pretty bummed out the last few days. One thing that's been bothering me lately is that ...

Plus, Sunday is usually laundry day, and I need to catch up on that.

I set up by Gmail/IMAP account on my Apple Mac Mail program. I'm not sure if I'm going to use it though. At least for me, it seems pretty slow. Not only does it seem to take forever to sync, but the CPU is fairly high even with the Mail program is idling. It might be related to the ...

My friend Raymi in Toronto has a very unique, and often copied, blog. So tonight, after getting a bit tipsy, I attempted to recreate some of her brilliance myself.

The end result is a funny parody, complete with drunk dancing by myself. You can check it out at duanetheminx.com.

There's another party tonight that I was invited to, but I'm not sure if I'll hit that. I think I really need a nice night inside with some movies.

                    In 1905, a research paper was submitted that forever changed how science views the world. In it, the author postulated that the laws of physics, which were at the current time regarded as universal, actually depended on the relative motion between the object and that of the observer.
The consequences of that paper are far reaching, for it implies that even the passage of time itself depends on motion. That is, two clocks that are absolutely synchronized at rest will no longer be synchronized if the clocks are forced to travel at different speeds. That result, proven time and time again in many ...

                    About six months ago I got it into my head that I wanted to play around with RSS technology and see if I could come up with something cool with it. That eventually turned into a standalone RSS reader I wrote for the Mac called TrollDigger. The one feature everyone liked is the ability to view the actual pages instead of the RSS excerpts. I haven't touched it since then, and the version that's currently available for download is a bit clunky, but I was thinking about spending a few hours on it this weekend.
To be honest, lately I've been thinking about a completely GUI-less RSS reader. I'd like ...

                    Today I had a specialist appointment to fully quantify the damage to my vision from my accident last year. The appointment was about an hour of waiting in the waiting room, twiddling my thumbs, and an hour of experiments. They were forced to dilate my eyes, which means not only am I totally sensitive to light right now, but I'm having a very hard time reading anything.

Not sure the verdict, but it's looking pretty likely that my double vision in my upgaze is probably permanent. I can potentially compensate for this by changing my eyeglass prescription to have a slight upward taper in the lens, ...

                    For some reason, I seem to get a lot of flack for getting ready for Christmas this early. There are those who can't possibly believe that someone would put their decorations up in November, instead waiting until the last minute to put theirs up.
For me, I love Christmas. I love coming home and flipping on the strand alongside my main window. I love being curled up on the couch with my duvet and a good movie, having no lights on except for the dim glow of my tree.
 My Christmas setup last year
I guess part of the reason is that while in university, Christmas always went too fast. By that time, ...

                    Last night I met up with Rebecca and John for some drinks at Fogg 'N Sudds on Robson Street. It's pretty much tradition with those two to watch any weekend hockey games down there, and whenever I can, I swing by to sample their fish bowl high ball drinks.
Afterwards, we all went over to Trevor's house and sat around drinking wine. Trevor has a pretty cool penthouse apartment in the West End with a great view of Vancouver.

                    So, I know there are a bunch of programs available on the Mac for doing photo work and what not, but I'd like to ask everyone what they use on a daily basis. I have for the most part made due with iPhoto, but the organization capabilities of it suck, and I end up with directories full of photos without any real means to identify them. Unfortunately, I also need something with a relatively quick workflow (photoshop is too slow to use for me except in extreme cases).
Any recommendations? ...
