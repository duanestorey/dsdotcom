                <p>We had a customer email us today saying they were having some issues with PayPal. For the most part, PayPal is pretty reliable when it comes to purchases for us, and we don't notice any hiccups. But today it seems like something was amiss within the computer walls at PayPal.</p>
<p>The post on PayPal's <a href="https://www.thepaypalblog.com/">blog today</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anuj from the PayPal comms team here. I wanted to let everyone know that we’re experiencing an issue on PayPal.com. It started at 8am PT today and means that almost all our members are having difficulty logging into their accounts and sending or receiving money from PayPal. We are working to get this fixed and I’ll update this blog post as soon as I have more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While we did have a small issue this morning, for the most part things seemed to run mostly smooth for the rest of the day. That said, some of the comments are from some pretty irate customers of PayPal, several of which say they are out thousands of dollars in sales today.</p>
<p>PayPal recently posted an <a href="https://www.thepaypalblog.com/2010/10/paypal-site-is-back-up/">update about their API here</a>.</p>
