            <p>So, something happened tonight that kind of irked me a bit. It was completely offset by the fact that I went out and did a pile of Christmas shopping, but all the same.</p>
<p>When I was 17, I was at a summer party in Chilliwack at this guy Geoff's house. Of course, being in a small town, we were all drinking our faces off at that point. Thankfully, most parties back then were in houses and everyone just spent the night, so for the most part we were all safe.</p>
<p>Anyways, in walked these two girls, one of which completely caught my eye. I spent a bit of time talking to her and her friend, and ended up leaving with a really great impression of them both. They went to Chilliwack Senior, whereas I went to Sardis Secondary, so I had never met them before. This one girl, and I won't use her name, but there was something about her I really liked. I spent the next few months wishing I could hang out with her again or maybe somehow cross paths with her once again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/390633225/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/125/390633225_3195005cd2.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></a>^^^ This is my universal photo for broken heart times</p>
<p>Not liking to leave my fate entirely to chance, I decided to take matters into my own hands. So, on Valentine's day, I purchased a pile of roses and found a willing attendee of her school to do the delivery for me. At lunch time my friend Rob delivered them to the office at her school and left them for her, wishing her a great Valentine's day from someone who thought she was pretty cool. I purposefully didn't put my phone number on it, because I figured if she somehow managed to get it then maybe she was actually interested.</p>
<p>Two days later I got the message on the phone to call her. Unfortunately, a bunch of crappy things happened (including a death in the family on my side) and we never really even hung out after that point. I always thought she was pretty cool, and whenever I ran into her in a bar in the years that followed, I would always say hi, even though I was pretty sure her friends thought I was a complete idiot.</p>
<p>The other day we added each other on facebook, and for a lark I told that story in the "Friend Details" part of it, because seriously, it's was 13 years ago and I think it's fairly funny.</p>
<p>Well, she deleted it, not wanting it on her profile. I mean really, what girl wouldn't to show that some guy, despite having next to no money and attending a completely different school somehow managed to shower her with roses (13 years ago!!!) on Valentine's day because he thought she was pretty amazing?</p>
<p>I don't get women sometimes.</p>
