    <article class="main section content">

            <p>Nearly two years ago, I went out with my dad and step-mom and picked up a high-definition TV at future shop. Of course, having a high-definition TV without any sort of high-definition feed is rather pointless, so the first thing I did is pick up a HD cable box from Shaw. Unfortunately, I didn't realize at the time just how little TV I usually watch.</p>
<p>Between the HD cable option and my "high-speed" internet, I shell out around $110 a month, which is pretty stupid considering I watch only around one TV show a week if I'm lucky. So, I think tomorrow I'm going to call up shaw and finally cancel my cable for my TV. What I'm going to do with the HD box, I'm really not sure. Maybe I'll throw it up on eBay and finance a HD DVD player (which I could see myself using far more, since I love movies and watch a few a week).</p>
<p>But to be honest, Shaw's HD TV service is pretty shoddy. Sure, they advertise around ten HD channels or so, but most of those don't show HD programs all the time. Half the time I tune into one, there's a low-definition program that they've just upscaled, or even broadcasted it directly. I also paid money to have the movie package, which gives me access to four movie-central channels or something like that. Unfortunately, most of the time I tune into one of them, there's only some crappy one-star or a two-star movie (not that the rating system is flawless, but you get the point). And despite having one of the premier packages with Shaw, it seems like whenever I want to actually watch something interesting (like a biography or some tech program), Shaw always complains that I don't have access to that channel.</p>
<p>So, I think I'm going to say goodbye to Shaw pretty soon. Thanks for all the one-star memories.</p>
