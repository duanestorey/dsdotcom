<p>I didn't see it live, but I read the highlights, and it's pretty much exactly what I thought it would sound like. Whenever I see Gordon Campbell talk, I can't help me feel that he's talking down to everyone, and that's the perception I was left with after reading his speech.</p>
<p>First, he apologized for not giving the province a heads up about the HST, but Ottawa didn't give him enough time. If that doesn't sound like the biggest copout ever, I don't know what would. Even if that's true, you gotta wonder about any deal that's shoved down your throat with a ticking stopwatch attached to it.</p>
<p>Second, while I like having more money in my pocket, I've never really understood why politicians give tax breaks when they are running big deficits. While, I guess I do understand, it's obviously political. But ultimately it just puts the province further in trouble, and serves to kick the can down the road for later.</p>
<p>I've actually read that consumption taxes (i.e. the HST) are better than income taxes because they only punish spenders, not savers. So, with that in mind perhaps getting rid of 15% of income tax and having the HST around may be a decent tradeoff. But still, the more I hear from Gordon Campbell, the more I look forward to a day when he's not at the helm.</p>
<p>What did you guys think?</p>
