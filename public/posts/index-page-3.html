We're only about two month's away from the US hitting its debt ceiling of 14.3 trillion dollars. Congressionally the US isn't allowed to borrow any more than that amount (the entire wealth of the population of the planet is around 100 trillion dollars - so that means the US owes almost 15% of the entire wealth of the planet in debt).
The estimated date of this occurring is sometime in late April of this year I believe. When it does, the US has two options: default on some of their debt obligati...

The Good
The iPad is great for reading at home, but it's not so good for reading out in public in a city with a lot of petty crime. In fact, I don't think I've seen a single iPad down here since I've arrived. As a result, I'm thankful I brought my Kindle with me, since it blen...

                This last weekend I had the opportunity to visit the world renowned Japanese Gardens in Buenos Aires. Outside of Japan, they are some of the largest Japanese Gardens in the world, and I have been looking forward to visiting them ever since I arrived.
The Japanese Gardens are located in Buenos Aires, just north of the Palermo area and the Buenos Aires zoo. I walked there from my apartment near Paraguay and Gurrachuga, and it took me about 30 minutes or so to get there.

Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later. At some level I'm almost relieved that it's out of the way. Somehow yours truly lost his bank card today.
I made two trips to the bank today, one to HSBC near Alto Palermo and one to CitiBank. At HSBC I took out 1000 pesos and at CitiBank I did the same. I made it back home, did some work, then went to a little coffee shop where I read for an hour or so.
When I got home from there I opened my wallet, and was surprised that my bank card wasn't in it....

                Had you asked me a few months ago about what language they speak in Argentina, I probably would have just said Spanish, assuming (erroneously of course) that all spanish speaking countries all speak the same form.
Now that I'm here, I know what a lot of people in North American probably don't - in Argentina they speak a fairly different form of spanish based on Voseo, and also have some very unique pronunciations.

The end result was a coin that was worth less, even though it was the same size, shape and colour.
Another form of inflation occurred when people used to subtlety shave the edges of coins off and use that metal to purchase other items. The coins ended up becoming deformed, and had l...

Ron Paul, one of the most vocal opponents of the monopoly the Federal reserve has in the United States, has just been appointed to the head of the Federal Reserve oversight committee. He's been denied the position twice before, most likely because he's been itching to audit the Federal Reserve and finally make the Fed accountable.
Well, today Ron Paul finally got the job, which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned.
Ron's been a long time advocate for abolishing the Federal Reserve completely...

As I blogged about previously, he was a bit flustered when he came by a few weeks ago, probably because he was towing the original owners of the suite along behind him. I had a bit more time to chat with him today, and as I suspected, the owners are a bit hard to deal with.
For the most part, he thought the apartment looked really great. The only complaint he had is that the carpets in the second bedroom ...

I'll admit, I don't get it. It's been four years now and yet Twitter is pushing forward with an advertising based revenue model (at least, pushing forward via a 3rd party).
I'm not Twitter, and for me to sit on the sidelines and recommend a revenue model for a service I'm not a part of is pretty weak. But that said, I honestly think people would pay for a Pro twitter service if Twitter would simply offer one. I think back to my days in the BBS era when we would all pay $50 (this is back in 1990...

That idea came out of a trip my friend Rob and I tried (unsuccessfully) to go on. We were both sick of our day jobs in Ottawa, had lots of money (compared to other 24 year olds), and had a long weekend coming up. So we started calling travel agents, telling them we didn't really care where we went, as long as we got the hell...

First of all, I should say that this is a BIG printer. When the courier arrived to drop it off you could tell he was having a hard time moving it. Once it was in my apartment, it basically blocked the entire front door. Being a typi...

                It's true, I'm a nail biter. I have been for as long as I can remember. I blame it on my mom, she was a nail biter too!
The thing is, I've been biting them so long that for the most part I don't even know I'm doing it. That's what makes it a hard habit to stop. It's not like smoking where you have to go find the pack, pull out a lighter, and then light up. I'll literally be on the couch and realize my hand is in my mouth and I'm biting.
I've actually never been successful quitting, but I'd reall...

                In just 45 days, I'll be out of my apartment out in Chilliwack, and essentially homeless for the next 30 days. Truthfully, now that my place is partially boxed up, I'm getting antsy to hit the open road. My current plan is to have a lot of my stuff already in storage around November 1st, so I can possibly go visit a few people in the United States in November.

As I mentioned before, I'm also heading to the Mayan Riviera in just three weeks, which will be a nice break from the norm. I haven't ha...

I pulled a pile of boxes out of storage today and started the packing process. I don't technically have to be out of my apartment until the end of November, but my plan is to have a storage facility rented for November 1st. At that point, there's no reason why I can't load it up and get most of the big stuff done. I'm also going to be pretty busy in November (I'll be in Mexico for a week, and have a few weekend activities going on), so I'm not sure how much time I'll have then to get it all don...
