                <p><a href="http://ajillstory.blogspot.com">Jill</a> emailed me on the weekend and said that since she met my challenge and changed a few lightbulbs, that perhaps I'd want to take a stab at her challenge. For those of you who don't know, next week is officially <a href="http://www.kindacts.net/ideas_resources/RAK_week/RAK_week.shtml">Random Acts of Kindness week</a>. And while I strongly encourage people to try and be kind for the rest of the year as well, this week is a chance to really up the ante a bit and see just how kind you can be to other people.</p>
<p>So, since it's officially Jill's challenge, let her know if you do anything out of the ordinary to try and make the world a better place next week. If you're a female and you want to be kind to me on Valentine's day, I think that would count as well.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy someone a coffee</li>
<li>Share your umbrella if it's raining</li>
<li>Help someone carry something</li>
<li>Clean someone's monitor at work</li>
<li>Change a lightbulb in someone else's house!</li>
</ul>
<p>Update - here are the random acts I have done so far (even though it hasn't officially started):</p>
<ul>
<li>Bought a girl poutine at Fritz on Granville</li>
<li>Gave a homeless guy (Ken) $10 near Seymour and Dunsmuir -- talked to him for about 15 minutes</li>
<li>Helped another homeless guy and his wife get some cardboard out of a dumpster to build a small shelter</li>
</ul>
