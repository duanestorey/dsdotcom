                <p>Last night we left Google at around 9pm and headed up to Palo Alto for a nice dinner. Derek and I both had flights this morning, so we thought we might as well move our hotel close to the airport. We grabbed a really cheap travelodge, which was one of the scariest hotels I've been in for a long time.</p>
<p>I somehow managed to misplace my laptop charger down at Google (more than likely, someone else accidentally grabbed it). That basically means I'm currently without a laptop and a cell phone. I'm hoping to get a SIM for my cell and hit an Apple store really quick to pick up a new charger. Hopefulluy that'll put me back on the grid in relatively short order. This is actually the most technologically disconnected I've been in quite a long time.</p>
<p>My flight here in SFO is actually delayed, so I'm just killing time. They offered me an upgrade to first class for only $50, which I gladly accepted. Not only do I get a nice big seat on the plane and free drinks, but I also got to go into a priority security line which made the wait about 5 minutes instead of 90.</p>
<p>The good news is my arrival time is almost exactly the same as that of my sister's and her kids, so I might get to run into my niece and nephew in LAX just as they get off their first plane ride.</p>
<p>I'm meeting up with Tony tonight down in LA tonight, so hopefully we'll get into a bit of trouble.</p>
