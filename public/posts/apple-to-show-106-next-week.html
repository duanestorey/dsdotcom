<p>I've seen a few rumour sites suggest that Apple is preparing to seed developers with an early 10.6 release of their operating system. You can <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/06/03/rumor-mac-os-x-10-6-to-debut-at-wwdc-08/">read about it here.</a> If true, it sounds like it's more of a maintenance/stability release, which makes me really wonder why they would name it a 10.6 instead of a 10.5.4. And to be honest, I'd be really disappointed if they were to release 10.6 as a real, full fledged (i.e. you have to pay more money) update to the operating system, considering Leopard isn't that old and that it's far from stable as it is.</p>
<p>It's obviously just a rumour, so I'm not going to worry too much about it, but I'm starting to question some of Apple's business practices of late.</p>
