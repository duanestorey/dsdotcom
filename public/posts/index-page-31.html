There are events all weekend, so make sure to check out their main web site if you are interested in seeing some local fashion. I just got an email saying I was on the guest list for the swim suit portion today, so I may hav...

Prior to that one moment in time, now forever etched into my memory, I was upstairs at the Railway Club in Vancouver, enjoying a few beers with some friends in celebration of their wedding earlier that night. Upon exiting the building, somewhere between catching a cab and eating a bag of nachos, I overheard these four guys harassing a bunch of ...

But yesterday, I suddenly got the urge to go outside and shoot some photos in the afternoon, so that's what I did. I didn't have my SLR, so I just shot with my point and shoot, which is always rather depressing. No matter - here are a couple shots of a surprisingly sunny Vancouver.

I am Christmas fanatic. I love hanging out in malls and watching people, or sitting at home listening to Christmas music. Last year I left my tree up until April, just because it made me sad whenever I thought about taking it down.
I've been known to buy random stuffed animals (including this huge ass duck) to give away to people during the holidays. There's a Christmas moose I bought who now holds my door open in my room.

Difficile sometimes lives in the intestines and is normally kept in check by a range of good bacteria that also live there.

                I had a meeting with my plastic surgeon today to talk about the last surgery I had. It's been a little over five months now, so in terms of results, everything should be stable.
In my opinion, the position of my eye, while better, is still not perfect. In addition, I still have double vision in the top-left version of my visual field. My plastic surgeon did a few simple tests on me, mainly involving looking at my eye and tracking its movement using a finger.
At least to my surgeon, the results a...

                One of the main advantages of digital photography over film photography, at least in my mind, is the ability to view the histogram shortly after taking the shot. While viewing the image on the LCD is obviously an advantage as well, it's difficult to tell if the shot actually turned out based on a small image on a 2-3" LCD.

A histogram shows you how many pixels in the image (shown on the vertical axis) are at each intensity level (0-255 typically, sho...

She's in the bathroom right now, and she stepped out for a brief second to say: "wow, you're pretty messy eh?" with a cute smile.
I think I can get used to having cute girls come to my place every few weeks and clean. Thankfully my place is going to be (and stay) spotless after all this.
One girl came on Friday to clean the living room an...

                Ok, this is a quick entry on something I've been meaning to write about for some time - tipping. For some reason, it seems like more and more places I visit now are introducing "tipping" into the system. In particular, a lot of interact machines I encounter are starting to show "please enter tip amount."
In the old days, you'd usually encountered a "Tip: Yes/No" question first, but I've seen the former more and more lately, and it's starting to piss me off. You see, I don't think you should tip ...
