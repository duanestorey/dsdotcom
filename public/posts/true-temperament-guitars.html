            <p>I stumbled across three interesting things tonight.</p>
<p><img src="images/3gphoneshot.png" alt="" />First, I purchased and installed <a href="http://www.bitcount.com/cleartune/?CFID=513690&amp;CFTOKEN=98832906">ClearTune</a>, which is a pretty kick ass guitar tuner for the iPhone. While a few people in reviews had issues with it, most of the individuals who got it working said it was the best tuner they've ever used. I have to say, it seems deadly accurate for me. It not only has a coarse scale, but it also has a fine scale, so you can see just how many cents you are off and adjust the string even further.</p>
<p>Second, since ClearTune supports a wide range of musical temperaments, I decided to do some research about guitar temperaments, which eventually led me to <a href="http://www.truetemperament.com/site/index.php">True Temperament</a>, a company that makes custom fret boards such that every string is in tune at every fret position (all guitars nowadays are a massive compromise -- the only position that each string is essentially in tune is when the guitar is played completely open, every other position is most likely out of tune slightly).</p>
<p>And third, I found this demonstration video by Steve Vai, one of the big advocates of the True Temperament designs. Apparently I need to practice a bit more.</p>
