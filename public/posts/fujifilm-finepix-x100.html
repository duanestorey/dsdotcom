<p>Matt Trentacoste was talking about this bad boy on Twitter the other day, and I've been passively thinking about it ever since. In short Fujifilm is releasing a compact camera that has some high-end image specifications. I suspect you're going to see more and more of this going forward. While SLRs are great, they are a big and bulky and hard to carry around. If you could get comparable image quality out of a smaller camera, it would be a game changer for the professional camera market.</p>
<p>So before you read too much more, check out the official site for the <a href="http://www.finepix-x100.com/">Finepix X100</a>.</p>
<h3>What I like About This Camera</h3>
<p>Here's a quick list of what turns me on about this camera:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a fast f/2.0 aperture which is great for most shooting scenarios</li>
<li>The retro look of the case is pretty hot</li>
<li>It looks like you adjust the aperture using the dial on the lens - also a throwback to how cameras used to be, and equally as hot</li>
<li>ISO from 200 - 6,400 (extendable to 12,800)</li>
<li>720p video</li>
<li>Ability to choose 3:2 aspect ratio of 16:9</li>
<li>Optics with 6 groups and 8 lenses (1 aspherical glass molded lens included) - probably means it'll be really sharp</li>
<li>Hybrid viewfinder - it's optical, but has digital stats overlaid on it</li>
<li>Ability to switch to RAW with a dedicated button</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty great specifications.</p>
<h3>What I Don't Like</h3>
<p>Looks peachy on first glance, but there are a few things I don't like.</p>
<ul>
<li>f/2.0 is fast, but not fast enough to hand hold shots inside of a typical bar at most ISOs. If ISO 3200 - 6400 are usable and relatively noise-free, it might be possible. But given that it's an APS-C sized sensor, I suspect you'll see quite a bit of noise at 3,200 and 6,400, which means no hand holding in those scenarios. Given that there are Canon cameras in the $500 range with a f/2.0 as well, it would have been nice to see f/1.8 or f/1.4 out of this lens.</li>
<li>Prime lens with a 35mm focal length. This is probably great lens for walking around, but pretty poor for doing any portraits. Not sure how practical this camera is without a zoom. They haven't announced any other lenses either, so seems very limiting to me</li>
<li>Only 300 shots per charge - good enough for most scenarios, but not a very pro number</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Think</h3>
<p>This camera is hot. Unfortunately at a price point of around $1,199 USD, I don't think I'm going to bite. I love all of the specifications, but the 35mm focal length is not very useful for a general purpose lens. It's interesting as a walk around camera if you're primarily interesting in cityscapes, but I don't think it's very useful for families or portraits.</p>
<p>That said, it comes out in March, so it'll be available when I'm in New York City hopefully. I'll definitely play around with one and see what I think. If I have enough beers before hand, who knows, maybe you'll see it here first.</p>
