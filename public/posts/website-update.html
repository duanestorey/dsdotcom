            <p>It's been about three days since I launched the new site, and I've had some great feedback regarding it (thanks everyone). I've made a few small tweaks based on some comments, so hopefully it's a bit better.</p>
<p>I've been watching my traffic, and so far I've consistently about double the traffic (actually, a tad bit more) since launching. I'm sure part of that is a transient contribution from launching a new site and Twittering about it, but I'm fairly certain the traffic will definitely go up, since there's now a lot more to do here now (specifically in the photography section). I'm also tracking bounce rate, and I'm hoping that goes down significantly for the same reasons. I generally don't care that much about traffic, but as a metric for gauging the effectiveness of a new design and/or content change, I think it's decent enough.</p>
<p>I've slowly been tinkering away at Crossroads as well. Last night I added client side caching of the Flickr API requests, which should make most photography pages load a lot faster (at least when the data is already in the cache). I also added all the code such that I can import Flickr comments into each photo area, but I'm holding off flipping the switch on that until I can come up with a decent way to present it (it'll probably be AJAX when it's done, as getting the comment avatars is expensive from a Flickr API point of view and I don't really want to slow down each page load because of it). Hopefully I'll have time to finish version 2.0 of Crossroads in the next few weeks and finally release it.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'll keep building this out over the next little while, and hopefully release a full featured photography theme at some point. Seems like there's definitely some interest in the microstock implementation as well, so I'll hack that out at the same time.</p>
