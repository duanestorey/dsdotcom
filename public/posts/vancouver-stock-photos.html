                <p>As most people know, I spent a lot of my time in Vancouver taking photos of the city. I was one of the first people in the city to dabble with high dynamic range imagery, and because I carried my wideangle lens around with me quite often, ended up with quite a few HDR images of Vancouver.</p>
<p>While down in the Dominican, I was talking to Dale about possibly putting together a little package for media organizations during the Olympics. While in the process of putting that together over the last few weeks, I figured I might as well put everything online as well. To that end, I registered the domain <a href="http://vancouverstockphotos.ca">VancouverStockPhotos.ca</a> the other day, and was up until about 5am on Saturday putting it together. Most of my Vancouver shots are now up for sale, primarily as stock photography, but also a few that are available in prints. As is always the case, many of the same shots are available as creative commons licensed photos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanestorey">over on my Flickr</a> stream. But for individuals and corporations looking for commercial use of the photos, they can be purchased from <a href="http://www.vancouverstockphotos.ca">VancouverStockPhotos</a>.</p>
<p>It's just a little fun pet project, which will hopefully generate a bit of money that I can use to directly finance photography in the future. As is, I haven't spent any money on new gear in the last few years, primarily because I haven't been able to justify the expense anymore. So hopefully as I build this out it'll help with that front.</p>
