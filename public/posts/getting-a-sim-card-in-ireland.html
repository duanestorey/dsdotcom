                <p>One of the first items I try to tackle whenever I hit a new country is to get a pay as you go SIM for my iPhone. If you are on a budget it's something that you may not want to do, but I find having data on my phone invaluable for various reasons.</p>
<p>Last time I was in Ireland, I opted for a Vodafone SIM card for my iPhone. I remember at the time it was reasonably priced and gave me 100MB or so of data. Since I was going to be in Ireland for a month though, I wanted to have more data. I look at Vodafone's pricing, but it started at around 40 Euros for the month for 1GB worth of data.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/o2-logo.jpg"><img loading="lazy" srcset="/assets/posts/2013/o2-logo-320w.jpg 320w,/assets/posts/2013/o2-logo-480w.jpg 480w" src="images/o2-logo.jpg" alt="Getting A SIM Card From O2"><span class="caption text-center fst-italic"></a> Getting A SIM Card From O2</span></p>
<p>A friend of mine recommended <a href="http://www.o2online.ie/o2/">O2</a> instead, so as soon as I arrived in Galway I went down to the O2 office to price out getting a SIM card in Ireland. Sure enough, they had a 1GB data plan for only 20 Euros, which I figured should last me nearly a month.</p>
<p>The O2 people were really friendly, and had me and my girlfriend up and running on our new SIMs in about 10 minutes. Most of the time when purchasing a pre-paid SIM card they will need to see your passport. But O2 didn't need it, or any other form of identification either.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, my SIM card displayed "No Service" for over 24 hours after putting my new SIM card in. When I went back to O2 the next day though they determined that my SIM card hadn't been properly activated, and quickly fixed the issue for me. Had I brought my phone with me when I went the first time I'm sure that could have been avoided, as my girlfriend made sure her phone was working before we left the store.</p>
<p>So in 2013 the best pay as you go data plan in Ireland that I found was for O2. Your mileage may vary, but for me 20 Euros to use my cell phone for a month around Ireland is a good deal.</p>
