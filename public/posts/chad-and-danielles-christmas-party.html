                <p>Last night I made the long trek out of the downtown core and ended up near Metrotown, which surprisingly isn't as far away as I imagined. Chad has a really nice pad out there, complete with an outdoor deck that would be just killer for summer parties and BBQing.</p>
<p>Chad has a tradition at his party where everyone has to pick a decoration for the tree, and then proceed to make love to it somehow. Not sure how this came to be, but everyone eagerly began licking and kissing their decorations.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/2095189742/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2322/2095189742_c7bd8be6ca.jpg?v=0" alt=""></a></p>

<p>After everyone had hit the beers in the fridge, Chad promptly dove straight into his massive scotch collection and started going crazy on that. After a few, he basically took position in his recliner like some dude out of masterpiece theatre and began to chuckle to himself occasionally. I was giving <a href="http://raymitheminx.com/">Raymi</a> a play-by-play via SMS, and when I told her Chad had hit the scotch, she replied with this:</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/2096214650/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2265/2096214650_fc2dc0bec6.jpg?v=0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Out in Toronto you see, they have this weekly tradition called "sober night", which seems to involve massive amounts of dirty martinis and drunken SMS messages from some grungy basement.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/2095440551/in/photostream/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2183/2095440551_2e28ff3e04.jpg?v=0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And of course another fun shot from Toronto "sober night":</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/39729207@N00/2094246773/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2414/2094246773_581222b409.jpg?v=0" alt=""></a> Photo by <a href="http://exhausticated.com">Christie</a></p>
<p>Chad was also attempting to send drunken SMS messages, but was having massive difficulty navigating his phone pad. I heard various "fucks" and "oh shits" and he somehow sent half completed messages to his friends, followed promptly by a rather large sip of scotch, and a further descent into the comfort of the recliner.</p>
<p>At one point Chad and Danielle demonstrated the yearly Christmas Breast-Feeding-The-Bottle-By-A-Manger move, which was a big hit.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/2095200948/in/set-72157603401940868/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2023/2095200948_2f001d7c79.jpg?v=0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Danielle was a gracious host, making sure we were all stuffed full of chips, salsa, layered dip and wings. Very tasty.</p>

<p>It was good times. I have zero plans today. I think I'll check my back account happiness level and then maybe go shopping.</p>
