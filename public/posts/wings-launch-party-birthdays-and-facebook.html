            <p>Well, it's almost the weekend again. I awoke this morning to some major construction going on in one of the units around me, and I sure hope it's done before Saturday morning rolls around.</p>
<p>Last night I hit Wings on Granville with Rebecca, Keira and John. For those of you who haven't been, it's a quaint little spot next to the Howard Johnson hotel on Granville Street that has cheap wings from 2-6pm daily.</p>

<p>The girls basically did two pitchers of beer by themselves, so I imagine they were feeling pretty tipsy by the time they left.</p>
<p>This weekend is already shaping up to be fairly busy. Tomorrow night is the third <a href="http://raincitystudios.com/blog/summoning-all-tech-women-watch-appies-and-snaps">Launch Party Vancouver 3 down at the Lamplighter in Gastown</a>. I've been asked to come shoot some photos of the Vancouver technology community, so I'll swing by and do that. I finally picked up a proper flash diffuser for my 430EX flash, so hopefully I can make good use of that if it's a bit dark.</p>
<p>Saturday night a few of us are getting together for a few more wings and probably some bowling. Chad and Danielle are also having their engagement party, which I'll probably swing by at some point as well. Monday night is the <a href="http://barcamp.org/FacebookCampVancouver2008">Facebook Developer Garage</a>, and it's looking like I'll be the official photographer for that event. <a href="http://miss604.com">Rebecca</a> will be live blogging the event and linking to the photos in real-time, so make sure you check it out.</p>
<p>I've been going pretty much non-stop since Christmas time, so I've decided that next weekend is going to be a me weekend. I'm probably going to hop in my car (or on a plane?), turn off my cell phone, and get the hell out of dodge for a weekend. Looking forward to that.</p>
