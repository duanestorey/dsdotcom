<p>I've been working on a travel eBook for a few months now, mostly on airplanes and during the odd evening. It's been slow going since I have a lot of other things going on right now, but I've managed to make a bit of progress each week. I'm pleased to announce that last night I managed to put the finishing touches on it, and it's now officially available.</p>
<p>My travel ebook contains two main topics: how you can make and execute plans for long-term travel (anything more than a week or two), and how you can redesign your life to make traveling easier. There are lots of great resources include, such as the top travel services I use on the internet, where the best places to find cheap travel insurance are, and some of the best motivation and business books I've read during my travels.</p>
<p>The book is now available as a 47 page PDF file. If you read it please drop me a line and let me know any feedback that you have as I will likely revise it from time to time, and would ultimately like to eventually release a larger version on Amazon.</p>
<p>If you're interested, you can get your free copy of <a href="http://mignerd.com/book">Beginner's Guide to Long-Term Travel and Lifestyle Design</a> now.</p>
<p>Thanks again, and enjoy!</p>
