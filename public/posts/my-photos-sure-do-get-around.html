                <p>As everyone who hits my blog these days knows, I really like taking photos. My passion for photography started about seven years ago, and is still going strong today. I've been fortunate enough to be able to afford a really nice camera and a full suite of lenses, and while I sort of understand what's needed to take "good" photos, my camera really does the majority of the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>My friends routinely use my photos in blog posts (which I really appreciate), but every once and a while I do a quick search via <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> to see who else is using my photos. Tonight, that search led me to one of the coolest sites ever to link to a photo set of mine -- a semi-local blogger and nude-model, <a href="http://www.krismadison.com/blog/2007/07/summer-fun.htm">Kris Madison</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to <a href="http://www.krismadison.com/blog/index.htm">head over and check it out</a>, by all means. I should point out though that it is definitely <strong>not safe for work</strong>.</p>
<p>I would like to encourage all other nude models in the city to link to my photos. If you have any trouble, please do not hesitate to contact me -- I'd me more than happy to assist you.</p>
