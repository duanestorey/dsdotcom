                Well, as you can see, I've started making changes to this website. They are far from done, but I think I've made enough headway to put it back up for a while. Here's what I have done so far:

Made a new theme, borrowing a few elements from the "default" wordpress theme
Added a custom flickr plugin that has read/write access to my flickr account
Added the ability to associate abritrary images or sets from flickr with any blog entry. These images can be viewed using the ImageBox javascript library...

                Where to begin. I actually had thought that the last post I did would be my final one before taking the website down and completely revamping it. But a couple things happened tonight while sitting on my couch that inspired me to write one final one before retooling the website.
Lately I really feel like I'm entering into the next phase of my life. Maybe it's turning 30 soon, or maybe it's all the events that happened over the last few months, but I've spent the last few months trying to figure a...

                Hey guys.. I've been thinking about completely revamping this website for quite a long time. Unfortunately, every time I start it, I always get sidetracked and end up throwing away a lot of the changes that I've made before.
However, I'm going to make some pretty major changes to it soon. Which means, I'm probably gonna take the site down for a while, probably starting this weekend. I have some pretty big ideas about what I want to do, and I'm not even sure I have the skill set to do them all. S...

I will however briefly mention my quest for a wine collection. I've been hauling this shitty Ikea wine rack around with me for years, knowing full well I'd never have more than one or two bottles in it at any one time. Finally, I decided I'm going to change that, and what better way to do that than to enlist the help of a friend.

Afterwards, Andre and I headed over to Six Acres in gastown to keep the beer flowing.

I've swung multiple ways during all the debates, sometimes favouring Blue-Ray and sometimes favouring the HD-DVD. Technically, Blue-Ray is superior technology, but HD-DVD is easier to manufacture, and is cheaper to produce. I've been waiting anxiously for a clear winner to emerge to I could finally go buy one of these things. I mean, most of my research at UBC was in the area of high definition, so ...

Let me tell you -- you really don't realize how many contractions your use until you have that frickin search box take focus from you whenever you type one. Whenever it would happen, I would just stop using contractions in my head and write stuff out, but not only does that a) sound really dumb, but b...

                I had the need to make a few state machines today, and grew tired of doing them on paper. Derek pointed me towards GraphViz, which is a graphics package capable of doing finite state machine diagrams. All you need to do is generate a simple text file that outlines the state transitions, and their "dot" program will output the state machine diagram for you. Pretty nifty.
Here's a simple example I did:

                A new study says people who have full-fat milk gain *less* weight over time. I hate to say I told you so, but I'm not a big believer in the whole "fat makes you fat" belief. I agree saturated fat isn't very good for you, but the other types of fat are. As long as you don't eat the grissle in a steak, over 2/3 of the fat in it is good fat, which is better than most other things. Which gives me an idea for another blog entry later tonight.
