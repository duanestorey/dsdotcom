                <p>I've been taking it fairly easy this week, spending a lot of time at home (when not at work) resting up. I've been on anti-biotics for a few days now, and while my bronchitis is subsiding, my stomach has been bothering me. Not sure if that's related to the infection I acquired last fall, or if it's just the anti-biotics upsetting my stomach -- I guess I'll know for sure when I stop taking them.</p>
<p>There are a few things going on this weekend, but to be honest, I think I'm going to bail on everything and just rest. I think I might go get groceries tomorrow morning and then spend the rest of the weekend reading and drinking coffee. Lately it seems like there is just so much going on that it's hard to find time to relax, so I think this weekend I'm going to make some time and just hang out at home.</p>
<p>I posted about my camera the other day, and it's for sure gone. I left it on a table for about 2 minutes while I walked to go take another photo -- when I came back it was gone, which sucks. Oh well. I don't have much luck these days.</p>
