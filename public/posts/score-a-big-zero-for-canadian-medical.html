            <p>Here comes another rant:</p>
<p>As most of you know, back in November I was in the hospital with pneumonia. While there, I picked up a hospital acquired infection known as c. diff. It's unfortunately rather common these days mainly due to the lack of cleanliness in hospitals (and also due to the abuse of broad-spectrum anti-biotics in hospitals). But without a doubt, it's a serious infection, and is responsible for many deaths. The superbug the media focuses on is MRSA, but in terms of fatalities, c. diff kills about twice as many people. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/03/11/bc-superbug-strikes-mother.html">Just last month it claimed the life of a mother</a> who went to the UBC hospital to deliver twins.</p>
<p>I spent a few months battling it with my family doctor, and eventually he referred me to a specialist at St. Paul's hospital. I went through a few runs of anti-biotics, and for the most part felt ok again. For the last few weeks though, I've been having a lot of upset stomach and some cramps, which reminds me of some of the things I went through before. So my family doctor said to go back and see the specialist again for a follow-up.</p>
<p>I called down today to St. Paul's and asked if I could get in this week to see someone. Their response? "Sorry, nobody is around for at least a week who knows how to book appointments." I was like, "are you serious?" So, they want me to call back later next week, and maybe someone will be back who knows how to use a pencil and paper.</p>
<p>Way to go Canadian medical.</p>
