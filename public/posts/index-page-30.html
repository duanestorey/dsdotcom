                For those people that know me, I'm pretty serious about nachos. I'm the only person I know with a complete lack of a sweet tooth. Chocolate, pies, cakes, candy, gummy bears, sugar -- you could starve me for a week and put that stuff in front of me and I wouldn't crave it at all. But put a plate of gooey, cheesy nachos in front of me and that's a different story.

I've slowly honed my nacho-making ability over the years to the point where I'm pretty much a nacho snob now. When I was down in Portl...

It seems so long ago now, but I once had pretty messed up teeth. Back when I was about 13 I had my first visit with the ortho, and they started to plan the torture regimen for the next few years. First, because my teeth were so crowded, they extracted four permanent teeth from my mouth. That still didn't provide enough room, so they cemented this little device to the roof ...

I tried that polish you put on them that tastes bad, but that didn't even come close to stopping me. Basically you just get used to the foul taste and chew anyways. The thing is, most of the time it's not even conscious, it's just one of those things I end up doing while driving or sitting ...

I actually stumbled across an 1,100 page culinary manual on the internet a while ago, and have slowly been absorbing it. In addition, I've been passively thumbing through various cookbooks I have around the house looking for dishes to try making over the next few months.

While I've never had it, San Francisco sushi is supposed to be pretty tasty as well, although many of my friends who have had both prefer Vancouver sushi.
