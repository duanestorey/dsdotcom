                <p>Well, I'm not actually sure if it's today, but Dave Olsen recently had a birthday. I've had the pleasure of getting to know Dave in the last year or so through Rebecca and John, and he's an outstanding guy with a real love for the Internet and his friends. Not only is he an amazing podcaster, but if he were about 75 pounds heavier I'm pretty sure he'd be one of the few people to keep up with me at the bar, no doubt about it. In addition, Dave and I have actually been cooking up a little web kung-fu that we'll be talking about real soon.</p>

<p>I was down in San Francisco this weekend, but had I been in town I would have gone camping with Dave and had a few beers. But hopefully Dave and I will get to hang out soon and have a few cold ones.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday bud.</p>
