                <p>I met with Rebecca and John tonight and we started finalizing the plans for <a href="http://barcamp.org/wordcampwhistler">WordCamp Whistler</a>. We're hoping to nail down a venue in the next week or so, at which time we'll open up official registration. Given that we want to make the event as awesome and as interesting as possible, we're going to be charging a small admission for the event. In addition, we'll also be accepting sponsorship from a few organizations, which will hopefully cover the costs of the venue, and the social.</p>
<p>Stay tuned in the next week or so for some official announcements. As of now, the date is still set for January 24th, 2009 up in Whistler, BC, Canada. We'll probably schedule the event to start around 10am or so, which will allow people to commute up from Vancouver that morning. We're hoping to invite some well known speakers to the event to share their knowledge about blogging and WordPress.</p>
<p>Right now we're targeting somewhere between 50 and 100 people for the event, so drop a comment or sign up on the wiki if you're interested. There's also a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=32574477561">Facebook event that you can sign up to</a>. As of today, there are around 31 confirmed attendees, with around 44 maybes.</p>
