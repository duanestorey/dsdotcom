                <p>Well, I've had a few sales on the photography website already, so thanks everyone for plugging it -- I really appreciate it. I'm going to canvas a few stores this weekend and see if I can get some of my stuff into the local markets. I've been racking my brain for a few out of the box ideas, so hopefully I'll be able to take the marketing a bit further. I'd like to get some of my work nicely framed and visible in a few areas with high traffic. If anyone has any friends or know of any businesses that wouldn't mind a few photos on the wall, let me know!</p>
<p>For those of you expecting free prints, please be a bit patient as it will take me a few weeks to sort everything out. I've put in a few hours myself for prints, and once I get those I'll mail a few out to people.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone.</p>
