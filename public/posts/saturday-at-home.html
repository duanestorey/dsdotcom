                <p>It's been quite a while since I've been home on a Saturday night, and I have to say it's been a nice change. I spent most of today walking around doing errands, and tidying up at home a bit. I bought some new stainless steel pots and pans, so maybe I will actually start cooking at home again. I even made a decent batch of chilli tonight, which is pretty amazing considering I've only cooked once or twice in about six months.</p>
<p>My eye was bothering me quite a bit today. Most days it's pretty good and it feels normal, but today it felt all dry and scratchy, which put me in a crabby mood. I found out on Thursday that my doctor is away for the next two weeks, so I'll have to wait at least that long to figure out what the results from the CT scan were. I guess I shouldn't really be excited about getting the results, because essentially all it means is that I'd have to have another surgery, which is not something I'm obviously too eager to pursue. I've spent a ton of time reading and trying to understand everything about the injury I had, and based on what I now know, it's probably never going to be 100% again considering the displacement of the bones in the back of my eye. I still have persistent double vision in about 25% of my visual field (due to certain muscles of the eye being damaged), something I've slowly learned to compensate for by moving my head instead of my eyes. I also still only have limited sensation on the left side of my face, and still can't feel my lip or gums on that side at all. Rock on.</p>
<p>I picked up my SLR for the first time in over a week, and it was nice to head out and shoot some photos with a decent camera again (I fuckin hate my other camera -- it ruins almost every shot). I took the ferry down to Granville Island today and bought some more wine in an effort to replace what was consumed during the last week. I was only going to buy a few bottles, but came home with seven new ones since they were having all these specials. That should last me quite a while I hope. I'm also supposed to be making some wine with Kasia and friends soon, but we just haven't gotten our butts in gear.</p>
<p>Here are some of the recent photos I've been messing with.</p>
