            <p>After work I swung by the Alibi room in Gastown to help celebrate Jeremy Crowle's birthday. I was a bit tired from this whole week so didn't end up staying out super late, but I managed to drink a few rum and diet cokes and buy Jer a beer.</p>
<p>There's another party tonight that I was invited to, but I'm not sure if I'll hit that. I think I really need a nice night inside with some movies. I have to hit the airport in a sec and drop my friend Hesty off for the start of his vacation. After that I'll probably check out the <a href="http://www.eastsideculturecrawl.com/">Eastside Culture Crawl</a> with some friends.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://www.miss604.com">Rebecca</a> and <a href="http://www.audihertz.net/blog">John</a> are currently airborne heading down to Iowa for a week -- you guys better bring me back something really cool, like a cow.</p>
