I really know nothing about it, other than people go and bend in various directions for an hour or so at a time. I had a few friends in Vancouver who went religiously, guys too, and they always seemed pretty pumped about going. I've been trying to come up with more things to do when I'm not working, and things that involve exercise or being healthy are at the top of the list these days. The gym is great and all, but treadmills and dumbbells get a bit boring after a while. I'm also hoping I can meet a few more people in the class and get to know some of the locals.</p>
<p>I guess the first order of business would be getting a Yoga mat? Where does one go to buy one? Are there good mats or bad mats, or are they all pretty much the same?</p>
<p>Any pointers or suggestions would be great.</p>
