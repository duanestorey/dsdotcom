                <p>Well, after nearly three weeks, I'm finally back home.. I left April 14th for Tokyo, Japan, bounced through Vancouver on April 24th, landed in San Francisco on April 25th, and finally arrived in Vancouver late last night.. Man am I tired.. But wow, what an amazing trip. I have never been off the continent before, and it was really amazing going to a completely different place, both geographically and culturally. Thankfully, I don't have any trips planned, since I'm completely exhausted.. But who knows, in another month or two maybe it will be time to fly again.</p>
<p>As you might have noticed, I also decided to try out some new blog software. This one is called WordPress, and it's available at www.wordpress.org. So far I'm pretty impressed -- it sure as hell beats my old php scripts. I figured out how to tie it into flickr too, so now I think I have a pretty decent set up for blogging.</p>
<p>Oh, and tomorrow, the CounterPath people are all taking the afternoon off and doing a motorboat scavenger hunt in Howe Sound.. It should be a great time -- look for the photos from that when I get back.</p>
