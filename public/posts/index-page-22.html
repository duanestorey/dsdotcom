                I've been trying to find out ways to get myself out of the apartment in the evenings and get a bit more exercise. I've actually being going to the gym quite a bit over the last three months. That's fine and all, but hitting the elliptical trainer and lifting weights gets a little boring after a while, especially if you don't have a gym buddy.
So, based on some recommendations from some friends, I thought that I'd try out a few yoga classes.

Truthfully, I had always sort of stayed away from it because I thought I wouldn't like the avocados in it. But really good guacamole is addictive, and I was eating it like it was going out of style in the Caribbean. In fact, I was putting it on hamburgers, hot dogs, chips -- you name it.
I've made about ten batches of guacamole in the last year, each time refining it a bit. It's actually getting to be pretty good...

I originally was going to go sometime this fall, but I was starting to feel more and more like it was a bit too rushed. I also wasn't entirely sure how to deal with Christmas: spending $1,500 on a plane ticket to get somewhere doesn't make a lot of sense if you're just going to get on a plane and head back home again a month or so later for Christmas.

I strolled down at around 9:15am or so, only to be greeted with a line that not only snaked all the way down the halls inside the mall, but had spilled out onto the streets, wrapping down Granville for about 3/4 of a block.
