                <p>I friend of mine recently asked if I was putting all my beer recipes online, and I unfortunately was forced to answer no. When I started brewing I tried to put them all online, but the write-ups just took too long.</p>
<p>So I've decided to start posting them again, but in a very limited format. That way it doesn't take me long to post them, and hopefully I can solicit input from others.</p>
<h4>Beer Information</h4>
<p>My goal for this beer was to make something easily drinkable for some of my family that generally prefers lagers, and tend not to like really bitter ales. I find most blonde ales a bit boring, so I mashed it at 152F to add a bit of body to it, and also used some left-over hops (in small quantities) from a recent IPA I had. I'm hoping these end-up having a subtle presence (due to the lower amounts used), even though they are hops with noticeable characters on their own.</p>

<p>Here are the target stats for this brew:</p>
<ul>
<li>BJCP Style: Light Hybrid Beer, Blonde Ale</li>
<li>OG: 1.049</li>
<li>FG: 1.012</li>
<li>IBU: 17</li>
<li>Color: 4.7</li>
<li>Batch Size: 5G</li>
<li>Boil Duration: 60 mins</li>
<li>Mash Temperature: 152F</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grain Bill</strong></p>
<p>Fairly typical grain bill for a low gravity ale, although I added a tiny bit of wheat malt for some added complexity. Had I had normal Canadian 2-row malt on-hand I would have used that, but instead I used grains from my sack of Pale Alt malt.</p>
<ul>
<li>11lb 8oz - Canadian Pale Ale Malt</li>
<li>8oz - Wheat Malt</li>
<li>4oz - Caramel 10L</li>
<li>2oz - Caramel 15L</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hop Bill/Schedule</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>0.25oz Citra @60 mins</li>
<li>0.25oz Centennial @30 mins</li>
<li>0.25oz Chinook @10mins</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fermentation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yeast: Wyeast 1056</li>
<li>Temperature: 68F</li>
<li>Duration: 2 Weeks</li>
<li>Dry-hopping: None</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>I haven't tasted this one yet, as it's been clearing in a fridge at home for the last 5 weeks. But I'll update this post when I get back and tapped. Looking at it before I left though, it seems slightly darker than predicted, likely because the SRM for the pale alt malt I used didn't quite match the one in BeerAlchemy. Not a big deal though.</p>
