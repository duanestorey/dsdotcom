                <p>We're up to about $530 now. I'm hoping we can hit $1000, which means we basically need about $100 an hour. That's a big goal, and I'll need the help of every reader to pull it off. If you want to know more information about the United Gospel Mission, please head over to their website or send me a personal email via my contact page.</p>
<p>When the iPhone 3G came out a few weeks ago, along with it came the new 2.0 firmware that brought many new features, including the coveted application store. Unfortunately, with the update came a pile of bugs, including problems with the GPS unit, and a completely unresponsive user interface.</p>
<p>The good news is that the new 2.1 firmware is due to be released any day now. Hopefully that will bring a pile of fixes and make the iPhone 3G usable. Right now there are random crashes, and a sluggishness in the UI that makes the device extremely hard to use.</p>
<p>If any of you have had any problems with your device, drop me a comment.</p>
