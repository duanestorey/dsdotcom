                <p>Sometime this summer, my friends Mike and Kim are gonna finally tie the knot together and live happily ever after. I've known about their wedding for a few weeks now, but tonight they stepped up and asked me to officially photograph their wedding for them. To be honest, I've been asked before by other people, mostly over a few drinks, and up until now I've basically always politely declined, mainly because I didn't think I could pull it off properly and do it justice.</p>
<p>So, after spending a few hours mulling it over tonight, I finally realized that I'm probably ready. Not only that, but most everyone at the wedding has known me for a very long time, I think I'll be able to push the envelope a little further than another photographer would, since I know most of the nuances of the people who will be there. That's not to say I'm overconfident about it. To be honest, shooting a wedding is pretty intimidating -- you only get one shot to capture this moment forever. But with some research and lots of practice before the day comes, I think it will be just fine.</p>
<p>So, Mike and Kim, I hope you're ready!</p>
