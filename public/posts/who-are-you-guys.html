                <p>So, I've been meaning to ask this question for a long time. Yesterday I had a pile of traffic, thanks to a few inbound links from some massive sites. I broke into the thousands for unique visitors, which doesn't happen that often in Duane-land. Given that only about ten people ever comment, I gotta ask, who are the rest of you guys? Nearly 50% of you are returning visitors every day, and yet you lurk in the shadows, thick as thieves I say.</p>
<p>The lack of comments either means:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm really boring</li>
<li>YOU'RE really boring</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm pretty sure I am not boring all the time, which means it JUST MIGHT BE YOU! :)</p>
<p>So, if you swing by and read this, drop a quick comment and say hi! Tell everyone where you're from and what you want for Christmas. Don't be shy.</p>
<p>If you've commented before, say hi anyways and introduce yourself!</p>
