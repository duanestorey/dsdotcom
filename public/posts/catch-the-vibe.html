                <p>Last week both <a href="http://miss604.com">Rebecca</a> and I got contacted by General Motors asking if we wanted to take part in GM's <a href="http://catchthevibe.ca/">Catch The Vibe</a> event. It's basically a huge multi-day adventure race, where we would have, as teams of four, gotten to test drive the new 2009 Vibe, live-blog using new Blackberry's, and drive all over the city looking for clues and what-not. Included with the festivities was a free night at the Opus Hotel in Yaletown.</p>

<p>Unfortunately both her and I have day-jobs, and we just couldn't manage the time during the day. It looks like a really fun event, and it would have been cool to take part it in. But check out their website and watch the events unfold over the next day or two. Hopefully they do something like this on a weekend one time where I can take part in it.</p>
