            <p>I travel to the United States quite often with work. Maybe not as much as I used to, but for a while there I was down here every month or two, visiting California or other cool places. So, for the most part, I know what to expect in most states. I don't even really think about it anymore really, I just hop on a plane and change a few of the subtleties when I talk to people (I go out of my way not to so Eh). However, the one that always trips me up is the word "Pop".</p>
<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/181/405479857_8ba31e9e3e.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Because in the US, most people don't know what the hell Pop is. So whenever I say it accidentally, I always get that deer in the headlights sort of look like I've been smoking crack or something. Most people here call it Soda, so Pop just doesn't work. It's the one thing I just haven't figured out yet.</p>
<p>And while we're on the subject of Pop, I'm always pleasantly surprised when I get down here and see the ample selection of Cherry flavoured pops, especially diet ones. Brennen and I used to come down here on purpose years ago just to get a few Cherry Cokes. I'm not sure why we don't have them up in Canada, but they really are quite good. So today I think I had four or five cherry diet cokes, and I loved every minute of sipping them.</p>
<p>I didn't really do anything too exciting today, except for walk around a bit and change some plugin code around for the images on my website (I'm so cool, I know). I think tomorrow's goal will be to get a nice HDR of Mt. St. Helens, but we'll see how I feel when I get down there.. I hauled my tripod all this way, so I should probably use it once or twice.. I'd like to go down to the Oregon coast, but that makes the return trip home at least 7 hours, something I'm not too excited about doing in one day. Maybe I'll spend one more day travelling and then head back to Vancouver for a day or so before I go to Chilliwack We'll see..</p>
<p>Here are a few more shots from the trip:</p>
