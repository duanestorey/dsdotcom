                <p>As many people know, I'll be heading to Europe right after my trip to New York City. I officially arrive in Ireland on April 6th, and will be spending the next few weeks around the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Castle-View-Day.jpg"><img src="images/Castle-View-Day-300x197.jpg" alt="" title="Castle-View-Day" /></a></p>
<p>Europe is expensive, there's no doubt about it. Most hotels are around $150 a night for anything decent, and many hostels get bad reviews for what they charge. Since I've been living pretty cheaply in Argentina, I'm going to live it up a bit in April.</p>
<p>Ireland was definitely on the schedule, as was London (briefly, as I've been there before) and Paris. But given that I had a full week to kill in the area prior to Dublin, I thought I would head north and visit Scotland.</p>
<p>I'm flying from Shannon to Edinburgh at the start of the week and then from Edinburgh to Dublin at the end. Together those two flights are around $180 CAD total, a bit more than usual because I'll need to check a bag. I found a great five star hotel on Hotwire on sale for $120/night, so I grabbed that for the week. So already I'm up to nearly $700, but I'll get to see one of the nicest cites in Scotland, and also get to get a few great nights of sleep.</p>
<p>The hotel is the <a href="http://luxuryscotland.co.uk/sheraton/">Sheraton Grand Hotel and Spa</a>, and it's right in a great part of the city for exploring (next to a castle I might add).</p>
