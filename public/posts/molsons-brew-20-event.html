                <p><img src="images/brew-20-004.jpg" alt="" />I woke up to an email inviting me to a big Molson event down at the Burrard Street Brewery next week. It's an event geared towards some of Vancouver's web 2.0 saavy people and bloggers that involves sampling various beers as well as a special blogger brew that they have cooking up just for us.</p>
<p>It actually sounds like a ton of fun. Given that I can demolish a few beers without much effort, I think I'll definitely swing by and check it out. A few other of the night's attractions will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kerry Scarsbrook &amp; Gord Rickards, creator of Rickardâ€™s Red, will be in attendance.</li>
<li>Molson Brewery founder John Molson's great-great-great-great-grandson, Geoff Molson, will be there and will be telling some tales about how his family started 222 years ago</li>
<li>The menu will be crafted specifically for beer-pairing by Blair Rasmussen, Executive Chef at the Pan Pacific.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds like a great time, and I'm looking forward to it. The event will take place early next week down at the Burrard Street Brewery. You can also <a href="http://blog.molson.com/community/2008/06/27/how-about-some-brew-20/">check out some photos from the Toronto event back in June</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks Molson!</p>
