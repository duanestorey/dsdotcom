                <p>As per my last post, I was supposed to spend the weekend in Bangkok this weekend and then head to Auckland on Monday. But given how <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/thailand/8850545/Thailand-floods-Bangkok-Hilton-evacuated-as-city-prepares-for-worst.html">people are evacuating from Bangkok</a>, I decided to try and change my flights around to get out before things get even worse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/6285017354_eff2339d81_z-1.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/2011/6285017354_eff2339d81_z-1-232x350.jpg" alt="" title="Waddles"><span class="caption text-center fst-italic"></a></span></p>
<p>Thankfully most airlines (including mine, Air Canada) are offering free change fees on flights to and from Bangkok due to the flooding crisis there, so my ticket was eligible for a change. I tried calling last night to sort it out, but unfortunately due to the time change I didn't get the ticket office in time before it closed. This time I managed to get it in time, but was originally told there were no flights out until Monday on Malaysia Airlines (which is the carrier I was on). I then asked if they could put me on another partner's carrier instead, and they said they'd look. After about ten minutes of poking around they found a Thai Airways flight leaving Bangkok for Auckland, so I changed everything to that.</p>
<p>In fact, it works out quite a bit better in the long run. Malaysia Airlines isn't a part of the Star Alliance network, so I wouldn't have been able to accumulate any mileage on them. Thai Airways is, so I'll bank another 6,000 miles or so. I also had to bounce through Kuala Lumpur before, sit in the airport for ten hours, and then proceed to Auckland, arriving there shortly after midnight (which makes getting a hotel tricky). With the new arrangement I leave at 7:30pm at night and get into Auckland at around noon on Saturday. So in general it's just a way better arrangement.</p>
<p>That means tomorrow is my last full day and night in Koh Samui. Tomorrow evening I'll do a bit of packing, some cleaning, and then head out for one last evening of dinner and drinks with Scott and Sam.</p>
<p>So in about 36 hours I'll officially be migratory again, and once again heading into the southern hemisphere for yet another summer season. I'll do a post about Thailand on my way out, but in general I had a really great time visiting the land of smiles and some of south east asia.</p>
