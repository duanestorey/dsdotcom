                <p>My mom reminded me tonight that at this time in exactly two weeks, I'll no longer be in Vancouver. The time sure has gone quickly. I actually get the keys to my new apartment on the 15th, so I might head out on the night of the 14th and grab them in person.</p>
<p>I've been slowly organizing things in my current apartment, and strangely enough, I really don't have that much stuff here. I'll probably load up my car on the 14th with all my valuables and drive those out to Chilliwack myself. I also need to find my Shaw cable modem, which apparently I'm to bring back to Chilliwack for them to reactivate. On the 18th I'll grab the truck and do the final deed.</p>
<p>The only thing I still haven't quite figured out is what to do about a phone. I'm going to keep my current Vancouver number since I still plan to do a lot of work in the Vancouver area. Unfortunately though, the intercom system in my new apartment requires a phone number so that it can call your phone. I doubt it'll work with a Vancouver number, which basically means that I'll have to get a Chilliwack number. Vonage is still around $20/month, with around a $70 hit just to sign up. I don't know what Telus is, but I suspect it's similar. Roger's will be at least $20/month to add another number onto my account, so basically I'm looking at at least $240/year, simply for the privilege of letting people into my apartment. Maybe I should just install a gong outside or something that people can whack to get me to let them in.</p>
<p>A friend asked me last night if I was nervous at all about this. Truthfully, not really. I'm more nervous about <a href="http://www.wordcampwhistler.com">WordCamp Whistler</a> than I am about starting a new career. I think if anything I'm comforted by the fact that whatever happens over the next year, I'll be essentially 100% in charge of my own destiny.</p>
<p>I have ten more days of work left, and then I'll be done. I'll spend most of that time transitioning myself out of my current role, and helping bring others up to speed. My final day will undoubtedly be pretty weird. I have a lot of friends at work, and I watched the company grow from around 8 people all the way up to 150 or so. That being said, I'll be happy when I'm on the other side of January, sitting on the couch in my new place in front of my gas fireplace.</p>
