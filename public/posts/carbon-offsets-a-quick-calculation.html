                <p>I was doing a little research on carbon offsets this morning, and just for yucks, wanted to price out what it would cost to be a supplier of carbon offsets in Canada. There are various ways to offset carbon, but a fairly standard one is to plant trees in exchange for money. How many trees can you plant on an acre of land? Well, turns out <a href="http://www.hybridpoplars.com/space.htm">this guy has it all figured out</a>, at least for poplar trees. If you space them 10' x 10', you can get around 436 trees on an acre.</p>
<p>The average tree consumes about 1 ton of CO2 over it's lifetime, which according to <a href="http://www.tcf-fca.ca/calculator/">this website</a> is around 80 years. So over the course of 80 years, 436 trees will offset 436 tonnes of CO2. The going rate for carbon offsets are around $5 - $15 per metric ton of CO2 reduced. Let's pick $10 per ton as an example. So at those prices, we need to be able to purchase land for less than $4,360/acre in order to make our venture at least break even.</p>
<p>I haven't done any looking around, but $4,300 an acre sounds pretty cheap, and I'm not sure you could find that anywhere near a city. Maybe when I have more time I'll redo this calculation using some firmer numbers, and also include the yearly property taxes.</p>
