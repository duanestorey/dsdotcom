                On Monday I made the trek to Chilliwack out from Vancouver. The timing was actually perfect, since the roads were fairly bare when I left Vancouver, and are now pretty clogged up with snow. It's been snowing off and on here in Chilliwack, but at least driving around is feasible. The forecast is currently calling for rain for the next few days, followed by more snow probably on Monday. That basically means I'll be making the journey back into Vancouver sometime this weekend, hopefully before the ...

                So, I had to wear a pulse oximeter over the weekend and ended up back in Burnaby this morning to go over the data recorded by the machine. The final verdict is that I have a mild form of sleep apnea, which basically means that I stop breathing from time to time during the night, and it usually causes enough stress on my body to make me to wake up so that I can breathe.
Given that I've had high blood pressure most of my life, and that high blood pressure is often a symptom of sleep apnea, it's po...

Driving in near white-out conditions is never a good idea
The stock tires on a Mazda 3 Sport are complete garbage. Given that they are 17 inches, you might as well be driving a toboggan in the snow

It's been going on for so long that I can't even remember if there was a time when I used to sleep soundly or not. I often wake up every hour or so and feel rather anxious, and most nights it takes me at least an hour to nod off. It could be the traffic or some sound that wakes me, but I've never really been sure.

Two main factors led the Board to raise the CD levy rate to 29Â¢. First, the mechanical royalties that record labels pay to record a song onto a prerecorded CD have increased. Second, because consumers now use compression t...
