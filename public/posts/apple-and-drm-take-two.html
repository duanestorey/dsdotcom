                <p>In the last couple days, I've read several reports of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070530-apple-hides-account-info-in-drm-free-music-too.html">people discovering embedded user data in the new DRM-free versions</a> of music on iTunes.</p>
<p>While I'm not suprised, having embedded user data within these files is essentially a form of Digital Rights Management, which at the very least points to false advertising by Apple regarding these new music files. I'm quite certain that a utility will exist shortly to strip it out, should people want to, but Apple is being very guarded about these files and exactly just how DRM-free they really are.</p>
<p>I personally have no problem with my user data being embedded, since as long as I transfer these files between equipment I personally own, nobody will ever see that data but me. But, Apple needs to make this clearer either through their advertising campaign, or in the end-user license agreement (near the top, not the bottom).</p>
