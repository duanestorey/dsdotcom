                <p>Today is of course Remembrance Day. It's a holiday here in BC, but unfortunately I'm at work today. Ultimately, that's not a bad thing, since in exchange we're getting some extra time off around Christmas time.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/214/473896885_4338c57d4b.jpg?v=0" alt="Rain" /></p>
<p>There's a lot I could say about today, but browsing around the Vancouver web it seems others have already said it for me. But I'm obviously thankful for the sacrifices others made so that we can enjoy the freedoms we have today.</p>
<p>Outside it's rather dismal out today. I ended up driving to work, which is something I don't typically do since it costs me around $20/day to park downtown. But the nice thing is I'll be able to drive home after work and enjoy the heated seats in my car. Tonight is most likely going to be a couch and blanket night, since it's pretty gross out there. Now that my tree is all lit up, there's a bit more ambiance in my living room which makes it all the more comfy.</p>
<p>I got asked at work today if I want to go to Austin, Texas for the weekend. I don't think I'll end up going, but I can't say that I've ever been to Texas before. In my mind there's the typical stereotype of beer drinking, cadillac driving cowboys, which I'm sure is pretty far from the truth. More than likely I'll be in Vancouver this weekend though, although one of these weekends I'd like to head back to Chilliwack and relax on a couch with a book.</p>
<p>I went to the doctor's office yesterday with a pretty large laundry list of things for him to look over. The first thing I talked to him about was the c. diff infection I got last year. While the last test came back and basically said I was over it, I've had nothing by stomach and gut problems ever since. I was told at the time that many people develop irritable bowel syndrome after going through what I did, and that after a while it would probably resolve. But given that the symptoms are fairly similar to how I felt when I was still undergoing treatment, and that it's been this way for nearly a year now, I just want to make sure we're chasing the right problem. So we're going to do another test for some things -- this time I did my research and asked the doctor for specific tests with regards to the infection, tests that normally aren't done (but should be based on the latest strains that are going around) in basic practice, but ultimately yield better results. So, we'll see what happens.</p>
<p>Also, I haven't really had a full night's sleep in years. A typical night for me involves tossing and turning most of the night, often waking up ten times or more. Obviously that leaves me kind of bagged in the mornings. I pretty much need ten hours or more of "sleep" on a weekend to actual feel like I rested somewhat during the night. So thankfully I have a referral to a sleep specialists to finally do some tests.</p>
<p>So tomorrow morning I'll probably swing by the lab and get pricked and prodded for a while. With luck I'll have the results back by early next week. The referral to the sleep specialist probably won't come for a few weeks, but they were hopeful I'd meet with the guy before Christmas. I can't tell you how nice it would be to sleep through the night for a change.</p>
