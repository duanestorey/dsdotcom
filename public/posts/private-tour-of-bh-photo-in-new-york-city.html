                <p>I've been blogging a fair deal about my upcoming trip to New York City, and how one of the highlights for me is undoubtedly going to be visiting B&amp;H Photo in New York City. B&amp;H is an extremely well known photography store, and it's been on my list of places to visit for many years now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/BH.jpg"><img src="../assets/posts/2011/BH.webp" alt="" title="BH" /><p class="caption text-center fst-italic"></a></p></p>
<p>Thanks to the power of the Internet, Hershel Waldner, Supervisor of the Online Marketing Department for B&amp;H Photo, contacted me and asked if I'd like a private tour of the facilities while I'm there. Obviously, I said yes!</p>
<p>So, I'll be visiting B&amp;H Photo while I'm in town and also getting a full tour of the behind the scenes action at B&amp;H. I'll be taking some photos and hopefully some video, and I'll happily post about my experience when it's all done.</p>
<p>As I've pointed out before, I'm also going to be picking up some new gear while in town. Right now I'm leaning towards picking up a full micro four thirds system and a few lenses, but we'll see. I may also ditch that idea entirely and pick up either a new lens for my Canon SLR, or a new full-frame body to take with me instead (haven't decided between a Nikon or a Canon - I'm leaning towards Nikon). So many decisions, so little time.</p>
<p>But I'm very excited to go on the tour, so thanks to Hershel and everyone at B&amp;H for extending this opportunity to me.</p>
