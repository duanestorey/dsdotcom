    <article class="main section content">
        <div class="container">
            <p>A friend of mine on Twitter posted a question today asking if anyone had done any world travel, and if so, what they thought of taking a laptop with them. Since I just got back from four months of world travel, I thought I would write an entry detailing my experiences with backpacking with a laptop.</p>
<p>I spent the majority of my time in the city of Buenos Aires in Argentina. I brought along my 13" Macbook Pro, which is valued at around $1,500 in Canada. There is actually a lot of petty theft in Buenos Aires, so I avoided taking my laptop out for the first six weeks or so. But eventually that became tiresome - what's the point of bringing a laptop to a foreign country if you can't use it?</p>
<p>I actually imagined what would happen if someone were to steal my laptop while traveling. The cost of that very same laptop in Buenos Aires would have easily been $3,000 - $4,000 due to import restrictions. At those prices it would have been far cheaper for me to simply get on a plane, fly to Houston (10 hours of flying in each direction), buy a new laptop, and fly back. That's not a joke. There are also many parts of the world where replacing an expensive laptop is simply not an option.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I think everyone who plans to do day or weekend trips in a foreign part of the world should take along a cheap netbook. If you simply plan to email friends and family from time to time or upload the odd photo, then I would rely exclusively on the netbook and leave the expensive laptop back home.</p>
<p>If you have to take a nice laptop, then bring a netbook as well. When you're somewhere safe or familiar you can bring the nicer laptop out. But in new areas or new countries, I would simply take something cheap along to minimize the cost and hassle if it were either stolen or lost.</p>
<p>I plan to do some traveling again in the fall, and the first thing I'm going to do is to go buy a new netbook. I'm not planning on anything fancy, just something that I can take with me to write the odd blog entry or to catch up on news in various coffee shops.</p>
<p>The general rule while traveling is to never bring anything out with you that you can't afford to lose. I think that's a good philosophy, and one that I tried to adhere to. I often left my iPhone 4 at home (since it was a hot item in Argentina) and I routinely traveled while leaving my Macbook Pro in the apartment I was renting.</p>
<p>But if you need to take along a laptop I would strongly suggest bringing a cheaper netbook along as well for the reasons mentioned above.</p>
