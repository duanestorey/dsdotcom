                <p>I love the smell of Saturday in the morning. The sleeping in, the sound of traffic that pulls me out of bed at 11am. It's not very often I get full days to myself these days, so when I do get them, I definitely enjoy them. I'm just demolishing my second cup of coffee, and then will probably hit the open road for a few hours.</p>
<p>I went by the hospital last night to see my friend Clay. Clay had a quintuple bypass surgery, but is doing relatively well. As I well know, being in the hospital totally sucks, so I'm gonna swing by for a bit. Then, who knows. Maybe down to Urban Fare to get some groceries. Maybe out to commercial drive to take some photos. I haven't been outside with my camera in quite a while.</p>
<p>I went over the internet real quick this morning to see if there was anything interesting I could write about, but I didn't see anything that tickled my fancy. So for now, this is it.</p>
