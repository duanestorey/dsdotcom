            <p>I was talking to Rebecca tonight about how easy it is to forget all the things in life that are important. Too often people focus on the negative things, and forget all the people and things in their lives that make them happy on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So tonight I walked around my apartment taking photos of things that make me happy at home. I added them all to a Flickr set called <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/sets/72157606482162371/">Things That Make Me Happy</a>. It's a work in progress, and I'm adding a few old shots as well, including this one of me and some friends that snuck under the radar.</p>

<p>I had a ton of fun doing this, so I'm hoping I can encourage others to as well. So, if you have Flickr, go ahead and <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/802307@N24/">join this group</a>. Then, go through your Flickr set and add ten photos that represent things in your life that make you happy. Let's see what it looks like in a few days. Don't be shy!</p>
<p>I'm going to add mine now!</p>
