                <p>I took a quick 20 minute break from blogging, mainly to lay my head down on the couch here at Workspace at try to rest my brain. Compared to the noise levels nearly 12 hours ago, when Blogathon began, one might think that it's basically over here. People are still blogging away (so much so that when I closed my eyes briefly all I heard was the tappity-tap-tap of fingers scurrying across keyboards), but I think at this point most people are rather exhausted.</p>

<p>Most people probably think that writing entries every 30 minutes is fairly trivial. The truth is the opposite -- it is extremely demanding, especially if you try to vary your content or stimulate your readership at all. It's hard enough to write a blog entry or two a day, let alone 49 of them. If you also couple the generation of blog entries with photo taking (something I'm also doing), there's even more work to do, as it involves post processing photos, uploading to Flickr, and also tagging and uploading of content to Facebook.</p>
<p>Like most people here, I've written an extra blog entry or two such so that I have a bit of slop room in case something comes up. For example, I really needed a quick break, so I simply posted an entry I wrote a little while ago for my last entry. The trick is to write when you feel energized, and take a bit of down time when you're feeling a bit tuckered out.</p>
<p>Donations are still open for the rest of the night, and will probably be open until tomorrow sometime as well. If you'd like to donate to the BC Children's Hospital Foundation, please <a href="http://bit.ly/1axb0z">do so my clicking this link</a>. Thank you for all your support so far.</p>
