                <p>That's it really. I no longer carry cash for the most part. My paycheck arrives in my bank account electronically. When I pay for things, I use my credit card, debit card, or paypal. My bills are paid via online banking, and except for a birthday card once a year, rarely use snail mail. I probably receive 5 pieces of mail a month, but receive around 100 emails a day, and currently have 13,050 messages in my gmail inbox. The fastest way to get a hold of me (even beating out phone calls) is actually via email these days.</p>
<p>I ripped most of my CDs to my computer last year, and primarily listen to MP3s now. I can't remember the last time I put a physical disc into my drive. In terms of TV, I use Apple TV primarily now. I spend the majority of my time in close proximity to a computer, and in a regular day, bounce between my iMac, my Mac Pro at work, and my Macbook Pro at home. For the most part, including my cell phone and it's limited access to the internet, I am always online.</p>
<p>In terms of writing, I only use a pen for writing the odd cheque. The last time I tried to write anything of any length, my hand got tired after no more than a page and the writing was horrid.</p>
<p>It's weird to think that kids growing up today may not ever touch a CD, or have the need to carry cash. That learning how to write with a pen or pencil may someday not be a requirement.</p>
<p>As we move forward, it's often easy to forget the things we invariably have to leave behind. I'm sure every generation has to watch this occur, but I can't help but think how strange it is that so many the things from my youth are becoming dated, and will eventually fade from use and into memory.</p>
