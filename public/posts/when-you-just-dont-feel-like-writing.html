                <p>I haven't written on here in a few days now. That's a long stretch for me. Truth is, I'm just kind of busy and a bit bagged. I haven't been sleeping all that well lately, and feel like I'm a walking zombie. I was feeling pretty nauseous all yesterday, and didn't really eat that much. I hardly slept at all last night and woke up feeling like I was going to throw-up, so I decided to work from home today and try to save what's left of my body here.</p>
<p>I decided a few weeks ago that I'm taking this weekend off. I don't know what I'm going to end up doing, but I'm really hoping it doesn't involve a computer. I'd like to actually go to gym for a change, or maybe a nice long rollerblade. I might take a drive up to Whistler, or just hang out at home on the couch and watch movies.</p>
<p>Canon released the next version of the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/17/AR2008091700456.html">5D</a> the other day, something I've been waiting for for about two years now. The MSRP is around $2700 I think, so it's going to be out of my price range for a while. To be honest, I'm debating reselling my HD camcorder now and putting that money towards the new 5D. I shot some video a few weeks ago with it, but the workflow is just way too involved for me to have fun with it. But we'll see.</p>
<p>Apparently Molson tried to deliver beer to my house this morning, but I didn't hear it or something. I'm definitely excited about having beer show up on my front door. There's just something natural about that, kind of like when milk used to be delivered in the old days. I bet a company that delivered beer all over the city by Friday at around 4pm would make a killing. I'd pay to have my fridge stocked all the time.</p>
