                <p>So that stupid opacity problem has finally pissed me off enough to start to do something about it. There has to be a bug in my theme somewhere that's doing it, but I haven't been able to pinpoint it exactly. For now I'm switching to this theme, even thought it's a bit buggy too (it's only temporary)..</p>
<p>Actually, after disabling my theme and all plugins, the problem still exists in other themes.. I've only noticed it on my mac using Camino or Firefox, so I wonder if there's something wrong there.. I don't see the problem on a PC. Grr...</p>
<p>** Update - so, after spending a few minutes on it, I'm prepared to say this. It's in no way related to any plugins I am using, and the opacity problem spans multiple themes by multiple authors. And it only seems to affect Mac OS X and any browser based on the Mozilla engine (including Camino and Firefox). Weird. So, if you want the problem to go away, you have to use Safari for now.</p>
