                <p>So while many of us suffer from the end products of love, and some of us end up broken hearted, my friend Clay is the only guy I know who actually has, quite literally, a broken heart.</p>

<p>Clay is currently down at St. Paul's hospital getting a coronary bypass operation. Not a very enjoyable way to spend Valentine's day. I just called down and he's still in surgery. I'll probably swing by later tonight if he's out of the ICU, or more than likely tomorrow. If anyone has that stupid fish game with the hoops and the water, let me know. I'm sure Clay will swing by my blog in a few days and check it out, so if anyone wants to leave some well wishes, just drop a comment for him.</p>
