                <p>Thanks to everyone who has pledged so far. I'm currently up to $140, which will ultimately go to the Union Gospel Mission. I'd like to hit at least $1000, so if you want to sponsor, please <a href="http://miss604.com/blogathon">head on over</a> and contribute. I'll keep everyone updated during the event.</p>
<p>You can also subscribe to the <a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/tag/blogathon/feed">RSS feed</a> for my blogathon posts.</p>
<p>Tonight at 10pm I start blogathon, a 24 hour blogging marathon that will hopefully bring some exposure to the charity of my choice, the United Gospel Mission. The <a href="http://ugm.ca">Union Gospel Mission</a> is a charity in Vancouver that helps people in need:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Union Gospel Mission has been providing hope for the hungry, hurting and homeless since 1940. With 12 facilities placed between downtown Vancouver and the city of Mission, UGM is ideally positioned to help those who need it the most. Employing a full-time staff of approximately 130 and relying on a broad base of loyal volunteers, Union Gospel Mission provides meals, shelter, education, counselling, housing and more to hundreds of people each day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first post will go up at 10pm, and I'll continue blogging until 10pm Saturday night. I doubt I'll get a chance to sleep in that interval, although I may try to write a few posts in advance and maybe grab 30 minutes of snooze here and there if I can.</p>
<p>To support me (and hence the cause I've chosen), please head over to the <a href="http://www.miss604.com/blogathon">Blogathon donation page</a>. If you have a blog, it would be great if you can do a little plug for the event as well. In addition, if anyone encounters any article that you think is interesting, please <a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/contact">contact me</a> or <a href="http://del.icio.us/duanestorey">send it to my del.icio.us account</a> to give me the goods. Thanks everyone.</p>
