                <p>There is a relatively new device called "The English Mosquito" which is being used in England to control where young people typically gather.</p>
<p>The device works by emitting high-frequency sounds that only young people (typically younger than 20 years of age) have the ability to hear. Because it's fairly annoying, it causes young people to eventually leave a particular area. Human right's groups are <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/02/12/uk.mosquito/index.html">obviously unimpressed with the blanket use of the devices</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aynsley-Green said about 3,500 of the devices are in use across England to split up gatherings of youth in areas such as parks and shops.</p>
<p>"These devices are indiscriminate and target all children and young people, including babies, regardless of whether they are behaving or misbehaving," he added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently some people feel that having young people gather in a place like a park is a huge problem. I mean, it's quite possible they might pull out a soccer ball or a frisbee and start playing, and who knows what else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[..] Shami Chakrabarti, director of the human rights group Liberty, said: "What type of society uses a low-level sonic weapon on its children? Imagine the outcry if a device was introduced that caused blanket discomfort to people of one race or gender, rather than to our kids.</p>
<p>"The Mosquito has no place in a country that values its children and seeks to instill them with dignity and respect."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And while most of the groups that are resisting these devices are in the UK, the availability of these items for sale on the Internet is already <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Children39s-chief-calls-for-ban.3768795.jp">worrying individuals in other neighbouring countries</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John Loughton, from Pilton, chair of the Scottish Youth Parliament and recent Big Brother winner, said: "If ever there was a device which highlighted the terrible way in which young people are treated in society then this is it. Since when did standing in an area become a crime?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I obviously think that the use of a device like this is complete lunacy, but what I'm fairly surprised with is how every article I've read justifies the device by saying it helps eliminate "anti-social behaviour" by driving kids away. Wouldn't kids striving to hang out together in groups constitute social behaviour? I mean, when I was a kid it was cool to get together with our friends in parks, parking lots and even in front of the local 7-11. We weren't looking to create trouble, we were just looking for something to do.</p>
<p>If kids really are causing problems then pick up the phone and call the police -- don't discriminate against all kids with a device like this simply because you're afraid of a few bad apples.</p>
