                <p>I get enough of these types of emails that I basically don't even really read them any more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Duane,</p>
<p>For the release of a future worldwide success story, I'm urgently looking for a Linux debugging expert with very strong knowledges of C/C++!</p>
<p>They're implementing the ANDROID (Java) mobile operating system running on the Linux kernel, then looking for someone who knows Android architecture and API's. To resume: -Strong C/C++ knowledges -Experience with Linux Kernel development, and various Linux distributions -Testing, and Linux/Unix development skills</p>
<p>You love Brussels, are excited by working in an international environment with offshore team, and available ASAP, this is your job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are a couple of things that bother me when I get these:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not really a Linux expert, something they'd know if they scanned my resume on this site. I also don't have any ANDROID experience</li>
<li>The grammar and spelling are screwy in a few spots -- I'm expected to proof read my resume before submitting it, I think they should do the same</li>
<li>I have no idea what Brussels is like. Given that my website is obviously Vancouver/BC based, it would probably be more effective to tell me things about Brussels I would like, or have a few links to life in Brussels</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, I obviously already have a job I like, I just have never understood the lack of personal touches to these types of emails. It's like going in for a job interview and having the interviewer read your resume for the first time while you're sitting there -- leaves a really bad taste in one's mouth.</p>
