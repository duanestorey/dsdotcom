                <p>Wow, I just woke up. Not a very exciting day, but it's nice to have a good rest. I got up earlier and went for a walk, stopped by the plant shop, and headed home to see what was on TV. I was pleasantly surprised that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333766/">Garden State</a> was on, so I watched that (I saw it about 6 months ago, and really liked it -- although Natalie Portman was a bit stiff as always). Several things stuck out this time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natalie Portman isn't a very good actress (IMO)</li>
<li>Zach Braff directed the movie (I didn't know that the first time around)</li>
<li>He also looks a lot like John Ritter did when he was younger</li>
<li>The soundtrack kicks ass</li>
</ul>
<p>After the movie, I went online and "bought" the soundtrack, and proceeded to fall asleep on my couch listening to it. And here I am now, awake at song 12. I think I'm going to charge up my iPod, put the soundtrack on it, and head outside to see where I end up.</p>
