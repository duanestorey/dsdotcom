            <p>I have, for the last few years, had an idea about something I've wanted to do involving technology. I was talking to Boris about this a while ago, and I'm pretty certain this actually has a real name and has been done many times before in various cities. But for now, I'm just going to describe what would happen, and we'll decide an official name later (until of course Boris wakes up in whatever country he is in and chimes in).</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/357784954/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/151/357784954_9c3451663c.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The idea is that over the course of one full weekend (that is, starting Friday at 7pm until Sunday at midnight) you get a team of people together to develop a product/service/technology completely from scratch. In my head I am thinking that it would be basically a weekend-long sleepover involving donated beer, good people, music, and tons of know how on various aspects of the web world and technology. It will undoubtedly be one massive geek-filled coding session.</p>
<p>I am going to do my best to find sponsors for beer, a location, food, etc, but we're going to need people who can contribute something to an effort like this, and who can give up basically an entire weekend in the pursuit of something cool. Sleeping bags will be definitely be required, as will massive amounts of caffeine redbull mixed with booze.</p>
<p>To pull this off, we will need the following (so if you can contribute any of these, please chime in with a comment below).</p>
<ol>
<li>People who can contribute technical skills to this effort (web design, php, c++, ruby on rails, web platforms, drupal/wordpress, perl/python, you get the idea)</li>
<li>People who can contribute other skills (food runs, massages, live internet research, photography, podcasting, videocasting, blogging)</li>
<li>Sponsors for food, beer, and a venue (depending on the number of people I have a few locations in mind already)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're interested, or can help locate any of those items, chime in on the comments below. We can brainstorm ideas the night of or shortly before the event, but I'm secretly hoping whatever it is we do has some kind of mobile component as well.</p>
<p>I'm tentatively thinking that this event would occur sometime in early April (let's say April 4-6 right now). If you can throw some link-love this way, I'd appreciate that too (post this to your facebook accounts if you got 'em!). Thanks. PS (The name is going to change as we hash things out, but keep checking back - we'll finalize something shortly).</p>
