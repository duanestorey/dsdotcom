                <p>Well, the event is all over now, and I officially have a small hangover to remember it by. I met a lot of really great people last night at the social, and it was a ton of fun. I have yet to meet a blogger I didn't like, and last night was no exception. Everyone was friendly, and a pleasure to hang out and drink beer with.</p>
<p>The social event was at Pete's Tavern, which is conveniently located directly across from the baseball stadium. The bar was completely open as were the pool tables upstairs, so there was lots to do. I tried my best to walk around and meet as many people as I could, but I'm sure I missed a few.</p>
<p>I actually went down to WordCamp not really expecting to learn a great deal of information (since I try to keep up to date on everything I can). But surprisingly, I found every session informative and learned a great deal about what's happening with the web, about how to market your website/service, and even about how to optimize websites to make them load (or appear to load) faster.</p>
<p>I'm currently sitting in San Francisco's international terminal, waiting for a grilled chicken panani to magically appear in front of me. My flight doesn't board for a little while yet, so I'll probably spend some time writing or surfing. Jason lent me his little portable broadband connection which has a SIM card in it tied to an unlimited data plan. So right now I'm using that to surf the web for free.</p>
<p>Virgin America offered me an upgrade to first class this morning, so I took it. Considering I don't plan on drinking at all on the plane, it doesn't really offer anything extra except for a larger seat and an easily accessible bathroom. Hopefully I'll be able to grab a quick nap before I land in Seattle, as I still have a three hour drive ahead of me when I land (assuming I can find my car again).</p>
<p>Also, if you want a really great recap of the event, <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/weblife/?p=143">check out this live-blog</a>.</p>
