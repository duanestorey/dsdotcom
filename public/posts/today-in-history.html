                <p>Well, today there are at least two important events that happened in the past.</p>
<p>First, on January 15th, 1977, my friend Brennen was born. Since that time he has pretty much been a major pain in my ass, causing me to lift boxes for weekends at a time, to fix countless porn-infested computers, and to drive out to the edge of the world (White Rock) on weekends. That said, he's a great friend, and I hope he has an awesome birthday today.</p>
<p>Also, at this exact time last year I was packing up the last few things in my desk in Vancouver and leaving my job there for the last time. Hard to believe I've been gone for a year already, but that's how the math works out.</p>
