                <p>Yesterday I didn't really have much time to blog, and I doubt I will today either. I've just been a bit busy with everything.</p>
<p>Looking outside right now, it looks like there's an official snow line in the mountains around downtown, which probably means skiing and snowboarding will start soon. It's a fairly nice day in Vancouver (in fact, it's been really nice this winter so far), and you can check out a live feed if you want at <a href="http://katkam.ca">KatKam.ca</a>:</p>

<p>That camera is about one block from my apartment. What else is new. Well, I'm still feeling a bit under the weather in terms of my health. Tomorrow is a little party at work, followed by hanging out with <a href="http://audihertz.net/blog">John</a> and <a href="http://miss604.com">Rebecca</a> for a while. A I haven't pulled my camera out really for a few weeks, so I'm looking forward to snapping a few photos before I rust from lack of use.</p>
<p>Sunday I may try to sort things out around home, pay some bills, and finally get XP running on my iMac at home. Should be a busy weekend.</p>
