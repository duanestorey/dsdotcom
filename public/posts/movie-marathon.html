            <p>7:36pm - So John and Brennen just arrived for the Friday night nerd-a-thon. We're debating what movies to watch right now while waiting for pizza to arrive. We have a big list of geeky movies here, some of which are on HD-DVD. Right now the short runners are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Matrix in HD</li>
<li>Dark City</li>
<li>Gladiator</li>
<li>Desperado</li>
<li>Heat</li>
<li>Ocean's Thirteen in HD</li>
</ul>
<p>So we'll see how it goes. Jeff will probably show up in a bit, and I'm not sure who else. I'm guessing The Matrix will be first just to kick everything off with a bag of kick-ass. My copy of Dark City has seen better days, so I'm trying to rip it to my laptop and reburn it before putting into my HD-DVD player, since it's rather flaky and doesn't like scratched discs.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/retrocactus/2167982184/in/photostream/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2136/2167982184_12423da9ea.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></a> Photo of downtown from my place. Taken by John Biehler.</p>
<p>9:11pm Dustin just showed up and sneakily fumbled around in the kitchen putting some chips in a bowl, thinking we couldn't hear him.</p>
<p>Brennen wonders why the Oracle is a chubby, smoking, aunt jemima lookin, cookie-baking bitch of a software program. Who's the brainiac he wrote that code?</p>
<p>10:09pm - The Matrix just finished. We're all totally full on pizza and pop. Saying hi to Dustin for the first time since he arrived mid stream there. Gonna take a short break and then pop in Dark City.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/2168251762/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2244/2168251762_77e68369e9.jpg?v=0&quot;" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>10:51pm - Still Dark City.. I did a quick google to see why Refus Sewell's one eye looks a bit different, but I couldn't find out any info. Looks sort of like the same fracture I had. A couple yawns are showing up in the weak here, so we might have to do another caffeine infusion shortly.</p>
<p><img src="images/darkcity.jpg" alt="" /> A scene from Dark City. Photo from <a href="http://www.paulkienitz.net/comix/darkcity.jpg">here</a>.</p>
<p>12:16am - Brennen just took the stinkiest poop imaginable, and the whole place just reeks. I've been trying to eat Nibs, but everything I eat tastes like poo right now, so I'm gonna hold off. Desperado just went into the DVD player. I'd bring my camera out, but I'm afraid it might corrode due to the fumes coming from the bathroom.</p>
<p>2:18am - Desperado is done.. Most of the group had to work tomorrow AM, so we called it a night.. not much of a full marathon, but it was fun nonetheless. Tomorrow I have to go get a new bank card so I can have money again and probably do some errands. Not sure what's up tomorrow night.</p>
