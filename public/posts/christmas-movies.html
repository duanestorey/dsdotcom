            <p>So tonight Jeff stopped by for some nachos and to watch a Christmas movie. Well, its not exactly your typical Christmas Movie, but I like to watch Die Hard at least once a season, since it technically has some Christmas music in it. I wish they made movies like that nowadays. The last good action movie with the same spirit was probably True Lies, but everything else just takes itself a little too seriously.</p>

<p>On another note, I have an appointment tomorrow morning to get the stitches on my face out. I've had these steri-strips across my cheek since the operation, and last night I decided to take a look just how bad the damage is. It doesn't look as bad as I originally thought, but I'm definitely going to have a nice scar under my eye now. It's going to be nice to have the bandages off so I can shower like a normal person again. I still have almost no feeling on the left side of my face (except it feels cold for some reason, even though it's numb). It's actually really annoying, blowing your nose and only feeling half of it. Hopefully those nerve endings hurry up and regenerate.</p>
