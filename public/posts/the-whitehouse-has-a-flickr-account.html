            <p>I accidentally stumbled across <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/">the official Whitehouse Flickr account</a> tonight, and was pretty enthralled by some of the photos in the account. First thing that's cool is that the Whitehouse even has a Flickr account. Second thing to take note of is that the photos are licensed with a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en">creative commons attribution license</a>, so basically you're free to use them in both commercial and non-commercial settings as long as you do proper attribution.</p>
<p>I've always liked looking at candid photos from other presidencies. For whatever reason, I took a fascination with those from Kennedy's administration, probably because there were a lot of family moments with him, and moments between him and his brother.</p>
<p>Here are a few shots from the Whitehouse stream that I think are particularly awesome:</p>

<p>And my personal favourite, a shot of Obama looking at a portrait of Kennedy:</p>
