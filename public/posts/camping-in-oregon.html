                <p>This morning I woke up and decided to make some plans. Strangely enough, that line from Shawshank Redemption kept going through my head -- "get busy living, or get busy dying. You god damn right."</p>
<p>Anyways, it also didn't help matters that <a href="http://mezzoblue.com">Dave and Lauren</a> took off the other day, as well as <a href="http://www.netchick.ca">Tanya</a> and <a href="http://gusdigital.com/2009/07/camping-quick-update/">Gus</a>. Even Dale left yesterday to go do some relaxing at a cottage. So Instead of just heading south without a plan (something I've done many times before and been burned for), I decided to call a few campgrounds first.</p>
<p>Thankfully the little KOA right outside of Portland had one tenting spot available, so I made a reservation and then started to pack my car. Unfortunately for me, someone was moving in at the time, so I had to carry about six loads of camping gear down four flights of stairs to my car. It was actually pretty tiring. Afterwards I swung by my sister's house and left her my keys, hoping that she'll somehow make it over there every few days or so to water my plants.</p>

<p>I'm currently in Cascade Locks, Oregon hanging out on a little patio at the campground here. I have six beer waiting for me back at my tent, along with some chips and some firewood. So, I'm just going to have a chill night by the fire, and wait until the morning to think about what I'm going to do while I'm down here.</p>
