                Someone pointed out to me that my blog looks a bit stupid in Internet Explorer (IE). So, if you're using IE, and my website sucks more than usual, that's why. I'll attempt to repair the IE CSS at some point, but until then, do yourself a favour and switch to Firefox.
Based on my weblog, 56% of the people are using Firefox (yay!) and 32% are using IE (boo!). A few of you wild, crazy people are even using a version of Netscape.

                Last night, Neil, Ken and I started the evening down at Earl's on Robson street. They had some good martini specials, and even though I don't like martinis, I managed to down one before I was forced to switch to beers. After we were slightly drunk, we made our way up to Doolins for another drink, and then I headed over to the Morrisey with Tiffany and her friend Jenn. I had a really great time hanging out with them, and we finished the night with three jumbo things of poutine down at Fritz on Da...

                I remember I was complaining a while ago that September was going to be a brutal month, and that I'd be glad when it was all over.. I hardly even realized we were into October until today (shows how little attention I pay to dates), but I guess that means I'm in the clear. This is a pretty relaxed month in terms of things going on for me (which is a nice change), but November more than makes up for it (a stag, a wedding reception, and a trip to Mexico are the highlights next month).

                An update from spaceweather:
HARVEST MOON: Tonight's full moon has a special name--the "Harvest Moon." It is the full moon closest to the northern autumnal equinox. Long ago, before electric lights, farmers relied on the Harvest Moon to light up their fields at night, allowing them to harvest autumn crops even after sunset.
The Harvest Moon of 2006 is a big one--almost 12% wider than some full Moons we've seen earlier this year. Why? Because the Moon is near perigee, the side of the Moon's lopsi...

                After watching Clay kick some ass at the Marine Club the other night, I decided to go home and wipe the dust off of my guitars and play a bit.. It's funny -- I used to play all the time, but for some reason I rarely pick them up anymore.. I think part of the reason is that I just don't like either of my guitars. My acoustic was just a cheap piece of garbage I picked up in Chilliwack when I was about 20 years old (it's not bad to take camping, since you really don't care what happens to it), and ...

I'm eagerly waiting for season 5 to come out on DVD so I can kiss another full weekend goodbye watching it.

I woke up at like noon, with the sounds of birds chirping and the fresh air blowing through my apartment (ok, maybe no birds were chirping, but you get the idea).

It disrupts REM sleep, making you feel tired in the morning
It increases cortisol, making you feel stressed out
It distrupts the body's glucose system, increasing insulin levels by as much as 50%
It makes weight loss difficult since the body can't burn fat with high levels of insulin i...

                Why is it that hairdressers just can't follow simple instructions? How does "just a little off the top" translate into "shave my head bald?" I just don't get it. I've been trying to grow my hair a bit longer for like six months now, and yet whenever I go in to clean the sides up a bit, they always chop like a full inch off the top, even though they always promise not to.
It doesn't start that way either, which is what I don't get. The hairdresser always says "yeah, don't worry, I'll just take a ...

I left work to go to Chilliwack and be with him in the hospital. He's doing really well, and is mostly just bored now. They're going to take him to New Westminster in the next few days to do an Angiogram and see what he looks like inside. Everyone is confident he's going to make a complete recovery, so that'...

You can definitely tell that summer is basically over, and that autumn is slowly putting its claws into Vancouver. To be honest, I'm actually glad. I love that feeling you get in the fall when you walk outside and get the cold, crisp air in your lungs. Or crawling into bed late and night when your sheets are a bit cold. Even sitting in front of the fireplace with a plate of nachos watching a movie.

Once we got to the airport they informed us that our 6:30pm flight would be cancelled, but there was one at 7:30pm we could catch.

                When I was back in Chilliwack last weekend, I had this strange urge to play tennis. I used to play like ten years ago with Jeff, Landy and Michele, but I had no idea where my old raquet was. So, I went down to Cottonwood Mall and picked up a new raquet and some tennis balls. After hitting the ball against the wall for about 20 minutes, I realized that it wasn't as fun as I had hoped it would be.
The funny thing is that right after I got back into Vancouver, I talked to Jason and he was asking me...

                When I was driving back from the Rocky Mountains, I was thinking about where I would go for my next trip. New York was awesome, and so was Banff and Lake Louise, but I spent so much time travelling that it wasn't really very relaxing (still very rewarding, but they are different things). So, I decided my next vacation should probably involve less travelling, and more relaxing.
Thankfully, my roommate and friend from first year university, Robert May, is getting married in November in Mexico. So,...

It can still make calls, but the LCD is hooped, so I can't use the contact list or get text messages or anything. I'm pretty amazed actually that it managed to survive at all. I calculated a few properties of the fall:

                So there's this buzz amongst photographers about this new technique called HDR (high dynamic range). The basic idea is that a camera isn't capable of capturing nearly as much dynamic range as what our eyes can capture.? With HDR, you take multiple shots of the same scene using a digital camera on a tripod, and create a new photograph using the information from all the shots. That new image contains a much larger dynamic range than would be possible using any one shot.
Here are some cool examples...

The first thing I hate is that the battery is always dead. It doesn't matter how often I charge it, or how much care I take in shutting it off when I'm not using it, it always seems to be almost dead whenever I pick it up to do anything. Part of my morning routine involve...

I really wasn't looking forward to the nearly ten hour drive to get back, especially considering that I have to work again in the morning.

I can honestly say that Central Park was the one part of New York I wasn't prepared to see. Here in Vancouver, we talk about Stanley Park like it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. And don't get me wrong, it is beautifu...

                Unfortunately, the night before I left for New York City turned out to be a gong show. Mark, Donovan, Chris and myself went out to the bar for a few drinks, but we didn't stop until around 2am. I figured, no problem right -- I still have 4 hours to sleep and pack before leaving for the airport. Needless to say, Friday morning was really rough, and I was completely exhausted and hungover.
What made it worse is that our plane was broken. After 30 minutes of waiting past of scheduled boarding time,...

                I had one of those days where I just felt completely blah all day - I was tired, I had a migraine, and I didn't feel like eating anything. By the evening, I could hardly think because of the pounding in my head. I eventually caved in and took a Tylenol-3 after the four of five regular tylenol didn't do fuck all during the day. When I was a kid I used to get really bad headaches every few days.. Nobody really could figure it out, and thankfully they eventually died down. But as a kid, I spent lot...

It's been a long year, and I'm definitely a bit burnt out and cranky lately. The last vacation I took was last summer, and I wasted all two weeks of it working 12 hour days on my thesis. Come to think of it, the last *real* vacation I had was probably camping down the Oregon coast for a week a few years ago.

It's probably a pretty dumb thing to do, since I don't drive very often, especially now that it's warm out. But I was in one of my "hey, I'm a guy and I need to buy a gadget from time to time" moods, so I picked it up.

There was the hyper-G work done on chickens, for example, by
Arthur Hamilton ("Milt") Smith in the 1970s.  Milt Smith was a gravity
specialist at the University of California at Davis who wanted to find
out what would happen to humans if they lived in greater-than-normal
G-forces.  Naturally, he experimented on animals, and he decided that

                I used to be such a big fan of the Transformers back in the 80s. I religiously watched the cartoon show every afternoon after school, I owned about 50% of all the toys (which I stupidly sold for about $50 one summer to fund my arcade game playing). Now, there's a new movie coming to the big screen about these guys -- I hope it doesn't suck too bad.
Here's a little teaser trailer for it:

I remember that I had to drink about two water for every beer, just to keep hydrated in that heat. Now by comparison, Vancouver is pretty tame on Canada day.

Well, I got back from Chilliwack a few hours ago, and have just been lounging on the couch since then. I had a great time in the wack -- I spent Saturday night at my sister's house, playing with my neice and nephew, and watching a couple of movies. In the morning, we all headed over to my dad's house to watch him open a few presents. Afterwards, dad, Cathy and I went over to Frank's house for a nice BBQ.
I'm pretty happy that I finally got to wash and vacuum my car this weekend.. There's nothin...

Take this morning for example -- up at 6am, even though I typically don't get into work until 9:30am. So, I've just been killing time on the computer, reading articles, taking a few photos, and working a bit on my thesis defense presentation.

                I was just reading that Sony has finally come out with a digital SLR of their own. At first I kind of scoffed at it, thinking that nobody really uses Sony these days (seems like everywhere I go someone has a Canon or Nikon SLR). However, reading the specs, it seems pretty impressive. I like the idea of putting the image stabilization in the camera body instead of on the lens. Canon charges quite a bit for the IS versions of several of its lenses, so it's nice to know that Sony is a little smarte...

I couldn't believe what amazing scenes I was seeing, even though it was completely computer generated. It makes a typical Hollywood look so dismal in comparison.

                About 18 months ago, I picked up the Canon EOS 20D to replace my dying Canon Powershot camera. Stepping up from a point and shoot to a digital SLR was a pretty big step for me at the time, since I had never even really used an SLR camera before. I made a rookie mistake when I got it, and instead of buying a nice lens to go onto it, I picked up a cheap Sigma zoom lens. I spent the first few weeks completely disappointed with my camera, thinking that my point and shoot pictures were nearly as good...

                I picked up a new cell phone the other day -- the Samsung a920. This thing is pretty cool because it has a build in mp3 player, and a 1.3 MP digital camera. The best part is that it's possible to post the photos right from the digital camera into my flickr account, so I can take photos on the fly and have them show up on my blog. Pretty cool if you ask me. Here's a sample shot taken of my desk at work (yeah I know I need to clean it). I haven't figured out how to make it send the original image ...

                So, I've recently had a revelation about technology. Walking around Vancouver, I've been amazed at how much our society depends on technology. Computers, cell phones, MP3 players, iPods, TVs, DVDs.. These things are all great. But as I walked around Vancouver yesterday I realized one thing: we have all this great technology to help us, but none of it %*(&amp;# works.
I woke up in the morning and decided to go for a short walk and listen to some music. I left my apartment, and then proceeded to w...

                Well, I took a day off from CounterPath today to get caught up on sleep, and to catch up on all my errands. I spent the morning doing my taxes, and then had a nice lunch on Granville Island with my mom and Marty. After lunch, I headed back to my place via the little ferry, put on my walking shoes, and went for a long walk. I'm about half way through cooking up a nice BBQ chicken, and then I think I'm going to head to the gym. All in all, it's been a very relaxing day..
I also started thinking ab...

                Well, after nearly three weeks, I'm finally back home.. I left April 14th for Tokyo, Japan, bounced through Vancouver on April 24th, landed in San Francisco on April 25th, and finally arrived in Vancouver late last night.. Man am I tired.. But wow, what an amazing trip. I have never been off the continent before, and it was really amazing going to a completely different place, both geographically and culturally. Thankfully, I don't have any trips planned, since I'm completely exhausted.. But who...

                Well, Dragos, Cheung and I did some serious customer support down in the bay area for the last 8 days.. All in all, it was a pretty good trip, but it was 12 - 14 hour days pretty much the whole time, which didn't leave much room for relaxing.
