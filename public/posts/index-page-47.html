                For the past few months, I really haven't been sleeping that well. Typically that means I sleep in a little later than normal, and am always pushing it getting to work on time. On a lot of days that usually means I end up taking a cab to work. So over the last few months, I've gotten to understand a lot of what makes a good cab driver in Vancouver. Here's a brief list of five must-have things that most Vancouver cab drivers have:

First, you have to have a vehicle that failed some inspection at ...

                This is one of the most tragic things I've read in a very long time. Shoppers at a WalMart were so eager to get through the doors for today's sale that they literally stomped one of the workers there to death. Even while he was down, people still trampled past him, with nobody stopping to help him up or make sure he was ok. Another worker also hit the ground, as did a pregnant lady.
I really have to question what type of world we live in where something like that can happen. It's one thing at a ...

                I had some of the weirdest dreams that I can remember in a long time last night. I went to bed at 10:30pm last night because I was so bagged, so maybe that has something to do with it.
I dreamt that I had to fly out to Timmins, Ontario this morning because I had to be in court. Some guy from high school was suing me for something and (despite both living here) the court date somehow ended up in Timmins. I bought a new suit for the event, but unfortunately I left it on the floor of the hotel room...

When I was in the hospital last year with pneumonia, I ended up getting it, and it was a very nasty experience that took three rounds of antibiotics to get rid of.

I went with the intention of not only abstaining from eating crappy, unhealthy food, but also for drinking booze. I did fairly well on both fronts, and basically shadowed everyone around all night. We ended up at the Morrisey in Vancouver, and just chilled out there for a while.
Near the end of the night, when most people from work had left, my friend Derek and I were just chilling out and thinking...
