<p>Getting down to the wire!</p>
<p>Yesterday I was talking about my trip to some family members, and came to the realization that I'm only a week away from starting it. Truthfully, it's starting to sink in now, and I find myself split between feeling excited and feeling a bit nervous. Excited, because I have a great opportunity to see some of the world and make some new friends along the way. Nervous, because I hate flying and challenging traveling situations. But, I'm approaching this whole trip with an open mind, so I'll just roll with whatever punches come my way.</p>
<p>I've said most of my goodbyes to friends already, and will wait until next weekend to say them to family members. I don't really like goodbyes, so I'll just roll with "see you guys soon". In all likelihood I'll be gone for a full year, but if a cheap flight comes up next summer, I may bounce back home for a week and do a bit of visiting, but we'll see.</p>
<p>In terms of things left to prepare for, here's what's left, in rough order of when I'll have to do them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do a final clean of my car prior to storage</li>
<li>Forward my mail for a few last minute items</li>
<li>Write a few letters to cancel the remaining items (house insurance, etc).</li>
<li>Final loads of laundry and packing</li>
<li>Say a few "see you soons" around here</li>
<li>Pack one suitcase and one carry-on bag</li>
<li>Book my transportation from the airport in Buenos Aires to downtown</li>
<li>Last trip to the storage locker</li>
<li>Pick up some cash from the bank</li>
<li>Park my car and finish getting it ready for storage (fuel stabilizer, remove battery, etc).</li>
<li>Head to Vancouver and check-in to a hotel for a few days</li>
<li>Board a plane for South America</li>
</ul>
<p>So, not very much left to do at all. South America, here I come!</p>
