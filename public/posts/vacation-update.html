                <p>In a perfect world, I'd already be on vacation. But since we have a few client commitments that have taken a bit longer than expected, I'm still working away. My original plan was to maybe go camping for a few days this upcoming week, but that doesn't seem likely right now. But hopefully by mid week I'll be in vacation mode, and will be taking a few weeks of downtime (I'll still be doing a few client related projects during this time period, but those don't encompass more than a few days a week). I'm hoping to also finish off my new theme for this site, and possibly uprev a few plugins.</p>
<p>I've also done some major changes to Crossroads, and have a really cool idea I might try to implement this month as well. But we'll see.</p>
