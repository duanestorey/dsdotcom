                <p>Well, in exactly 12 hours I'll be getting on a plane and heading to Calgary for the 2008 Canadian Juno Awards. I haven't really had time to get excited or to even think about what I'm going to do for three days in Calgary.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/2386683312/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3142/2386683312_e5ff6f7ff5.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>I picked up a few new clothes today, including that fun black shirt I'm wearing in the photo. All my camera equipment is charging in the other room, and I'm slowly adding stuff to a suitcase (and having a hard time deciding how big of a suitcase to bring).</p>
<p>I'm heading over to <a href="http://miss604.com">Miss604's</a> house in a sec for some quick Thai food, and to borrow some podcasting equipment from <a href="http://johnbollwitt.com">John</a>, who unfortunately isn't feeling well. I actually really feel like having a beer for some reason, so I might stop and pick one up on the way over. Part of me feels like I'm on vacation I guess.</p>
<p>This weekend will go fast, and I really have no idea how it will unfold. I'm assuming the role of photographer, writer, and possibly interviewer, which is a bold effort for one lone Chilliwack guy. Thankfully there will be a few Vancouver people out that way, and I have lots of friends with great technical know-how back home here to help me out if I get in a bind.</p>
<p>In terms of following what's going on, here's where you can keep track:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/2008-juno-awards">My 2008 Canadian Juno Awards</a> page</li>
<li><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/duanestorey">My Flickr Photos</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/duanestorey">My Twitter Feed</a></li>
<li><a href="http://junos.urbanvancouver.com">The Urban Vancouver Juno Aggregator</a></li>
<li><a href="http://duanestorey.blip.tv/">My Blip.Tv page</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The aggregator is a good bet if you're looking for information, since it has most of the above links sucked into it. But, feel free to add me on Twitter or whatever if you want to keep up to date in real-time.</p>
<p>The next post I do will most likely be around 6am at Vancouver International Airport tomorrow. It's sort of a tradition of mine to have breakfast at the Milestone's over there. Thanks to everyone who has lent a hand this week - I'll try and give proper thanks as the weekend rolls out.</p>
