                <p>My camera is a digital SLR, and by default captures color instead of black and white images. That being said, once and a while I do take the odd photo that I think would work well as a black and white photograph.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/3299074229/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3476/3299074229_33bebc2733.jpg?v=0" alt="Golden Gate Bridge" /></a></p>
<p>I actually converted this photo into a black and white, but didn't really think that much of it. After uploading it to Flickr though, it became one of my most popular photos -- currently 43 people have indicated it's one of their favorites. Based on the response, I ended up printing out a copy for myself and put it on my wall at home.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the image has a square aspect ratio (the width is the same as the height) -- another unusual framing style for me.</p>
