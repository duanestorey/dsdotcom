            <p>In just a few days I'll be leaving for the city of Buenos Aires again. As people who read this blog know, I started off this great travel adventure of mine last year in that very city. At the time I was a pretty green traveler, and struggled with the language and figuring out how the city worked for the first month or so of my trip. I was frustrated a few times, and a little disheartened with how hard it was at first to meet people. But I eventually overcame most of those obstacles, and probably grew as a person in the process.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ars.jpg"><img src="images/ars-800x597.jpg" alt="" title="Palermo, Buenos Aires" /></a></p>
<p>When my three months were up in Argentina, I was looking forward to heading to New York and to Ireland. But I really enjoyed my time in Argentina, the people I met, and the culture I got to experience. Over the last year or so I've come to realize that I actually miss the city, the people and the lifestyle.</p>
<p>So I'm doing something now that I really have never done before - I'm heading back to a destination for a second visit.</p>
<p>I am definitely using my experience of the trip last time to make some changes for this trip.</p>
<p>First, I purposefully decided not to bring any nice camera gear last trip, thinking that it would just be a burden in my bag and one more item for people to steal. But I missed out on some really amazing photo opportunities in Argentina, and regretted that decision. As camera equipment is expensive in Argentina, I couldn't really go out and buy the gear I wanted at the time. So this trip I'm bringing a pile of my better camera gear, and am really looking forward to photographing the beauty of Buenos Aires and the people there.</p>
<p>Second, I'm bringing more clothes. It sounds like a simple thing, but I assumed on my last trip I would mostly be backpacking around Argentina and basically just brought a few shirts and jeans and thought that would be enough. I really didn't foresee the type of nightlife that was in Buenos Aires, or the different types of social activities I would find myself in (and unfortunately typically underdressed for). So this time I'm packing to live there instead of backpack there.</p>
<p>Third, I'm hoping to get involved in the technology scene there a bit more if possible. While I haven't figured it out yet, I'm hoping to give a talk somewhere in the city about WordPress or the Mobile Web.</p>
<p>And lastly, I'm bringing a guitar this time. I ended up having some time in the evenings to kill in Buenos Aires last time, and mostly I just walked around listening to music or reading books. But most of the time I really missed having a guitar around to play during those moments. I went out and looked at some guitars in Buenos Aires, thinking I might buy a cheap one, but I couldn't find anything I liked so I just decided to go without. This time I'll be bringing my Larrivee, which should make the trip down a little more interesting (I'm a bit paranoid about the process of traveling with it, having heard many horror stories of broken and lost guitars).</p>
<p>When I set out last year on my first trip, people said to me I would probably be a completely different person when I came back. I didn't really think that was possible at the time, but when I was packing my bag the other night it really did dawn on me how much things have changed, both for me and for these types of experiences.</p>
<p>I definitely am far more confident as a person, probably because of some of the challenges I've overcome this last year. I also have met many amazing people, most of which I'm happy to call my friends now, and that's one of the greatest aspects of travel for me.</p>
<p>Whenever you give someone that final hug goodbye in a foreign city, you are never quite sure if or when you will get to see them again. So I decided to make it a point going forward to try and make sure to stay in touch with the friends that I've met around the world, and part of that is heading back a second time to see everyone again in Buenos Aires.</p>
