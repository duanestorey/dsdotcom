                <p>I left Vancouver yesterday afternoon to head into Chilliwack and pick up the keys to my new apartment. On the way, I stopped and met a really old friend of mine from high-school, and we had a few beers and a plate of nachos. I have to say, it was a rather strange feeling being in my apartment all alone after the landlord left. I sort of just stared around at the empty apartment, trying to digest just how I felt. Without a doubt, I am excited. I am definitely looking forward to what the next year or two will bring, and to enjoying life at a slower pace for a while.</p>
<p>I spent the night at my dad's house, then returned to my apartment this morning to coordinate furniture deliveries as well as TV and internet installation. My apartment actually has a patch-panel on the wall, so I can reroute internet or cable at will between rooms and various jacks, which is pretty cool. My brother in law, Andie, came by today and helped me (i.e. did most of it) set up my new bar stools and my dining room table. I had to leave before everything was assembled, but my brother in law offered to do the rest before I returned on Sunday, so I'm looking forward to seeing it all together.</p>
<p>Tonight I'm going out with some friends to celebrate Rebecca's birthday for a few hours. Then I'll probably come home and continue packing. Sunday is the big move, and I still have a lot to do before then. Also, tomorrow is my last day at my current job. Since I've been there for five years, I'm not really sure how I'll feel as the day winds down. Work is throwing me a going away bash, complete with free beers, in the late afternoon, so that should be a lot of fun. I'll post more sometime on the weekend, hopefully once I have a bit more packing done.</p>
