                <p>I'm going to have to spend some time going through all my friends' previous posts about the Olympics, because truthfully, I really have no idea where any cool events or things to see or do are, other than the actual events. It sounds like there are a lot of international houses that are worth visiting, as well as a few pubs (although based on some of the Tweets, the prices seem rather incredible for beer, even by Vancouver standards).</p>
<p>As it stands, I have a few events to attend next week already. There's a party/event on Robson I've been invited to, which I may swing by and check out. There's also a Molson tasting for the new Rickard's Dark which I'm hoping to attend as well next week. I have a few other emails to go through, but I imagine the evenings next week will fill up fairly quickly. I also want to set aside a pile of time to just walk around and soak everything in with my camera. I'm hoping I can meet up with a few friends and do a few photowalks around the city if time allows.</p>
<p>Right now I'm planning on being in Vancouver either Friday night sometime, or at the latest on Saturday. I'm debating leaving my car in Chilliwack and simply taking the bus in. If I'm going to be in Vancouver for a week or so, having my car doesn't really make sense, and will probably only end up being a completely pain with all the traffic. But I'm still undecided.</p>
<p>Can anyone else recommend any cool events to see or do next week? I'll browse around and make my own list, but if you have any ideas drop me a line.</p>
