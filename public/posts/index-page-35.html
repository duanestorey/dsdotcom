                Last night I had the choice of staying up at my campsite, which was all set up, or staying in my nice air-conditioned apartment. Given how gross it was outside, I actually decided to stay here and get a good night's sleep. So this morning I had to wake up, do an hour long client call, and the head up to the lake and tear my campground down, which is thankfully all complete now.
So I'm back at home, and definitely looking forward to a semi-normal weekend around the house. The last few weekends ha...

                So, I don't want to be known as a party pooper, but as I was sitting here in my bed, looking at live web cams of Vancouver's Celebration of Light, it suddenly occurred to me that shooting off fireworks into the sky when there's essentially a province wide fire ban on doesn't strike me as a particularly bright idea.

Sure, it brings people together. And I understand not only the amount of planning that goes into the event, but also how hard they would be to postpone or call off. But it seems stra...

Second, I've decided to change my diet in the short term to see if I can find a food trigger. Pretty much the only time I've felt normal again for a period of time was actually when I was in Cancun in March. For basically a whole week, my stomach problems ...

                I gotta say, this week has been fairly insane in terms of heat. Given that I live inland now, it's been a few degrees warming than in Vancouver. The other day, while camping, the humidex hit 45C up at the lake, which is actually hotter than the hottest day I experienced back in Ottawa when I lived there (which was 43C). Let me tell you, it's hot.

                Yes, that's all I've become. I wake up, I go outside, my plants get mad at me, and I spend the morning watering them and looking after them.
For those who are just joining the saga, I planted a few tomato plants on my patio at the end of May. I've watched them grow, seen them fall down a few times, nursed them back to health, and in return, I've been rewarded by the growth of a pile of little tiny tomatoes.

One of the challenges with growing fruits and vegetables on your patio is that it's real...

I tried to stay at work as long as I could, but after a while my hands were shaking so bad I could hardly function at my job, so I went home.
I curled into bed, and wrapped my duvet as tightly as it would go around myself. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't stop shivering. I ended up eventually falling asleep, and slept mo...

Other than that, I spent most of today sitting shirtless on my picnic table, trying hard not to melt in today's heat. Thankfully I was in the shade most of the day, but man oh man, when that sun hit it sure was hot.

As I pointed out, checking in was an hour long process, made longer by a few people who for some reason thought they were privileged campers. Unfortunately I was stuck in a wireless hole, so I wasn't able to take the call at 8am where I was supposed to be on the radio.
I'm going to be camping up there for three days, off and on, so I thought I'd write a few camping related en...

But given how I have four bars on my phone, and that 3G is working great, I might just work from up here.

I went with Rebecca and John back to their place, and we got there probably close to 7am or so. While everyone was totally fried, there was brief talk about watching a movie for a while to help the brain ramp back down to sleep mode. I laid down on the couch then, and woke up a few hours later to some of the sounds of downtown Vancouver.

The official Blogathon website shows approximately $40,000 raised for the various charities this weekend, which is totally awesome. Of that amount, approximately $1,250 was raised by the content on this blog, and by the people who supported my efforts and the BC Children's Hospital Foundation.

It was a place we raced through on the highway, en route to the Okanagan, or to get back to Vancouver. We plugged our noses as we gagged on the cloying, ever-present stench of cow manure. We snickered at the tacky billboards all the way in and out of the Fraser Valley. We made jokes about inbreeding. We c...
