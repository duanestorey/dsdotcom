            <p>Today I had a specialist appointment to fully quantify the damage to my vision from my accident last year. The appointment was about an hour of waiting in the waiting room, twiddling my thumbs, and an hour of experiments. They were forced to dilate my eyes, which means not only am I totally sensitive to light right now, but I'm having a very hard time reading anything.</p>

<p>Not sure the verdict, but it's looking pretty likely that my double vision in my upgaze is probably permanent. I can potentially compensate for this by changing my eyeglass prescription to have a slight upward taper in the lens, but since it doesn't really interfere with my job, I'm ok for now I guess. While another surgery might be able to fix everything, I was told that at this point there is nearly as much risk as there is potential reward, so it's something I'll have to think about (assuming it's even my call at all). Honestly, I'm not sure if I'm bummed out or relieved that this point.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing again later tonight. I think I might go kill a few brain cells tonight to celebrate.</p>
