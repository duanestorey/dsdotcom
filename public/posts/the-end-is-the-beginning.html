            <p>I haven't slept that much lately. In San Francisco the sun would rise around 6am and wake me up. Normally I'd be ok simply falling back asleep, but that just hasn't been working lately. Surprisingly though, I haven't been tired. If anything, I've found myself a lot more energetic than usual. For example, this morning I woke up at 7am and decided to go to the gym. It was a bit tough, given that I hadn't had any real food yet, but I felt pretty awesome when it was over, especially considering I started my work day at my usual time and had already got some exercise in. I think I'm going to try making that my standard routine, at least for the next little while.</p>
<p>I also went out this evening and whacked a few tennis balls around. I used to actually be on the tennis team back in high-school, but I haven't really played in years. It was actually pretty weird being out on the same court I used to practice on when I was 18, and sort of made me feel like I was in high school again to be honest. Even weirder was that I walked by my old friend's house and heard his mom hanging out in the back yard. It was a pretty surreal experience to be honest. I'm hoping to get out a few times a week and see if I can get back into playing a bit more tennis. I'm pretty sure I have a few friends in town here that play.</p>

<p>I did a bit of thinking on the plane ride home from San Francisco and decided to change a few things up. Except for a few events I've already committed to (currently a boat cruise in Vancouver on the 9th, and a weekend getaway in Victoria on the 19th - 21st I believe), I think I'm going to take a little break from the Vancouver tech scene. I like hanging out with everyone, but the cumulative effect of driving into the city to attend them all tends to tire me out. And truthfully, I'm really enjoying hanging out at home these days, and want to spend a few more evenings and weekends just relaxing near home. I'm hoping to finally finish unpacking this weekend, and should have a spare room (completely with bed) set up sometime in the next week or so.</p>

<p>Given that the weather has been so fantastic out here lately, I've been thinking about mixing my schedule up a bit during the weeks. I might do some work in the morning, and take some of the afternoon off to go outside and enjoy the weather. I typically find it easier to get work done in the evenings when there aren't a lot of distractions, so I might do sort of a split shift. I'm also debating hopping in my car this weekend and maybe going camping somewhere if the weather holds (it looks like it's supposed to be pretty awesome).</p>
