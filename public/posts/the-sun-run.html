                <p>In 2004, some friends and I got together and decided we would attempt to do the Vancouver Sun Run. We started our "training" that January, first doing little tiny runs around the block, then eventually moving up to hour long runs along the water in Steveston, or through the University Endowment Lands (which is an amazing place to run).</p>
<p>The actual run itself was really fun, but a little too crowded for my liking. I didn't expect to have a very good time, but after training for four months, I really wanted to see just how good I could get -- unfortunately, I was sidestepping people for the first 30 minutes, which didn't make for a very enjoyable run or a very good time (that's my excuse at least).</p>
<p>I found out on Friday that our office is putting a corporate team together. After a big of hagglng, I once again found myself signed up to do the 10km run. Some of the people in the office are going to walk it, which is fine, but I'd really like to take a shot at running it again. Which basically means I gotta get my butt in gear and start running. I did a small 20 minute one on Friday, and that didn't kill me. But I basically need to add 10 minutes a week until the day of the run is here.</p>
<p>So, if anyone else wants to go for a really pathetic run during the next month or so, drop me a line. I'm right beside the seawall, and it's always fun running around it.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday was a superbowl party at Neil's house. Here are some photos from the event.</p>
<p>I also cleaned up my links and blogroll.</p>
