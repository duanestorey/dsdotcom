                <p>I've been playing around with Google Adwords a bit, experimenting with a few basic campaigns to figure out how it all works. I was partly inspired by a friend of mine who drove some traffic to his retail store here in Chilliwack using a Facebook Ad campaign over Christmas.</p>
<p>The part that I don't really understand is how Adwords is a good investment at the CPC prices they charge? For example, I was trying to target Vancouver Stock Photography using an adwords campaign. After playing around with a few keyword combinations, it quickly became obvious that the average CPC for something that targeted was between $1.50 and $2 a click. Sure, if you just put something generic up there the CPC usually goes down. But that means you'll have a lot of people on your site that aren't entirely interested in what you have to offer, especially if you're a niche market.</p>
<p>So if you assume CPC of $2/click, and maybe a 10% conversion on people that actually hit your site, that means you need to make at least $20 profit/sale on Internet visitors from your ad campaign to break even. If your margin is 50%, that basically means you have to be selling at least $40 items to make it work, or at least selling a combination of products that amounts to greater than $40.</p>
<p>So it seems like Adwords and other CPC advertising campaigns aren't really suitable for cheaper products, not unless you have an amazingly high conversion rate.</p>
<p>Anyone with experience using Facebook Ads or Google Adwords have any comments?</p>
