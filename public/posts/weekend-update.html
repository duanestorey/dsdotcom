                <p>Last night I ventured across the water and ended up down at Dave's house in North Vancouver. It was good times, complete with an amazing BBQ, some rum, and a bunch of tech talk. I didn't really feel like hiking to the bus stop at 1am to head home, so Dave let me crash in his guest room.</p>
<p>The one thing about having a huge chunk of plastic under your eye is that you can really tell when your body is a bit dehydrated. For example, right now my left eye is really sore and I have a mild burning sensation, which usually happens when I'm dehydrated, or when I've had a few drinks. Obviously that kind of sucks, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>Tonight I'm going to head home and start packing for the big trip. I have sort of a bittersweet love for traveling. While I like seeing new things and ending up in exotic, warm destinations, I don't like airports, airplanes, or some of the stress that comes with hotel bookings, car rentals, and neighborhoods you don't know. Thankfully on this trip I'm meeting up with people at every step of the way, so it should be a fairly good time.</p>
<p>I'll probably swing by the mall tonight and buy a bunch of new clothes. I really don't have any shorts of summer-type clothes these days, and considering it's 90-100F in California, I figure now's a good time to stock up. Being that it's pay day for me today, I can happily shop without feeling any guilt.</p>
<p>I'll probably drop a quick blog entry this weekend before I hit the airport, but in case I don't, I'll definitely keep everyone up to date with San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>
