                For whatever reason, I didn't end up falling asleep until around 4am last night. Obviously waking up this morning after about four hours of sleep was pretty crappy. I'm out of cream at home so I meandered my way down to one of my two favorite coffee shops and set up shop.
Unfortunately, I forgot my wallet and my cell phone at home (at least I'm hoping my wallet is at home). Thankfully I had a few bucks worth of change in my pocket so I could order a coffee. The problem with lack of sleep is that...

                One of the best parts about living in Chilliwack is finally being able to hang out with my niece and nephew once and a while. I managed to make it down to Jessica's gymnastics performance this afternoon, which was cool.

I also snagged a pretty cute shot of a little Jelly Bean girl waiting to start rolling her ball.

                Just a quick question to the photography crowd out there. Does anyone have any experience selling photos on microstock websites? A couple of people have asked me if I've ever put any photographs on microstock sites. I haven't, mainly because I feel pretty strange selling photos for 50 cents each. Truthfully though, most of my photos sit there collecting dust anyways and don't make any money, so I was just curious if there's enough volume on those sites to turn over any non-trivial cash-flow.

I've been using Twitter for a long time now, and the one universal constant in that time period has been the flakiness of the Twitter service. Even today, at least a year after some of these problems started cropping up, you still get the occasional "Fail Whale" when the servers can't keep up. Some of the other random problems I've witnessed lately are:

disappearing avatars
the inability to upload a new avatar
missing background images on profiles

                As most people already know, I am a big fan of camping. I'm not really sure why to be honest, but there's something about being in the wilderness with nothing but a bit of nylon between you and the outdoors that I've always found appealing. Maybe it started years ago when my dad and I used to crash out in his camper when I was a kid. Maybe it was all those trips I did with Brennen and Jeff in the old days. Needless to say, it's one of the things about summer I always look forward to.

John was asked to setup for a live radio broadcast out at a winery, and unfortunately Rebecca couldn't go with him. So, being the amazingly awesome friend that I am, I packed up my camera and hopped into John's company's mini-cooper.
It was a leisurely four hour drive from Chilliwack out to Osoyoos, and John and I just listened to music and got caught up. We basically just sat around...

Ah yes, in what is probably one of the most documented penis measuring contests in recorded history, Ashton Kutcher has quickly vaulted his way up to 1,000,000 followers.
For whatever reason, Twitter seems to have disabled the unfollow/follow button his account, so people can't unfollow him. Thankfully, the Twitter API has a solution to this problem. If you want to unfollow Ashton, try the following:

You would think if you care about someone you would at least have the decency to do it in person.
