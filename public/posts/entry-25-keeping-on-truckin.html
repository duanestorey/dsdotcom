                <p>Well, ladies and gents, we just passed the halfway mark over here. I have to say, writing 24 blog entries has turned out to be more difficult than I imagined. I managed to close my eyes for a few minutes there are recharge my batteries slightly, but I'm currently in this weird groggy limbo that is making it hard to write anything.</p>
<p>For those of you arriving here on the day shift, welcome. Please browse the pages and visit all 24 entries so far. As you know, I am doing this 24 blogging marathon to support the Union Gospel Mission. If you are a reader and wouldn't mind supporting their cause, then please head on over to lend some support. The only way these blogathons are a success is if we're able to raise some money for charities such as the Union Gospel Misson.</p>
<p>I'm once again going to be on the lookout for exciting articles to post about. If you see or read anything, please feel free to pass it my way.</p>
<p>This entry was written for <a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/tag/blogathon">Blogathon 2008</a>, and in support of the <a href="http://ugm.ca">Union Gospel Mission</a> charity. If you'd like to donate to the cause, please visit <a href="http://miss604.com/blogathon">the blogathon donation page</a> and fill out the form near the middle.
