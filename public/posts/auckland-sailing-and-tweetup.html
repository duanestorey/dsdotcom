<p>I'm only in Auckland until the end of the month, but I have a pretty busy schedule until then. This weekend I start sailing lessons with the <a href="http://www.pennywhiting.com/">Penny Whiting</a> sailing school. It looks like there are about 8 people in our group, so it should be a fun experience. I've already received some introductory material, so I'll spend the next few evenings going over it to get ready for the course on Saturday.</p>
<p>One of the items we were told is that we're not allowed to wear any non-white soles on the sailboat. That gave me a good excuse to go out and buy a new pair of Adidas casual shoes (a nice change from sandals). So I'm doing my best to break them in before the weekend.</p>
<p>I also got selected to be a part of a private Tweet-up organized by Air New Zealand on the <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10764704">first 787 to arrive in the southern hemisphere</a>. I haven't received all the details yet, but I suspect a small group of us will head down to the airport on Monday and spend a few hours checking it out.</p>
<p>There's still quite a bit left of Auckland to see, so hopefully I manage to find some time to slot it all in. At the end of the month I'll be checking out of my apartment here and will be taking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlander_(train)">The Overlander</a>, which is a 12 hour train ride down to Wellington. I've been told Wellington is more artsy and trendy than Auckland, so it'll be an interesting change.</p>
