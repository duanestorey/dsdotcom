                <p>As I mentioned in my last post, I somehow managed to lose my glasses at Honey on my birthday night. Since I only had them for two days, I was obviously a bit bummed about what happened to them. However, both Brennen and Hesty suggested I call my Visa company (since I used my Visa to do the purchase) and see if there is anything they can do.</p>
<p>So surprisingly, my Visa policy actually has a clause that covers loss or damage for any new item for a period of 90 days. What that means is that they are going to give me a full refund on the purchase price.</p>
<p>I just called the optometry place and put in an order for a new pair. Should be here at the end of next week. I'm actually really glad this worked out, because I was a tad bit bummed about the whole thing. Being out $600 for a pair of glasses isn't really a good way to ring in a new decade.</p>
