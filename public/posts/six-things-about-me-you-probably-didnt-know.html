                <p><a href="http://www.tracy-lee.com">Tracy</a> tagged me in a blog post, so I thought I'd better step up and deliver. So without further ado, here are six things you probably don't know about me (and most likely, didn't want to know about me).</p>
<ol>
<li>I have a queen sized bed, but only own one pillow. It makes sleeping strange. 2) I drink way too much diet pepsi, and usually have an empty bottle somewhere in every room 3) I typically buy the same thing whenever I'm at the store. That explains why I have four jars of salsa in my fridge, three tubs of vitamin E cream in my bathroom, and a freezer full of ground beef. 4) I type over 100 WPM normally. 5) Despite being able to solve problems in my head fairly quickly, I have a hard time organizing physical things. I can literally spend an hour cleaning my room, only to have it look exactly the same afterwards. That's one of the reaosns I pay cleaners to come every two weeks. 6) I sleep about four or five hours a night on average (not by choice). I also sleep better with a warm body next to me, but really, who doesn't?</li>
