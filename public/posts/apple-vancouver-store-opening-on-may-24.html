To be honest, it comes as a fairly big surprise given the state they were in last month (based on rumours). Obviously I think it's a pretty cool thing that they are opening this weekend.</p>

<p>Considering that many of the rumour sites are alluding to big announcements from Apple on June 9th at the developer conference, I can't help but think the construction of the Vancouver store was accelerated for some of those reasons. In particular, I expect we will see the new 3G iPhone at the Vancouver store sometime in June, and I suspect something along those lines will be announced at the developer conference.</p>
