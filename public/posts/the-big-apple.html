                <p>Well, I made it. I'm sitting in the hostel near central park, trying to upload a few photos to flickr using this crazy setup they have here.. I got a few there, although the quality sucks.</p>
<p>Lots of delays yesterday leaving Vancouver. Apparently our plane was busted, so they were frantically trying to replace some parts on it so we could take off - not a very good start to a trip, especially for someone that doesn't like flying. We landed at JFK about 1.5 hours late. Thankfully I met a nice lady on the plane who offered to pay for my cab down to times square (she could expense it she said). So, about 60 minutes after landing, I stepped out of a cab and saw New York in all her glory. It's a really great city, and the people here are very friendly. I spent most of today walking around Lower Manhattan. Visiting ground zero was surreal, and it was actually pretty sad standing there thinking about all those people that died. I also saw the Brooklyn Bridge, the Statue of Liberty and Grand Central station. Tomorrow I'll spend my time near midtown.</p>
