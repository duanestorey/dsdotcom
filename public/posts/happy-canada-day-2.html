<p>Whenever I think of Canada Day, I am always reminded of the few years I spent in Ottawa. Out there, Canada day is a day-long party, where they basically shut the downtown core down and let everyone mingle, get their face painted, and for those of you of legal drinking age, have a few street-side beer. At the end of the night there was always a big concert on Parliament Hill.</p>

<p>So by comparison, Canada Day in Vancouver is pretty tame. Last year I got together with some friends and had a few pints in various locations around the downtown core. This year, I don't really have any plans, but will probably sneak out at some point and take a few photos.</p>
<p>For all of you heading out to enjoy some friends and partake in some events, have a great Canada Day. Happy Birthday Canada!</p>
