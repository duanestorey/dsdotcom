They had some good martini specials, and even though I don't like martinis, I managed to down one before I was forced to switch to beers. After we were slightly drunk, we made our way up to Doolins for another drink, and then I headed over to the Morrisey with Tiffany and her friend Jenn.

                I remember I was complaining a while ago that September was going to be a brutal month, and that I'd be glad when it was all over.. I hardly even realized we were into October until today (shows how little attention I pay to dates), but I guess that means I'm in the clear. This is a pretty relaxed month in terms of things going on for me (which is a nice change), but November more than makes up for it (a stag, a wedding reception, and a trip to Mexico are the highlights next month).

                An update from spaceweather:
HARVEST MOON: Tonight's full moon has a special name--the "Harvest Moon." It is the full moon closest to the northern autumnal equinox. Long ago, before electric lights, farmers relied on the Harvest Moon to light up their fields at night, allowing them to harvest autumn crops even after sunset.
The Harvest Moon of 2006 is a big one--almost 12% wider than some full Moons we've seen earlier this year. Why? Because the Moon is near perigee, the side of the Moon's lopsi...

It's funny -- I used to play all the time, but for some reason I rarely pick them up anymore.. I think part of the reason is that I just don't like either of my guitars. My acoustic was just a cheap piece of garbage I picked up in Chilliwack when I was about 20 years old (it's not bad to take camping, since you really don't care what happens to it), and ...

It disrupts REM sleep, making you feel tired in the morning
It increases cortisol, making you feel stressed out
It distrupts the body's glucose system, increasing insulin levels by as much as 50%
It makes weight loss difficult since the body can't burn fat with high levels of insulin i...
