                I used to be such a big fan of the Transformers back in the 80s. I religiously watched the cartoon show every afternoon after school, I owned about 50% of all the toys (which I stupidly sold for about $50 one summer to fund my arcade game playing). Now, there's a new movie coming to the big screen about these guys -- I hope it doesn't suck too bad.
Here's a little teaser trailer for it:

                My last Canada day in Ottawa, my friends and I woke up around 10am in the morning, and started drinking our first few beers. That day, we ended up sitting in 43C weather on the rooftop of the Hard Rock Cafe in the Byward Market. I remember that I had to drink about two water for every beer, just to keep hydrated in that heat. Now by comparison, Vancouver is pretty tame on Canada day.
