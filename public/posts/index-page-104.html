                Last week, Tiffany invited me out to join her and Hanh for some karaoke down at the (yeah, that's right) the legion. It actually wasn't as bad as I thought, although the beer line was insanely long. Once we figured out how to 'shorten' the line, it was a far better evening. I didn't get up the guts to go sing anything crazy, but maybe next time. Afterwards, Derek and I went to Tiffany's place for an hour or so. Here's a shot of me, right before I ate her budgie.

                Well, on Friday night Cole and Lexi came over for a sleep over. We hung out at my place, and then went down to Granville Cinemas to see Over the Hedge. I have to say, that's the one saving grace for movies these days -- that the animated shows still have heart and soul. I couldn't believe what amazing scenes I was seeing, even though it was completely computer generated. It makes a typical Hollywood look so dismal in comparison. Here's a shot of Lexi hanging out at my place.

                So, this weekend I decided to leave the city life behind and join my dad and Cathy for a few days in the wilderness down south.? The destination was a little place along the ocean called Fort Casey, near Deception Pass, Washington.? I had a great time, consuming an ample amount of alcoholic beverages, and sitting by the fire.
Unfortunately, the one major downside to travelling to the United States is having to go through customs on both sides.? No matter how many times I cross, or how many stamp...

                About 18 months ago, I picked up the Canon EOS 20D to replace my dying Canon Powershot camera. Stepping up from a point and shoot to a digital SLR was a pretty big step for me at the time, since I had never even really used an SLR camera before. I made a rookie mistake when I got it, and instead of buying a nice lens to go onto it, I picked up a cheap Sigma zoom lens. I spent the first few weeks completely disappointed with my camera, thinking that my point and shoot pictures were nearly as good...

                Well, the whole no-drinking-for-thirty-days effort came to a crashing halt late last night as Derek, Chris, Alex, Dustin and myself managed to get ourselves pretty wrecked.? It started as a simple "just one drink, it won't kill you," and finished sometime around 4am as I passed out on the couch.? The good news is that I didn't break from low carbing, so I should still be on track.
I think the whole no-drinking effort was fundamentally flawed from the start.? That being said, I'm going to try and...

After visiting mom and baba, I went with Amanda, Andie and the kids to Cultus Lake to relax near the water for a while. Cultus Lake is easily my favourite campground in North America.

But as I walked around Vancouver yesterday I realized one thing: we have all this great technology to help us, but none of it %*(&amp;# works.
