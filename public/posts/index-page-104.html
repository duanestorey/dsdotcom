                    While I was reading about the "science" behind Superman tonight, I found this article on chickens. Funny.
There was the hyper-G work done on chickens, for example, by
Arthur Hamilton ("Milt") Smith in the 1970s.  Milt Smith was a gravity
specialist at the University of California at Davis who wanted to find
out what would happen to humans if they lived in greater-than-normal
G-forces.  Naturally, he experimented on animals, and he decided that
the animal that most closely resembled man for this specific purpose
was the chicken.  Chickens, after all, had a posture similar to man's:
they walked ...

                    I used to be such a big fan of the Transformers back in the 80s. I religiously watched the cartoon show every afternoon after school, I owned about 50% of all the toys (which I stupidly sold for about $50 one summer to fund my arcade game playing). Now, there's a new movie coming to the big screen about these guys -- I hope it doesn't suck too bad.
Here's a little teaser trailer for it:

                    My last Canada day in Ottawa, my friends and I woke up around 10am in the morning, and started drinking our first few beers. That day, we ended up sitting in 43C weather on the rooftop of the Hard Rock Cafe in the Byward Market. I remember that I had to drink about two water for every beer, just to keep hydrated in that heat. Now by comparison, Vancouver is pretty tame on Canada day. This one will be even worse, since everyone is preoccupied watching the world cup (which I have to say, looks pretty sweet in high definition at my place). However, a bunch of us are still going to brave today's heat, ...

The guys from CounterPath took me out for a few free rounds of drinking last night. We started at Nevermind in Kits for a few beers after my defense. Then Des and I went for dinner on Granville Island (Bridges) and met up with everyone at 8pm for some drinks at the Yaletown Brew Pub.

It seems like only yesterday the wheels of the 737 came off the ground at the Ottawa airport, and I was heading back home to Vancouver to pick up my old life, and start a master's degree in EE. And here am I, 11pm, only a few hours to go before it's all over. It's weird looking back on things like this.. I remember starting school again, thinking it would be so much different from my undergrad, only to realize that after a few classes, nothing really had changed -- it was the same boring lectures and crap.

I think I'm going to pull a steak out of the freezer, sit on the patio and relax for a few hours.. This is going to be a pretty awesome week. If all goes well, this Tuesday will be my last day as a student, and I'll be able to put my whole graduate experience behind me. I'll probably go for a few drinks that night, but I'm more excited about the big pub crawl on Saturday. Some friends and I are going to hit the streets of downtown ...

It was pretty hard to get into most pubs, so we had to settle for a few lesser known places.. We started laying the groundwork for a wicked Canada day pub crawl on Sat. Should be great!
Also, Dustin show me this crazy ass video from a Norweigen band that uses kitchen appliances for their instruments.. This stuff is pretty messed:

I have to say that the highlights for the night were the jugglers and the flipping guys.. It was also really cool to hang out with some of the people that I started university with in 1995 (it was our UBC reunion night... )
Today I woke up and headed over to Dustin and Dori's house to hang out for a few hours.. We walked around and enjoyed some of Kits Day, and then came back to Dustin's (where I am now) for some early-afternoon ...

However, I'm averaging a between 200 - 400 unique visitors a month that aren't web crawlers, but only about 2 or 3 of you are commenting. So my question is, who are the rest of you!?

I'd rather do some weird acrobatic maneuver with a pool cue than admit defeat and use the granny. So when it comes to photography, I can probably count the number of times I've used a tripod in my life on one hand. That being said, I read once that the difference between a good photo and a great photo is a tripod. ...

Well, I got back from Chilliwack a few hours ago, and have just been lounging on the couch since then. I had a great time in the wack -- I spent Saturday night at my sister's house, playing with my neice and nephew, and watching a couple of movies. In the morning, we all headed over to my dad's house to watch him open a few presents. Afterwards, dad, Cathy and I went over to Frank's house for a nice BBQ.
I'm pretty happy that I finally got to wash and vacuum my car this weekend.. There's nothing worse than having a new car that's caked in mud and dust. There's not much new going on. I have to ...

My Thesis
I'm off to Chilliwack now for a BBQ with my sister, and then spending the day with my dad tomorrow. I'm taking the big dog (the 20D) so hopefully I should come back with some great photos of cows or drunk people.

                    I haven't been sleeping very good lately, and as a result, I tend to be awake at weird hours.. Take this morning for example -- up at 6am, even though I typically don't get into work until 9:30am. So, I've just been killing time on the computer, reading articles, taking a few photos, and working a bit on my thesis defense presentation. It's funny because even though I consider myself a night person, I always like getting up at this hour -- it makes your day seem so much more productive for some reason.
Here's a shot off my patio a few minutes ago:

                    First off, I met with my supervisor tonight to finalize my thesis.. Although I don't have an official answer yet, it's very likely I'll be giving my defense next Thursday.. That's really soon, and I have a lot of work to do before then, but the good news is then I'm completely done before I go on vacation, which would be pretty awesome.. There will definitely be booze 'a flowin 'a plenty Thursday night if I pull it off. On Friday I'm going to Cirque de Soleil, so I hope that my defense is Thursday so I can go out and get sloshed.
On another note, I found the best way ever to make shitty coffee, ...

                    I really wish I had some really great things to write about. But the truth is, I didn't really get up to much this weekend. I've been working on a pretty cool project at work, so I spent most of Friday night trying to lay the groundwork for it (yeah I know, real cool way to spend a Friday night, but oh well). Saturday night we went down the Global/Afterglow for Kate's sister's birthday party. That was a pretty fun time, even though the drinks were ridiculously overpriced (Derek's martini was $15). I'm not really sure why, but I've been a bit bummed out lately. I've been trying to get some sunlight ...

                    I was just reading that Sony has finally come out with a digital SLR of their own. At first I kind of scoffed at it, thinking that nobody really uses Sony these days (seems like everywhere I go someone has a Canon or Nikon SLR). However, reading the specs, it seems pretty impressive. I like the idea of putting the image stabilization in the camera body instead of on the lens. Canon charges quite a bit for the IS versions of several of its lenses, so it's nice to know that Sony is a little smarter in this area. I'm not sure what the price point is for this new SLR, but it might be fun to check ...
