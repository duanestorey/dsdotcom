                <p>Tomorrow I'll be packing up and making the long journey back home. Truthfully, I'd probably rather leave tonight if that were at all possible -- not because I'm not having fun here, but mostly because tomorrow is just going to involve sitting around and killing time before our flight.</p>
<p>I fly out of San Francisco in the early evening, and will land in Seattle sometime around 9pm. From there, we have to find my car and drive back to downtown Vancouver so I can drop Rebecca and John off at home. While they've offered me up their couch for the night, I'm looking forward to hitting my own bed, and will most likely just carry on straight to Chilliwack. With any luck I'll be in my own bed sometime around 2am tomorrow.</p>
<p>I've been really fortunate in my life that I've had many opportunities to travel. I'm finding though that as I get older I'm more and more of a home body. Sure, seeing new things is always exciting, but so is spending a weekend at home tinkering around or hauling my BBQ up to the lake for a nice steak dinner.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, since moving back home I've had far more invites to Vancouver and social-media related events. While that's obviously great, I've been having a hard time striking a balance between attending those events and turning them down to just relax at home. There's at least one Vancouver event a week coming up until July, and while I'd love to attend them all, I'm going to have to probably bail on a few of them just to keep my sanity. I'll think about that a bit more this week, but truthfully I'd like to spend the next few weekends at home.</p>
<p>I'm still on track to probably take most of July off. I don't really have any major plans for that month, but I'm hoping to do few impromptu road trips or possibly even some hiking trips that month. I've also stumbled across some of my old sports gear, namely my tennis, badminton and squash racquets, so I might try whacking a few balls or birdies around soon. I'm also going to try to start getting up earlier in the morning and going to the gym before I start work. Given that I'm not really a morning person, I suspect that will be difficult, but it's worth a shot.</p>
<p>Tonight I'm just laying low in the hotel room here in San Francisco, and am just going to watch a movie and then get some sleep. I have to kill a bit of time tomorrow, so I might find a coffee shop with Wi-Fi and do some work. Other than that I have 45 minutes of subways, two hours of flying, and about 4.5 hours of driving to do tomorrow. Until then.</p>
