                <p>I just got back from quickly picking up my fixed <a href="http://www.photoxels.com/canon-sd630.html">Canon SD630 camera</a>. Apparently the warp-core phase-inverter was out of alignment, so I had to get that readjusted to the tune of $160. Seriously, those guys can turn any small problem into a huge one that can cost lots of money. I was originally told the shutter door was broken, which seemed somewhat reasonable (I pictured a really small, weak hinge breaking). However, now it's more along the lines of the "shutter solenoid ring was hosed." How does a shutter solenoid ring break? Better question, what the hell is a shutter solenoid ring anyways? Apparently it broke because I dropped it (which was an amazing leap of faith by the guy when I originally dropped it off, since he made that statement before I even described the problem), but I don't remember dropping it. And even if I did, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoid">solenoid is just a few loops of wire</a>, so it really doesn't seem that breakable. Oh well.</p>
<p>I pity the people who don't understand anything about cars or technology -- they must get hosed even more than I do.</p>
