                <p>I'm sitting in a hotel room, in Calgary, lying in bed in my boxers, eating some nachos that were delivered via room service. That, people, is how I rang in my 31st birthday tonight. There were lots of parties going on in Calgary, but truth is I just wanted to relax, watch some TV, and reflect on another year.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/2394553241/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2101/2394553241_cb73139a08.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>I actually had the perfect photo to put up here for this entry. It was a shot of me with a bunch of other photographers at the Junos, all hanging out with Russell Peters after the awards. I thought it would be a fun shot, and would sort of sum up this weekend for me in a photo. But when I approached the photographer who took it and asked for a copy, he turned me down.</p>
<p>I'd be lying if I said that event didn't bum me out a bit, because it did. But ultimately it just made me thankful that I am the person I am, and that the world I normally live in doesn't contain any people like that.</p>
<p>But in terms of birthdays, it's funny how fast time flies. Some days I wake up, and for a brief moment, think that I'm somewhere else. Some other time, some other place. Like when a summer breeze takes you back to a bike ride as a kid, or the sound of the surf to the thoughts of an old vacation. A creaking floorboard that reminds you of footsteps that once walked there. The traffic lights streaking across the room at night, like memories of dancing candlelights.</p>
<p>I never really knew my great grandmother. Because my family is Ukrainian, and our grandma is known as Baba, everyone got used to calling my great grandmother "Baba Grandma", which I guess the adults figured would confuse us kids less. Before she died, years ago, she had a conversation with my dad, one that he still talks about today. She told him that every day she woke up and felt like she was a 16 year old girl again, a girl that loved to play with dolls, run through the fields, and play outside with her friends. It was only her reflection in the mirror that gave her age away.</p>
<p>I have so much to be thankful for. I have great friends, loving family, and the person I've become in my 31 years is someone that I'm proud of. While I'm not perfect, I do the best with what I have, I admit when I make mistakes, and I try to move two steps forward for every one I fall back. And despite the bumps in the road, especially over the last year and a half, I really have been blessed with good fortune my whole life. I mean, here I am, a computer dork, at the Juno awards taking photographs. It's a rare opportunity, and I'm really thankful that good forture has blown in my direction more often than not in my life.</p>
<p>The next year will be different that the last two. It will be a year without surgeries and without hospitals. It will be the year where I move past the ugliness of the past and restart the engine that stalled a few years ago. And in that regard, I'm really looking forward to it. Part of me feels like it's a chance to start over again, to put things right that somehow went wrong, to make new friends, and to have a little fun along the way.</p>
<p>I have a plane to catch in the morning, so I'll leave it as that. But I just want to thank all my friends and my family for being there for me during the last thirty one years.</p>
<p>Also, as an added birthday present, Google is featuring the last plugin I wrote, <a href="http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordpress-without-borders/">Wordpress Without Borders</a>, over on <a href="http://google-code-featured.blogspot.com/">their coding blog</a>.
