                The more research that's published, the more evidence I seem to run into that indicates insulin resistance (and consequently obesity) seems to be related to oxidative stress and/or nutritional deficiencies. As I've pointed out before, one of the strange paradoxes that most theories generally can't explain is why obesity often goes hand in hand with poor nutrition. That is, if obesity is caused solely by overeating, then we should see the lack of obesity in populations where food is scarce or nut...

                After leaving Koh Tao, I took the ferry back to Koh Samui and boarded a Bangkok Airways flight for Krabi. Krabi is a little town on the west coast of Thailand, and one of two gateways over to the Phi Phi Islands (the other being Phuket). Given the distance between the two locations, I couldn't find another way to get to Koh Phi Phi in one day, other than to fly to Krabi instead of bus. So that's what I ended up doing.
The ferry was late getting back to Koh Samui, and even though I had pre-booked...

They give you a 20 minute window where you need to wait in front of your hotel, and eventually a shuttlebus picks you up and takes you down to the ferry.

Food is amazingly cheap, the people are super friendly, and in general Thailand is really laid back and accommodating. While the weather has been mostly cloudy lately, it's still warm by North American standards, and a daily dip in the pool has become part of my routine.

Sure enough, not only is it easy, but tailors in Thailand are extremely prevalent.
