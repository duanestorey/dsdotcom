                    So that stupid opacity problem has finally pissed me off enough to start to do something about it. There has to be a bug in my theme somewhere that's doing it, but I haven't been able to pinpoint it exactly. For now I'm switching to this theme, even thought it's a bit buggy too (it's only temporary)..
Actually, after disabling my theme and all plugins, the problem still exists in other themes.. I've only noticed it on my mac using Camino or Firefox, so I wonder if there's something wrong there.. I don't see the problem on a PC. Grr...

                    Yesterday after work I was thinking to myself that I have never seen Vancouver from up high really, except for on Grouse Mountain late at night. I've been up the CN Tower in Toronto and the Empire State Building and Rockafeller Center in NYC, but never up in the harbour center. So, last night I grabbed my camera and went to check out what Vancouver looks like at night. ...

                    So as most of you already know, in less than two weeks time, I'm going to be turning 30. No, I will not be starting any fires in Vancouver with the heat from my birthday cake, but I will be drinking no doubt in some bar somewhere with some of my friends. 30 is a really a strange birthday. As I approach it, I'm not really sad about it, but I am aware of the weight of it. I think it makes you look back on a pretty important chapter of your life and evaluate where you were, where you are, and hopefully where you're still going. As Kris said a few weeks ago over beers, "a decade will do that to you."

                    A few weeks ago, I started reading over craigslist and frequenting a few of the online dating sites I used to go to in the past. A few emails have been passed around, and some of those have ultimately lead into online conversations via IM. What bothers me the most is that there's this trend where people initiate a chat with you, and then are either too busy or too uninterested to spend time chatting. For example, this one girl will always IM me whenever she sees me and ask to chat. So I say sure.. Then, I spend 5 - 10 minutes waiting around for her one or two word response to every essay I write. ...

                    I'm pretty bagged, so this will be short. The flight leaving Heathrow was pretty much a complete clusterfuck. Apparently they were out of gates, so they just parked the 747 on the concrete a mile away and had to shuttle us all there in small groups.. We took off around an hour late.. About an hour into it, we had some pretty wicked turbulence, which for someone who hates flying basically unnerved me.
I popped a few sleeping pills when we hit altitude and managed to sleep for most of the flight home (surprisingly, because I had an aisle seat, and nobody asked me to get up so they could go to the ...

                    I approximately 24 hours, I'll be stepping off a plane at Heathrow and rushing madly to see some of London before my connecting flight to Vancouver leaves in the early evening. I think I'll probably only have about 3 and a half hours to see London, which I'm sure doesn't give me much time to see very much. With the time constraints, it looks like I'm gonna shell out $100 for the express train that goes from the airport to Paddington Station near central London. From there, I'm really not sure what I'm going to do. It still seems like quite a haul to get to any of the attractions, so I imagine ...

Afterwards, we sort of started our own mini pub crawl, checking out a few of the bars in the Oulu downtown. I really love the architecture over here.

I decided in that time I would throw a few photos up from yesterday (I don't have that many). Oulu is pretty quaint so far, and I'm actually really eager to walk around and see some things (since the architecture looks really cool from my hotel window). I have to be on-site around 9 this morning (which means I need to get back to sleep), but afterwards I think my hosts are all taking me for dinner.

When I lived in Ottawa, there were times when I used to get a little homesick and miss Vancouver and Chilliwack. When that happened, I was fortunate enough to stumble across a little website called KatKam.ca. It's a live webcam that points into the direction of the evening sunset, only a block or so away from my apartment in Vancouver. To this day, I always religiously check it out from time to time when I'm out of town, just to see what I'm missing back home.
Here's a shot of the sunset tonight that I missed. I'm heading to the airport now to fly up North. See you guys in about a week. ...

So far, I haven't really seen much of this city, although walking around it was really awesome to see the old style buildings and narrow walkways. Someone asked me what the buildings were like, and I stopped myself before saying "they look European" since I guess that's obvious.
Yesterday someone flew down from a little town called Oulu to hang out with me for the day and work on some stuff. One of the things that we discussed was me going up there for a few days, since there are more people up there that understand ...

                    So I have a few minutes to kill here at Heathrow, so I thought I would write a quick blog entry. The flight from Vancouver to here was relatively uneventful.

I haven't slept a wink, so I'm hoping I can sleep for an hour or two on the next flight to Helsinki. I think my next flight is delayed slightly, which means I probably won't get into the hotel until around 10pm or so.

                    Surprisingly, I actually was tired enough to go to bed sometime around 10:30pm Helsinki time last night. The last time I got any real sleep was Friday night back in Vancouver, so after 15 hours of travelling, I was pretty hungry and exhausted. I just didn't have the strength to go find food when I got here, so I popped a couple over the counter sleeping pills and went to sleep.
Unfortunately, although I did sleep pretty well, I was up around 5:30am waiting eagerly for the 6:30am breakfast to start. Having just gotten back from eating, I feel well enough to finally do my first real blog entry out ...

                    So, there are a million things I could say about this week, but I'm just too tired.. It's been long, and I have to get on a plane in less than 24 hours to head to Europe.. It's nearly 15 hours of travelling, and when I get there it will be cold and snowing.
I went out with Derek and Cisco for a few hours tonight, despite being completely bagged. We ended up at Salt in gastown (which is a really wicked wine tasting place). Here's a shot of me tonight.

And here are a few more from the night. Special thanks to Van for lending me his 24-70 f/2.8L for the week in Europe. ...

                    This morning I came into work fully expecting to have a long day and then go home to bed. But it now appears I have to go home, do laundry, and pack for a last minute trip to Finland. Which is cool I guess, since I've never been anywhere in Europe before (which in itself is strange considering how much travelling I've done). It's going to be a work related trip, so I probably won't have too much time to relax, but I'm taking a few days at the end (I hope) to explore a little bit and see what it's like. ...

                    I actually came home with the intention of writing two separate blog entries, but I'm so frickin tired that I'm only gonna be able to get this one out. This is a pretty crazy little time at work right now, and I'm on day two of a pretty hard two week push. Yesterday was a 12 hour day at work, and today was pretty close to 14. By Friday I'm definitely going to be ready for a few drinks (or maybe a long nap).
Anyways. I was chatting wtih my brother-in-law on MSN earlier today, and he let me know that their house was broken into in Chilliwack this morning. The guys made away with most of the expensive ...

                    I'm not sure why, but for some reason the opacity on my blog is messed up. Not always, just sometimes. In random places. I've gone over the CSS with a fine-toothed comb, and it looks fine, so I'm really not sure why it's doing this. I'm gonna spend some time soon to try and fix it, because it's really pissing me off. If you highlight a section of dim code, it automatically becomes bright and stays bright, so there's almost some weird incompatibility going on with something I'm trying to do. It looks fine in Safari, just not anything Mozilla based. ...
