                <p>Well, here we are, at the end of another week. I'm so looking forward to relaxing a bit. There's a show tonight down at the Media Club I might go check out, but I haven't decided yet. Other than that, I'm probably going to stay close to home and get caught up on rest. December will probably be filled with lots of Christmas type things and a few parties, so I'm going to do my best not to wear myself down this month, considering I'm still on antibiotics. Good news is I saw a guy this morning who knows his stuff, and he said I should be fine and is gonna mix things up again. So in theory I should be completely over everything in a week or two.</p>
<p>I've been working on a new theme for my blog. It's a dark background theme instead of white, and I know a bunch of you hate that, but for some reason I want to mix things up a bit. I have a cool idea for my header, but it involves photoshop working for me, and right now my copy is pooched. I'm thinking about only have my latest entry on my main page, and just having links to the other ones, or doing some Ajax transition between entries. Still thinking about it. But I want to do something that looks slightly different.</p>
<p>I should be close to home most of the weekend, so drop me a line if you're in my hood.</p>
<p>Also, you really need to head over immediately and <a href="http://www.maniacworld.com/Crayon-Physics-Deluxe.html">check this out.</a> It's a game that's aware of the real laws of physics (ignore that you can construct hammers and put the rotational point in a cloud for a second), and it's super super cool. Thanks to <a href="http://raymitheminx.com">Raymi</a> for the link.</p>
