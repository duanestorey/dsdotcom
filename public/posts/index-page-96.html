So had an interesting day yesterday. Got lots of stuff done at work, which was good. I love being on a "coding roll" where everything makes sense and falls into place.. Having those hard problems to solve is nice as well, but sometimes it's nice to fall into "brick-laying-mode" where you can just crank out code and feel good about it.

Here's the deal though. This is the *second* A920 I have owned in about 6 months. Granted, the first one breaking was completely my fault, but I'm pretty bummed that it's dead now. I've had cell phones die before, and no matter the circumstances of how they die, the repair guys always come back and say "water damage -- not fixing." And here's my take on it.

For some reason they never included a focus assist lamp for low light conditions. Canon's way around this was the fire the internal flash several times in a row to try and do a focus in low light.
