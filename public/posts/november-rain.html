                <p>I'm heading to a friend's wedding in Seattle in November. I'm actually pretty excited about the trip because it'll be my first real weekend there since 2007. Seattle's one of those cities I always expected to fall in love with, but for whatever reason, just haven't managed to yet. I suspect it's because I don't really know where to go when I'm in the city, but I'll do a bit more research this time around. The last time I was there I stayed at the relatively trendy <a href="http://www.hotelmaxseattle.com/">Hotel Max</a>, which was fairly central and had a decent little lounge.</p>

<p>I was talking to the people at the <a href="http://www.alexishotel.com/">Alexis Hotel</a> in Seattle about my upcoming trip (which is a <a href="http://www.kimptonhotels.com/">Kimpton</a> hotel), and they were more than happy to offer me an amazing deal for their Fireplace Suite for the weekend. I can't say that I've ever stayed in a 750 sq. foot hotel room that has a built in wood burning fireplace, but I'm definitely looking forward to it.</p>
<p>The Alexis Hotel is also <a href="http://www.alexishotel.com/alxspec/index.html">offering a great deal for Canadians looking to get out of the city during the 2010 Olympics</a>. For anyone interested, they are offering 20.10% off of their regular prices during that time. So if you're looking to escape, Seattle might be a great destination for you.</p>
<p>With any luck, I'll also be heading to the Caribbean in late November for two weeks. Not sure on the final destination yet, but Punta Cana is looking fairly likely.</p>
