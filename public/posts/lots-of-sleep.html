            <p>I ended up doing a bunch of work on Saturday night, and just hung out close to home. A quick twitter by me saying I was going to have a few casual drinks at my place led to Dave showing up for a few beers. After that, we went down to the Six Acres to meet up with Trevor, and then ultimately over to Matt's house for a few quick drinks.</p>
<p>When I got home that night, I realized just how tired I was. I passed out on the couch around 4am, and quite literally woke up sometime around 5pm last night. I got up here and there to answer my phone and check email, but I just couldn't force my body to wake up. Last night I put a movie on, and then curled up on the couch with a blanket. About half way through the movie, I turned it off and just closed my eyes on the pillow.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning around 9:30am and hauled my ass into work, but in the last 36 hours or so I must have slept for around 20 hours or so, which is fairly crazy given how little I sleep these days. I'm still a bit groggy today, but my brain almost feels rested, which is good.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the big Molson event down at the brewery, which should be fun. If memory serves me correctly, launch party is sometime this week as well, so I'll probably swing by that. After that, we have the big WordCamp event that Rebecca and I are organizing, and then that's it for a while. Also, on September 24th I have a meeting with Dr. Peter Dolman about doing another surgery. Apparently he's one of the best guys in the province for the type of injury I sustained, so we'll see what he has to say.</p>
