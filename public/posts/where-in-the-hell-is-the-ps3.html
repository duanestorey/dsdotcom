                <p>I remember back around Christmas, Sony announced that they were unable to meet the holiday demand for the PS/3. I suspect part of this may have been artificial, since the resulting huge line-ups across the country showered the company with press everywhere. Unfortunately, those events <a href="http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/390735">lead to the deaths of a few people in incidents that occurred</a> while in the long line-ups in sometimes cold, outdoor conditions.</p>
<p>During that period, I had passively walked into whatever electronics store I could find, and asked if they had a PS/3 for sale. The answer was always no.</p>
<p>So here we are, nearly six months later, and I'm still completely surprised that I can't find a PS/3 in the city. Is it really because the demand is outpacing the supply? I find this hard to believe since nobody I know owns one yet. However, several of my friends own Nintendo Wii's. While I'm not really interested in the PS/3 as a gaming environment, it is still the cheapest Blue-Ray DVD player on the market, and since I'm considering ditching cable altogether, I would really like a DVD player capable of doing high-def (so my high-def TV doesn't sit there getting dusty). Another solution (one which I'm sure Microsoft is kicking themselves in the ass for) is to buy a <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/x/xbox360hddvdplayer/">Xbox 360 external HD DVD player</a>. Apparently, this is just a run-of-the-mill HD DVD player, and every computer on the market will recognize it as such. Unfortunately, getting a software DVD player that does high definition is another challenge entirely, which makes that solution trickier.</p>
<p>If anyone actually knows of anyone with a PS/3, I'd love to know since I've never, ever seen one.</p>
