                <p>Wow, it's only Tuesday, and already we've had quite the week so far at BraveNewCode. Yesterday we pulled the curtain back on a brand new <a href="http://www.visioncritical.com">Vision Critical</a> site. Vision Critical was recently announced as the fastest growing company in British Columbia, and it was a lot of fun working with that team.</p>
<p>Today Dale and I woke up and starting seeing some press about the new mobile versions on WordPress.com. WordPress.com is the free, hosted version of the WordPress platform, and currently has around 5 million blogs or so on it I believe. As of today, the iPhone plugin for WordPress that Dale and I created, <a href="http://www.bravenewcode.com/wptouch">WPtouch</a>, is now live on WordPress.com, and is the default theme for all users viewing the site on an iPhone. That means roughly 60 million page views a month on WordPress.com will feature WPtouch.</p>
<p>That's obviously super cool, and we're pretty excited about it. Thanks to everyone for supporting WPtouch and <a href="http://www.bravenewcode.com">BraveNewCode</a>! Dale and I have a lot of really exciting things on the go right now, so stay tuned for some more excitement.
