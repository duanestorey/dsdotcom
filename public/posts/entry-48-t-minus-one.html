                <p>This is my second last entry, which means Blogathon is almost over. This was was definitely a lot harder for me than the one last year, mainly because I started the event already in a pretty exhausted state. But no matter - the end is near.</p>
<p>I'm sitting on the couch here at Workspace, watching the start of another sunrise. By the time this day is over for me, I will have seen two sunrises, a gorgeous sunset, and even a lightning storm. Not a bad day at the office if I do say so myself.</p>
<p>With everyone's help, we raised approximately $1250 for the BC Children's Hospital Foundation, and for that everyone has my admiration and my thanks.</p>
<p>I have one more entry to go, after which I can pack up and head to the couch at Rebecca's house to try and get some sleep. I'm definitely looking forward to it.</p>
