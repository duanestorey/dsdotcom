                As of October of 2007, Apple has sold approximately 120 million iPods worldwide. At approximately $250 each, that's $30 billion dollars in revenue. It is without a doubt one of Apple's crowning technical achievements, both for the ingenuity of the hardware and for the revolutionary integration with software on several platforms.

And yet lately, as I've trekked the 30 minute walk between my home and work with my iPod blaring away, I've started to wonder what the impact of this technology really ...

I'm heading out to watch this tonight with Rebecca, John and John. Rebecca had tickets to the Vancouver premiere and invited me along, which is totally exciting. I'm going on the record as saying I'm pretty sure this is going to suck (the trailer reminds me of a techy Blair Witch Project), but it'll be a fun suck with a bunch of friends. That sounds dirty, I know.

                I have to ask -- what is it with everyone's obsession to feed each other stuff that's really bad for you? Every day at work is a constant battle of having to tell people you don't want cookies, or chocolate, or donuts. It seems like everywhere I go someone is trying to ram a cookie down my throat.
I like sweets as much as the next guy, but I'm not sure where this fad came from. I really hate having to tell someone "no" ten times. It's fun for the first two, and then it's just super annoying. As ...

These events have typically brought together anywhere from 5 to 50 people, and have usually involved people walking around and snapping shots for an hour or two. They are a lot of fun, and always a great chance for people to improve their skills or just get out and stretch their wings a bit.

While Europe is ahead of North America in this regard, we have slowly been migrating most of our North American television services to digital, and in most cases, HD. I believe the US has a target date of around 2013 to be completely digital.
