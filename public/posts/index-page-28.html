                I'm down here in Punta Cana, drinking a few beers with my friend Dale. I saw on Twitter that my good friend Kasia is expecting her first child, and I wanted to share.

There aren't really too many aspects of my old job I miss, but Kasia is definitely one of them. Despite our best efforts, we haven't been able to meet for lunch or anything since I left my job in January, but hopefully sometime soon. That said, I'm super happy for Kasia and her husband, Rob, on their recent announcement.

                It's hard to believe that I've been down in the Caribbean for 11 days now, but that's how the math works out. I woke up this morning and spent a few moments trying to figure out what day of the week it was, since it's pretty easy to lose track.
Sara made it home ok, and Dale and I have been working on some BraveNewCode stuff since she left. Yesterday we spent most of the day in the room, Dale designing away and me coding away. We're keeping the lid on most of the things we're working on, but lot...

The other night I ventured off the resort and ended up at the Hard Rock cafe in Punta Cana. I met up with a few Vancouverites and we all went to a dance club until about 5am or so in the morning. I stumbled back into my ro...

I was originally gonna stroll down to the gym when I woke up, but slept a bit later than I normally do so I skipped the gym and the morning buffet. I met Dale and Sara by the pool for a few hours of reading, a bit of snack bar love, and then ultimately made it down to the gym for a bit of a mini workout.

Strangely enough, I'm sort of adverse to massive amounts of heat, but for some reason the temperature here seems about perfect. Sure, it gets a bit hot during the day, but nothing a few beers and a dip in the pool can't fix. And in the evenings the temperature drops enough to toss on a pair of jeans and chill in the lobby bar for a few hours.

Shortly after writing my blog posting yesterday, I ended up feeling pretty worse, and went to my room to curl up in bed.
