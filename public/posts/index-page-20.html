                Well, as you can see, I've started making changes to this website. They are far from done, but I think I've made enough headway to put it back up for a while. Here's what I have done so far:

Made a new theme, borrowing a few elements from the "default" wordpress theme
Added a custom flickr plugin that has read/write access to my flickr account
Added the ability to associate abritrary images or sets from flickr with any blog entry. These images can be viewed using the ImageBox javascript library...

Lately I really feel like I'm entering into the next phase of my life. Maybe it's turning 30 soon, or maybe it's all the events that happened over the last few months, but I've spent the last few months trying to figure a...

However, I'm going to make some pretty major changes to it soon. Which means, I'm probably gonna take the site down for a while, probably starting this weekend. I have some pretty big ideas about what I want to do, and I'm not even sure I have the skill set to do them all. S...

Technically, Blue-Ray is superior technology, but HD-DVD is easier to manufacture, and is cheaper to produce. I've been waiting anxiously for a clear winner to emerge to I could finally go buy one of these things. I mean, most of my research at UBC was in the area of high definition, so ...

All you need to do is generate a simple text file that outlines the state transitions, and their "dot" program will output the state machine diagram for you. Pretty nifty.
Here's a simple example I did:

                A new study says people who have full-fat milk gain *less* weight over time. I hate to say I told you so, but I'm not a big believer in the whole "fat makes you fat" belief. I agree saturated fat isn't very good for you, but the other types of fat are. As long as you don't eat the grissle in a steak, over 2/3 of the fat in it is good fat, which is better than most other things. Which gives me an idea for another blog entry later tonight.

                I went out tonight and shot a few photos around town. I wanted to try my hand at making a HDR image. Here's one of the better ones off the Burrard Street Bridge.

Here's one more in roughly the same location.

So had an interesting day yesterday. Got lots of stuff done at work, which was good. I love being on a "coding roll" where everything makes sense and falls into place.. Having those hard problems to solve is nice as well, but sometimes it's nice to fall into "brick-laying-mode" where you can just crank out code and feel good about it.

Here's the deal though. This is the *second* A920 I have owned in about 6 months. Granted, the first one breaking was completely my fault, but I'm pretty bummed that it's dead now. I've had cell phones die before, and no matter the circumstances of how they die, the repair guys always come back and say "water damage -- not fixing." And here's my take on it.

For some reason they never included a focus assist lamp for low light conditions. Canon's way around this was the fire the internal flash several times in a row to try and do a focus in low light.

                I'm such a big fan of Christmas. I don't know why, since most people tend to get a little grumpier, the malls are way busier, traffic is far more hectic -- yet somehow I always tend to get a little happier when my lights are up, or when I see presents under the tree.

The last couple Christmas's have all sort of slipped past me without me really noticing. I guess I was just really busy, but I always found myself in Chilliwack a day or two before Christmas, wondering where i...

                So, on Tuesday, December 5th, 24 Season Five comes out on DVD. I lost a few weeks to my life to the first four seasons, and plan to lose another week to this new season the moment it comes out. I'm pretty excited about it since it's supposed to be a pretty wicked season.

Hopefully they still have a few copies left at Future Shop when I get off of work on Tuesday....

                For those of you who read my blog from time to time, you might remember my write up when I saw Superman Returns in the summer. It was actually not that bad of a movie (my second viewing I didn't think it was as good), and when I got home that weekend, I decided to watch Superman I and II again just to remember what they were like. And I have to say, I really enjoyed them (even though Chris says that makes me gay).

The "slouch" position revealed a reduction in spinal disk height, signifying a high rate of wear and tear on the lowest two spinal levels. Across all measurements, the researchers concluded that the 135-degree position fared the best. As a result, Dr. Bashir and colleagues advise patients to stave off future back problems by correcting their sitting posture and finding a...

Almost all cameras have light meters that are set up to try and make every scene around 18% grey. Some guy a long time ago looked around and realized that almost every real-world scene is made up of midtones, and these midtones are usually in the ballpark of 18%. So, whenever ...

I have a lot of sinus pressure on the left side of my face
I can't look upwards without seeing double vision
My left eye appears slightly sunken compared to my right eye

So, even though my doctor said just to chill out, I decided I'd contact him again today. I had to jump through alot of ho...

                I just got back from quickly picking up my fixed Canon SD630 camera. Apparently the warp-core phase-inverter was out of alignment, so I had to get that readjusted to the tune of $160. Seriously, those guys can turn any small problem into a huge one that can cost lots of money. I was originally told the shutter door was broken, which seemed somewhat reasonable (I pictured a really small, weak hinge breaking). However, now it's more along the lines of the "shutter solenoid ring was hosed." How doe...

A couple cool things happened at the game. My old friend Mike from Ottawa was there (I found out on IM earlier in the day), so Mike and I managed to text msg each other on our phones until we finally found ourselves catching up in front of 32...

                For those of you who live in Vancouver, by now you've heard that there's currently a water ban in effect for certain regions of the GVRD. You can read about this a bit more on Clay's Blog. The actual reason why the water is "bad" is apparently because of turbidity. What this basically means is that there is a lot of sediment in the water, and for some people, this can cause some problems in the toilet department.
What's a bit strange in all this is that there are lots of places in the world wher...

Afterwards, some of us met down at the Nelson St. Cafe. to see some live music. I originally went to see Melanie Dekker, but unfortunately, she played before we got there. However, the music was still pretty good, and I took some photos.

What's sort of interesting is that they had an ultrasound done to find out the baby's sex, and were told it was going to be a boy. So, they got lots of boys clothes, painted the room blue, picked out names, etc. But, at the hospital, they were treated to a baby girl.
I popped by for a while today to see their currently unnamed baby girl. What a cutie.

                So, I have bounced between a couple of ideas for Halloween this year, humming and hawing about what I was going to be. I woke up this morning and realized that I still didn't have a costume. Frantic, I started scanning around my living room for ideas.. And that's when it hit me.. on my floor, in a nice picture frame, was a picture I took in New York back in July.
A picture of the Statue of Liberty.
So, I spent this afternoon putting together a costume of the Statue of Liberty. I made a funky tor...

                I've been getting a lot of notices from Air Canada's Aeroplan recently. Apparently they have changed their policy so that air miles accumulated on airlines actually expire after a period of time. What that means is my airmiles from a long time ago are going to start disappearing off my statement in the near future.
So, I guess the easiest way to get around that is to cash them in sometime in the next 6 months and go somewhere. I don't really have a lot of vacation at work, so I'll probably just ...

                So, yesterday night Cisco and I met up with Cullen at Gotham for dinner. Gotham is arguably Vancouver's finest steakhouse, and despite living here for 10 years or so, I had never been there. Steaks start at around $40, and go up to the $50 Porterhouse that I had. Apparently they cook them in some funky infrared chamber that can cook a steak in around 6 minutes. Anyways, it was fun, but I'm not sure my steak was worth $50.
Afterwards, we met up with Jason, Ecker and Derek for a few drinks. It was...

I cooked a few eggs up last night (hardboiled) so that I'd have a little snack in the fridge when I got hungry. But, unfortunately, cold hard boiled eggs just don't really do it for me. I figured -- why not just warm those puppies back up in the microwave before I eat them? Sounds like a good idea. So, I deshelled them and stuck two eggs in the microwave.
