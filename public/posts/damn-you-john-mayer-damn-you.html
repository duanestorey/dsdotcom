            <p>So, about a month ago I decided that I was going to pull my guitar out of retirement and try to get better at it again. I've been playing for about ten years now, but realistically I only spent about a year or two actively playing it, so I really can't play anything tha complicated. But I decided I'm going to try and get better.</p>
<p>So, I've pulled out all my recent music and have been trying to play it on my guitar. The only problem is most of the stuff I have been listening to is rather tough to play for me on the guitar. Take John Mayer for example. He's a really good guitarist, inspired by greats like Jimi Hendrix. He's really jazzy and bluesy, and his fingers are all over the fretboard most of the time. I have smallish hands, so it's pretty difficult for me to pull out some of the crazy shit he does.</p>
<p>I tried playing this one piece tonight, and my fingers were in some weird twister-like maneuver and I still couldn't get it right. It's a good thing I don't try singing, because that would mess me up even more. I'm determined to play some of his harder stuff though, even if I have to break a few fingers in the process (what's a few more broken bones anyways)?</p>
