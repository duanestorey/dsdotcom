                <p>Yes, I think it's true. HD-DVD, my friends, is dead, or at least in the last of its death throes. Being an early adopter, I went out a few months ago and picked up a HD-DVD player, thinking that at the bare minimum both formats would exist for a year or more. It turns out my timing was rather poor.</p>
<p>A few of the major studios moved from HD-DVD to BluRay last month, and the move was so dramatic that the HD-DVD guys cancelled their talks at the CES show in Vegas (which actually probably did the most harm to their effort). <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAN1451010520080215">Reuter's is reporting that HD-DVD is basically dead</a>, and a leak from WalMart indicates that they are no longer planning to stock HD-DVD in the future.</p>
<p>This is yet another example how corporate greed once again took precedence over consumer satisfaction. While nobody forced me to go out and buy a HD-DVD player, I watched the industry in a virtual stall for years (despite HD TVs being fairly prevalent now), and simply got tired of watching my TV go to waste. Had the two camps resolved their differences a long time ago, most of us would probably have cheap BluRay players in our houses already, and this sour taste in my mouth would never have occurred.</p>
<p>So that's it. Happy trails HD-DVD, it was nice to know you.</p>
