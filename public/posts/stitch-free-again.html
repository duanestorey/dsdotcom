                <p>Well, I got the steri-strips off and the stitches out just a while ago. It actually looks pretty good. There's a small line of dried blood that should come off in the next week or so, but once that's gone I don't think there's gonna to be too much of a scar at all.</p>
<p>Here's a picture taken just a few minutes ago (for those of you interested). Sorry for the stupid angle, and the stupid pose, but it's hard taking self pics.</p>

<p>So, as Hesty would put it, my head is nearly unfucked now. Everything is looking pretty good. My vision is nearly perfect. And I'm going to celebrate with a few beers after work on Friday.</p>
<p>On another note -- Death Cab for Cutie kicks some serious ass. I've been listening to this stuff non-stop since yesterday.</p>
