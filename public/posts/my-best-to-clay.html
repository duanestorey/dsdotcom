                <p>For the last few months, we've all been hearing Clay complain about being out of breath and not being able to walk very far around the office. His general doctor did some tests on him and said there wasn't anything wrong and that he should just move past it.</p>
<p>Eventually Clay got referred to a specialist since things just kept getting worse for him. Turns out he has a blockage in his heart which is why he's having problems. Tomorrow Clay is heading down for an angiogram, and will probably have to get a stent in his heart. My dad had something similar last year, and while the procedure is relatively pain free, I know just how stressful the whole ordeal can be.</p>
<p>All the best Clay, we'll be thinking about you. Give us a shout if you need anything.</p>
