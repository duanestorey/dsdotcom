                <p>Well, I'm exhausted. I can rarely sleep on planes, and this trip was no different. We landed about 20 minutes ago, and all I want to do is curl up in a ball and have a nice sleep, but unfortunately I have to transfer plans in a bit and head to Ottawa. Normally I'd find a chair and try to sleep, but given that my body is about 8 hours behind on sleep now, I don't think it's a good idea to close my eyes, since I probably will sleep right through the boarding call on my plane.</p>
<p>The flight out here was rather uneventful, although I have to say flying in business class kicks some major ass. Not only did I have a pile of room, but my seat had an electric massage thing built in. The guy next to me just happened to be one of the loudest snorers I've ever met in my life, but thankfully Spiderman III was showing and I just zoned him out. My flight leaves here at around 9am (which is about two hours from now), although I might try to grab an earlier one if I can persuade someone.</p>
<p>I'd pull out my camera and take a few photos right now, but I'm too tired to even move my bag around. Once I get to Ottawa, I'm going to check into my hotel and sleep for a few hours, then try to grab a few photos from around downtown.</p>
