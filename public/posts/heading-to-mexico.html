                <p>A few days ago I pulled the trigger on a trip to the Mayan Riviera in Mexico. I'll actually be heading down there with Dale, mostly so we can drink a few beers and also strategize a bit about the next year before I head off on my little adventure.</p>

<p>While we sometimes meet in Hamilton or Chilliwack, it's obviously much nicer to be able to have those kind of meetings around a pool in Mexico with some nachos and beers. And truthfully, it's really not much more money to meet down there: a typical trip to Hamilton during high season probably runs $700-$800 for the flight, plus all the expenses we incur while there. You can pretty much get a week long all inclusive for the same amount, which is basically what we prefer to do.</p>
<p>So, at the start of November I'll be heading to the Bahia Principe Tulum and spending a week by the pool. We always walk away from our trips with a ton of new ideas and big plans (the main ideas around WPtouch Pro came out of the last such trip), so it should be a lot of fun. I'm also looking forward to getting a nice tan so I don't look like some stupid gringo in Argentina!</p>
<p>And on that note, I'm in the process of growing my hair out. I haven't had a big mop on my head since I was probably about 21, so this will be interesting to see what happens. I keep my hair pretty short these days, but when it gets long it's naturally curly, and almost forms little dreads on its own. Not sure what it'll do nowadays, but we'll soon see. I'm also down 14 pounds now since the summer, which means I'm on track to be back to my old university weight prior to leaving for Buenos Aires.</p>
