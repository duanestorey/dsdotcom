                <p>Today is my sister and brother-in-law's 15th wedding anniversary. Hard to believe really, since I vividly remember being at their wedding years ago and doing the chicken dance over and over. It was a nice little wedding, right up at Cultus Lake, in a tiny little community hall that held around 80 people. In true Ukrainian fashion, the bar was completely open (a definite requirement for when I get married -- I'm willing to compromise on everything else, but the bar has to be open).</p>
<p>The wedding photos were across the road and on the edge of the lake. So this afternoon I'm going to be heading up with my camera, and taking a few new shots of them in the same spot, 15 years later. In addition, there will be a few shots with my niece and nephew, two happy additions to the family over the years.</p>
