                <p>Most of us have been waiting patiently for <a href="http://www.gizmorepublic.com/portable/rogers-iphone-3g-plans-leave-canadians-green-for-att-6180">Rogers to finally release their data rates for the iPhone 3G</a> that is coming to Canada on July 11th. The good news is that the wait is finally over -- Rogers just released full information about their plans.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Rogers completely missed the boat on this one. They had the chance to bring Canada to the forefront of the wireless world, but instead felt compelled to keep us locked up in our draconian past. There are no unlimited data rates for the new plans, and anything approaching 1GB will cost you $100 or more per month (plus, I'm sure, the 9/11 fee and the system access fee, bringing your bill to $120 or more).</p>
<p>To be honest, it's exactly what I expected, but I can't honestly say I didn't dare to hope that things might be better. On my recent trip down south I walked into a Best Buy and bought a pay as you go plan, <strong>including a free phone</strong>, for $15. No contract, no nothing. The same deal up here will run about $80, and you need your own phone. In addition, Jason lent me a little USB dongle for my laptop that took a GSM SIM card and provided unlimited internet access <strong>anywhere in the US</strong> for only $60/mo. We're so far behind here it's not even funny.</p>
<p>The iPhone is a revolutionary invention, but it really needs to be augmented with an unlimited data plan to bring it to fruition. Given that Rogers is adamant about a 3 year contract (I can't think of a single other carrier that wants a 3 year contract), and that their data rates leave much to be desired, I'm probably going to pass on getting the iPhone, and spend the next few days reflecting on the wireless dream that never was.</p>
