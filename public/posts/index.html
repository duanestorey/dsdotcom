                This is my first post in a long time, as you can tell. One of the reasons I'm writing 
an entry is due to what's been going on in the WordPress world. In case you've been living under a rock,
there is currently a big public battle going on between Matt Mullenweg, the company he runs, 'Automattic', and a rival 
called WP Engine.
I can only speculate as to the real reasons for this public spat. On its surface, one side claims it's about a trademark dispute. But based on the actions of 
that same side, it seems to be some poorly thought out plan to exert more control over the community, and to attempt ...

                Stock is one of those things that seemed magical before I made it. I had purchased a few cooking books, and many recipes said to use 'vegetable stock', 'chicken stock', 'beef stock', or 'fish stock'. At that time I was used to buying bouillon cubes to take the place of stock, but decided at some point to try making a homemade stock.
Not only is making stock at home easy, but it's a simple way to use up leftover pieces of vegetables and bones. I've grown accustomed now to making a chicken dinner on the weekend, and immediately afterwards putting the left over pieces into the pressure cooker to ...

                The Italian Mountain range known as the Dolomites is famously home to several amazing long distance thru hikes known as the Alta Vias, the High Routes. Many of these are old trails from World War I, complete with Via Ferratas, difficult stretches of climbing where a person needs to physically link themselves to metal guide wires. It's been on my wishlist for a few years now to actually walk one of these routes, and I may finally have the chance.
A few months ago I started planning to do one of long distance hikes in Italy this summer. At the time, I wasn't sure if the situation in Europe would ...

                With the COVID19 state of alarm shortly ending here in Spain, I've been slowly getting myself ready to do some long distance hiking. My original plan, before COVID19 hit the world, was to hopefully make it to Italy in the summer of 2021 to do a 10 day hike through the mountains. Whether or not that happens this summer is anyone's guess, but I'm still going to act like it may happen, which means I need to start training for a high-altitude hike in the mountains.
For the last month or so I have been trying to hike 15-20km of the Camino de Levante every week or two just outside of Valencia to get ...

                I was looking through some of my old posts recently, particularly with regards to COVID-19 and the first lockdown here in Spain, and realized I hadn't done an update in a while. Strangely, it's going on the one year anniversary from when this all started. I had friends visiting from Canada when this all began, and as each day went by more and more activities were suspended in Spain. The first inkling of trouble was that the tickets we had to a futbol match here in Valencia were ultimately cancelled. Thinking nothing of it, we decided to purchase other tickets to see Madrid play, and those too ...

                This last weekend I finally got around to writing up my trip report for my hike along the West Highland Way in 2018. Now that that's out of the way, I'm thankful I can finally get around to posting my thoughts on the Great Glen Way.
The Great Glen Way for all intents and purposes can almost be looked at as the second half of the West Highland Way (WHW). While the WHW finishes in Fort William, the Great Glen Way literally starts where it leaves off. After I finished the WHW, my friend Tony and I took the train to Edinburgh to relax for a few days. Heading back to the Great Glen Way was essentially ...

                While I've done my fair share of hiking in my life, as I've gotten older I've gravitated more towards multi-day hikes rather than single day hikes. I certainly enjoy an afternoon hike on a weekend, but there's something magical (and inherently challenging) about hiking for days or weeks at a time.
In 2017 I did my longest hike yet - the Camino de Santiago in Spain. I spent 28 days walking from St. Jean Pied de Port, France, to Santiago de Compostela, Spain, a distance of roughly 800km. When it was over, as I hobbled around Santiago de Compostela letting my feet heal, I told myself that my days ...

                I realized this morning that I haven't really given an update since I was smack-dab in the middle of our lockdown here in Spain. Most of us here spent 98 days essentially locked up in our apartments, only venturing outside to quickly get some groceries or to go to a pharmacy. It was one of the most intense and invasive lockdowns of any country anywhere, and many people here really struggled to cope with it. While I didn't mind being at home, especially since I had many renovation projects on the go, the inability to even go for a walk or to get exercise was really difficult mentally, and most ...

                Tomorrow marks the end of the third week of forced quarantine here in Spain, and unfortunately at this point there still is no end in sight. At the start of this week both the active cases of COVID-19 as well as the number of deaths seemed to be on the cusp of plateauing, but yesterday brought new highs for both. I normally try to stay up each night until midnight, mostly to see what the latest numbers are - while they aren't complete, usually there is an update shortly after midnight that gives some indication of what the next day may look like. And so far many of those updates haven't been very ...

                This morning I woke up and like most days since the quarantine started here in Spain, immediately checked the official statistics to see if the curve has started to flatten yet. Today's update shows rough 5,500 new cases since yesterday with another 443 people having died. roughly the entire capacity of Surrey Memorial Hospital back home in the Fraser Valley. While these numbers are slightly less than the ones from the day before, I've learned not to get too excited with a low day on the charts since often the next day more than makes up for it. What these numbers mean, besides the obvious horridness ...

                On January 7th, 2020, I was on an airplane flying from Vancouver, Canada, to Spain, fully unaware of what was occurring in Asia with regards to a novel coronavirus, now known as COVID-19. Little did I know, in roughly two months we would be on lockdown here in Spain for the foreseeable future in an effort to curb the rapidly increasing countrywide death rate associated with COVID-19.
Like many countries who now find themselves in a similar place, Spain mostly ignored the lessons we should have learned from Italy, and Italy largely ignored the lessons they should have learned from China. The end ...

                In 2004, the Human Genome Project was completed. The goal of that project was to sequence the entire human genome, ultimately revealing the cause of a majority of ailments in the modern world.
Instead what it revealed was that most of us share over 99% of our genetic code, and that 1% difference doesn't seem to explain many of our diseases. So if our own genetics aren't entirely responsible for if we are healthy or sick, what else potentially can be?
The answer to that question came shortly after the development of 16s rRNA sequencing technology - technology which allows us, for the first time, ...

                There is great deal of evidence to show that our guts used to be in a much healthier state decades ago. For example, the Hadza in Africa, one of the last 'hunter-gatherer' species on the planet, appear to have 300% more bacteria in their guts than we do. It seems that over time we have lost many of these bacteria, and whatever functions they once provided.
In terms of gut health, one metric that's often used is diversity. Similar to the environment, it's often thought that the health of any ecosystem is related to the number of species in it and their relative abundance. Harmony is basically where ...

                Years ago, when looking for a way to do local WordPress development, I eventually stumbled upon a pretty nifty tool called MAMP.  MAMP stands  for "Mac/Apache/MySQL/PHP", and it's the Macintosh equivalent of the well-known Linux-based LAMP stack.
While you can configure MAMP by editing configuration files, I decided to upgrade to MAMP Pro, as it gives you an easier UI to use when managing some of your local websites.
Despite MAMP 'mostly working', it has a number of really annoying downsides as well:

MAMP Pro is paid software, but despite buying it multiple times, I don't really feel like I've ...

                I live a fortunate life. I have a profession that effectively lets me work from anywhere in the world, all while making an income generally in North American dollars. Popularized by such ‘visionaries’ as Tim Ferris, my lifestyle, and the lifestyle of potentially a billion people by the year 2035, is likely a new world norm. No longer are people like me stuck in offices - we can get on airplanes and work from anywhere in the world - from the remote jungles of Vietnam, to the beautiful mountains of Spain’s Canary Islands, to the wineries within a few stone’s throw from Table Mountain in ...

                Hey everyone,
I've started a new website called TapasForever detailing my goal for living for a year in Spain. If you're interested in the journey, or perhaps want to move to Europe for a year or longer in the future, head on over and check it out.

I recommend visiting the Start Here page for information on the various resources that will be available. I'm looking forward to getting my visa and checking off a lot of boxes in terms of things I would to accomplish in life (Spanish language, I'm looking at you!).
Cheers, Duane ...

                So if you're here, you're likely thinking about moving to Spain at some point. I know this, because that's my end goal as well. Maybe not forever, but likely for a year or more.

One of the first hurdles you may encounter is opening a bank account. Once you have a long-term stay visa or a temporary residence in Spain, you can open an account as a resident. But there are certain advantages to having one sooner. For example, I thought moving larger amounts of money from Canada to Spain would probably be much easier when I am actually physically present in Canada, so I thought opening a bank account ...

                One of the hardest aspects of being a business owner is being able to come up with a metric, even an internal one, for what it means for that business to be successful. For some people, that goal is completely monetary - i.e., if they can sell the business for 1 million dollars within 10 years, then that represents success for them.
 Making Your Business Work For You
As an example, one of my good friends recently sold his business. While it was always his dream to build a popular retail business, at some point he realized that the excitement, and the dream, mostly involved building a business, ...

                I recently was looking at a business plan for a new venture that came across my desk. The two individuals involved are trying to raise money for a bar in South America that they will manage. It's one of those businesses that most people dream about - a foreign country with lots of sunshine, lots of friendly travellers, and evenings spent sipping beer on a patio. Sign me up!
As part of their business plan, they needed to come up with a value for what this new business would likely be worth once it was off the ground. The reason you need to have a value is that when you are trying to solicit investments ...

                I recently made the decision to take advantage of Iceland Air's free stopover policy to visit Iceland on my way from Vancouver, Canada to Europe. If you weren't aware, Iceland Air allows anyone to stop for up to a week in Iceland without any additional charges. This is a brilliant marketing move, and it's help Iceland become a hugely successful tourist destination in the last few years (one tour guide told me that fishing used to be about 70% of the economy, and now tourism is coming close to eclipsing that).
Before I arrived, I had heard stories about how expensive the country is. Let me be clear, ...
