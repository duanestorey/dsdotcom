                <p>I'm sure we all have one, a list of things we'd like to do before that big farmer in the sky puts us out to pasture. I've got a small list in my head that I've been slowly trying to take care of over the years.</p>
<p><img src="images/alg_bucket-list.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>At the very top is playing guitar and singing live. I started playing guitar when I was 18 years old. My mom bought me a Fender Strat, and I practiced on that ampless for a few years. I've gone through various guitars over the years, and finally picked up an jumbo Takamine acoustic electric a few months ago, partially with the intent of someday playing live somewhere. Granted, I'd like to pick up an even nicer guitar before then, but this guitar is loads better than the one I had before it.</p>
<p>On most nights before bed I hack away on the guitar a bit and try to sing without making wine glasses explode in my apartment. It's a long journey, but I'm on the path I think. I actually tried to get a singing couch to help me figure out what I can and can't sing, but apparently they're all too cool for me around here. So, I'm just doing trial and error and seeing where it all ends up.</p>
<p>When I finally get the courage to do it, I doubt I'll tell anyone. Rather I'll stroll down to an open mic night somewhere in the Wack here and let 'er rip. But, that time is coming, maybe this fall or winter, and I'm looking forward to it.</p>
