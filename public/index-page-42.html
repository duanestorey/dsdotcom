                    I'm interrupting my photo entries for a quick post about my home garden. As I mentioned in a previous post, I decided the other day that I wanted to try growing a few things on my patio. I used to help my grandma with her garden when I was a kid, and I have fond memories out in the back of her house playing in the dirt. My patio in Chilliwack is about twice the size as my patio was in Vancouver, so I'm definitely sure I have the room now to grow a few vegetables.
I swung by the garden center the other day and picked up a few things. First, I picked up some soil, since I don't really have a lot ...

                    I haven't really had much to say on here in a while. Other than maybe a camping trip this weekend, and WordCamp San Francisco at the end of the month, the next six weeks or so are pretty booked up solid with some client projects. After that I'm going to take a bit of a break for the summer and do some camping or maybe even head over to Europe to visit some friends.
So on that note, I'm going to take a break from traditional blog posts and do a week or so worth of photo entries. Comment if you like, don't comment if you like :) But enjoy!

Obviously, I don't really have a lot of room out there, so growing things like potatoes are out of the question (not that I'd grow potatoes or anything). I could grow some herbs maybe I guess, but I'm not really sure when they grow best. I'm also thinking about putting a little compost bin outside so I can make some healthy soil for all my plants here.
Any thoughts? ...

                    A while ago I started messing around with trying to get a single WordPress installation to host multiple blogs. If you read that and think WordPress MU, you're not far off. What I don't like about WordPress MU though is that the system administrator chooses the themes and the plugins that are available to the end user -- ideally, I would want each user to control that themselves, such that it basically has the same functionality as a normal WordPress installation.
There are a lot of other reasons why you might want a single WordPress install for multiple blogs. First, if you make backups of each ...

                    I ran across this article this morning about credit card debt, and started trying to figure out what it meant in terms of numbers.

Nearly 80 percent of American families have at least one credit card, 44 percent of families carry a balance on their credit cards, and Americans pay about $15 billion a year in penalty fees, according to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's office.

The current population in the US is around 305 million (2008 census). I don't know how many families are in the US, but let's take a rough stab and there are about three people per family, or around 100 million families. ...

So, happy Star Wars Day everyone!

                    So before going to bed last night I walked into my second bathroom as was greeted with a not-so-nice smell. I thought maybe I had forgot to flush the toilet or something stupid like that, but everything was totally clean. I turned the fan on for a while, thinking it would go away, but it didn't really seem to. This morning the smell was still there, and I debated calling my building manager to see if they could take a look (or a smell).
Before doing that though, I Googled around a bit to see if I could figure it out. One thing I found out is that there's U-shaped pipe under each drain that's called ...

                    When I moved back to Chilliwack, one of the first things that changed was my diet. I typically worked long hours in Vancouver, and that naturally led to me eating a lot of restaurant food. I'd normally want to sleep in as long as possible in the mornings, so I usually skipped breakfast in exchange for a few more minutes of zzzz's. Lunch was normally something I'd eat down in the Food Court in the Bentall Center. There weren't a lot of food options, but I'd typically switch between Subway or sushi. Dinners were a bit more varied -- a lot of times I went out with friends after work, and other times ...

                    The other day I had the crazy idea of starting a community driven site here in Chilliwack. I pinged a few people online about a possible name, and eventually settled on InTheWack.com. In the back of my mind, parts of the site would be similar to Urban Vancouver, while others would resemble a more traditional newspaper. I whipped something together real quick on Friday night after I got back home from Vancouver, and have been sort of passively playing with it.
I've spoken to the odd person on Twitter that has offered to write the odd article. First, is Alexander Patton, a local 20-year old Chilliwack ...

                    I accidentally stumbled across the official Whitehouse Flickr account tonight, and was pretty enthralled by some of the photos in the account. First thing that's cool is that the Whitehouse even has a Flickr account. Second thing to take note of is that the photos are licensed with a creative commons attribution license, so basically you're free to use them in both commercial and non-commercial settings as long as you do proper attribution.
I've always liked looking at candid photos from other presidencies. For whatever reason, I took a fascination with those from Kennedy's administration, probably ...

                    By no means am I a twitter expert. In fact, I'm not really even certain what that moniker means. Saying you're an expert at Twitter is like saying you're an expert at talking, or being able to hold a conversation. Sure, you have to understand what an @ sign does, and how to direct message someone, but other than that Twitter is just another tool in a wide arsenal of technology that allows people to establish and build relationships.
I used to only follow my friends on Twitter. Even though I replied to most @ messages directed at me, I didn't follow everyone back, simply because I wanted to keep ...
