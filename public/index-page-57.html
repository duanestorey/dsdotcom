                    My blog appears to be in some weird state of limbo right now, bouncing between the black and the white background, depending on where you are viewing it from. It's rather strange, considering the TTL on my DNS entry is 30 minutes, so it shouldn't take this long at all.
Anyways, here is a trailer for season 3 or Heroes. I hope Peter keeps his shirt on for more of it.

                    I'm sure many of you know already know who Leslie Feist is. She's one of Canadian's most recognized young musicians now, thanks to obvious talent and also having her song 1-2-3-4 included in one of Apple's largest marketing campaigns.
If I remember correctly, Feist snagged five awards at the Junos, which is as close to a landslide as you can really have at an event like that. I unfortunately didn't get to meet her (she was rather popular that night), but I did get to hang out a few feet away from her and snap a few photos.

I was doing some reading in my RSS reader this morning and came across ...

                    I quickly stopped by Future Shop on my way home tonight and picked up a brand new power supply for my server at home. They had a really nice (that is, if power supplies can be described as such) $150 one that was on sale for $75, so I went with that. The good news is that my old power supply was basically taxed in terms of connectors, and it would have been impossible to add anything else to it. This new one has an extra 300W of headroom on it, and also 3 more SATA connectors.
To be honest, I wasn't even really sure it was the power supply, but it seemed like a pretty reasonable guess. The good ...

To be eligible, they are asking people to fill out a quick survey to get a bit of data with regards to telecommunications. Everyone reading this blog should be eligible.

So, if you'd like to potentially win a Nintendo Wii, I'd ask if you guys could please fill out a five minute survey.
If you're just a regular person (i.e. not a business owner), please fill out this version.
If you're a small to medium sized business owner, please fill out this one.

                    The first order of business with my new iPhone is picking up a decent case to keep it from being scratched. I called around town, but unfortunately nobody has any stock for the 3G iPhone cases yet. So basically the only place left to buy one from was on Apple's store.
I originally went over with the intent to buy one case. However, it appears that one case wasn't enough to qualify me for free shipping. Since I like free stuff, I decided to buy a few more things. Since I wasn't sure if I'd like the first case, I bought a second one with a different style. Worst case, I'm sure somebody will probably ...

                    I actually hit the sack before midnight last night, which is pretty much an unprecedented event in my life. The main reason was because I had to get up early and take my car into the shop to get some TLC.
While on my road trip a few weeks ago, a few things suddenly stopped working, including the door lock switch on the driver's side door, the CD player (it currently does a better job grinding CDs then it does playing them), and a small problem with my gear shifter. In addition, my car is about one year past the date I should have had a one year tune-up.

My niece and nephew love coming over because there are always coins lying around my apartment, and it's a fun game to find them. Despite my best efforts, I usually end up with change on counters and less frequently in my bed.

                    I've been messing around with the iPhone 3G pretty much non-stop for the last 24 hours. For the most part, it has exceeded my expectations.

First, being able to check your email or surf the web from any location is a pretty awesome feature. For example, today I was at the beach with some friends and we noticed that the tide was slowly creeping up the shore. I quickly fired up Safari, did a Google search for "Vancouver Tide Table", and determined that high tide was in about two hours.
As most people know, the iPhone 2.0 firmware brings with it the iPhone application store. I've already purchased ...

                    Well, to say that today was a complete clusterfuck would be a gross understatement. I arrived at the Rogers store around 9am, and spent the next five hours watching Roger's employees desperately try and activate my iPhone for me.

I actually ended up at a hold-in-the-wall Rogers store, which was great because there wasn't a huge line-up. Ironically, I ended up right behind my plastic surgeon in line, which was actually pretty cool because I got to spend 90 minutes just chatting with him and getting to know him.
They had 14 units at the store I went to, and only 4 at the Yaletown Rogers store. ...

As most of you know, I've been pretty harsh (justifiable so) against their iPhone rate plans. The last entry I posted basically said that if Rogers didn't cave before Friday, they were going to seriously hurt their credibility, not just amongst their wireless users, but also for the hoards of people that were exposed to the negative press.
The good news is that Rogers finally caved and offered a decent data plan ...

That photo is one of my favourites of my niece. It was probably taken when she was only 5 years old or so, but it was one of the first times I got to spend alone with her (I had been living out in Ottawa for a few years prior to that). I had told my sister that I was going to go to Burger ...

Man, I can't believe they are seriously pushing that. Yes, overweight kids probably have high cholesterol, but let's focus on a solution, not a patch. Most people would probably be surprised to know that the whole science of cholesterol is pretty weak. Lots of people live their whole lives with high cholesterol and never experience any problems, and some people with low cholesterol can be in danger for a heart attack.

The reason for this, according to the rumour, is that Apple is not pleased with the grassroots backlash that Roger's and the iPhone have received in Canada.
The thing is, it really doesn't matter if the rumour is true (and in my mind, I doubt it is -- it's more likely in my mind that they have general manufacturing problems and can't meet the demand) - either way, it's a huge PR nightmare for Rogers. There was one site earlier that posted the ...

                    Well, thus marks the end of my first two-week vacation stint. This vacation saw me bounce from San Francisco, to Los Angeles, back up to Vancouver, to a Matthew Good show, then to the North Cascades, up to Whistler, and then back home. Not bad for just over two weeks.

It was great getting to hang out with my sister, brother-in-law, and their two kids down in Disneyland. Despite only being an hour and a bit away, I don't get a chance to head home that often. Plus, I haven't really spent much time with my niece and nephew (although I was there in Chilliwack ...

                    As everyone knows, Rogers announced their lackluster iPhone plans not that long ago, and were immediately criticized by most Canadian wireless customers as being far too expensive. In addition, the lack of an unlimited data plan, a feature that Bell and Telus have for some of their phones, is also fairly disappointing give the web-based nature of the device.
In response to the data rates, RuinediPhone set up an online petition asking Rogers to change their data rates. Since going live nearly a week ago, they've amassed nearly 36,000 signatures, and have been featured on several mainstream news ...

                    I've always been a big fan of four day work weeks, or better yet, working at the rate which you are most productive. That's why I have always gravitated towards jobs that don't have fixed hours. Where I currently work, I really don't have a fixed schedule. If I wake up early, I'll stroll in at 8:30am. If I have a rough night sleeping, nobody cares when I stroll in at 10:30am. Given that flexibility, I'll often do a bit of work at home during the evenings when I'm listening to music or whatever.
Utah recently announced that they are switching their government employees to four day work weeks. A ...

                    Birkenhead Lake, last summer
At the Matthew Good show the other night I ran into a good friend of mine from high school. We ended up chatting and drinking beers over at Doolin's after, and it was great to catch up. Rob and I became friends back when I was working at Bonanza when I was 16, and I haven't talked to him in a few years.

It turns out that both Rob and I are on vacation this week with not a whole lot to do, so we decided to head up to Birkenhead Lake tomorrow and just chill out over a few beers. Birkenhead was the biggest surprise of last summer, ...

                    I got home from Canada Day tonight and spent a bit of time on IM chatting to people. My friend Jeff, who is one of my best friends from high school, was online so we ended up chatting for a bit. Despite living only a few blocks apart, the sad thing is Jeff and I rarely get to see each other due to both our crazy schedules.

I found out tonight that Jeff is moving to Victoria with his wife Michele and his daughter Maya. To be honest, while I want the best for them, it made me feel bad that I've been out of the loop so long with them that I had no idea they were moving away in a few weeks. I'm going ...
