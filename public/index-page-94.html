                    Well, this day is finally over, so I can write about it. I cracked a bottle of wine at 6:30pm and started going through some old photos for something to do. I decided about mid way through that I would use the opportunity to try out some wines that I've been meaning to check out for a while.
At around 10pm Tiffany strolled by and helped me on the drinking front. It was a pretty decent evening. I gotta get to bed for a 9am conference call tomorrow, but here are a few photos from today. ...

I just looked at my computer clock and realized that today is Valentine's day, and here I am, on my couch in the dark, alone. I talked with my ex-girlfriend briefly on the phone tonight, asked how she was doing, what she was up to, the same old same old. We were trying to figure out a time to get together for dinner, and she said that Wednesday night was obviously out. And even though I wanted to ask, I didn't. Because really, who wants to know what their ex is doing for Valentine's day?
So, what do I plan to do? I'm not really sure, but I imagine it's going to involve some liquor down at a local ...

                    So, I was multitasking at work today, installing Windows Vista on my laptop, and doing some work on my desktop machine. I thought the upgrade process would be simple, but instead it was a huge headache. First, Windows Vista Installer analyzed my whole machine and told me I was good to go. Then, I start installing it and it goes "wait a sec, just joking --- you gotta remove all this software first before you can install Vista." So, I uninstall Nero, my anti-virus program and a DVD RAM drive thing that I've never used. Install, take 2.
The next part of the process is rather uneventful, but I have ...

I've known about their wedding for a few weeks now, but tonight they stepped up and asked me to officially photograph their wedding for them. To be honest, I've been asked before by other people, mostly over a few drinks, and up until now I've basically always politely declined, mainly because I didn't think I could pull it off properly and do it justice.
So, after spending a few hours mulling it over tonight, I finally realized that I'm probably ready. Not only that, but most everyone ...

I spent most of today walking around doing errands, and tidying up at home a bit. I bought some new stainless steel pots and pans, so maybe I will actually start cooking at home again. I even made a decent batch of chilli tonight, which is pretty amazing considering I've only cooked once or twice in about six months.
My eye was bothering me quite a bit today. Most days it's pretty good and it feels normal, but today it felt all dry and scratchy, which put me in a crabby mood. I found out ...

I've been told I can't eat for at least four hours before the scan, so apparently this banana bread is my only meal until supper time. I'm not sure if they are putting some funky dye into my blood, but I'll know in a few hours I guess.
Update -- Ok, so it's all over now. I got down to St Paul's at around 4:15pm and just chilled in the waiting area for a while. At around 4:35, some lady calls me up and walks me into the room ...

There are lots of little and big things that we can all do to make a difference. The problem of global warming was created by the actions of many individuals and so the solution will also have to come from all of us. Really itâ€™s not that hard.

We started our "training" that January, first doing little tiny runs around the block, then eventually moving up to hour long runs along the water in Steveston, or through the University Endowment Lands (which is an amazing place to run).
The actual run itself was really fun, but a little too crowded for my liking. I didn't expect to have a very good time, but after training for four months, I really wanted to see just how good I could get -- unfortunately, I was sidestepping people for the first ...

                    Well, yesterday I posted my CFL challenge update. So far, I only have verbal commitments from people to change a few lightbulbs this weekend and contribute some photos. But hopefully they all pull through.
As for me -- I stopped at London Drugs on the way home and bought 6 CFL lightbulbs. Surprisingly, those 6 allowed me to replace 9 normal ones in my place (since the new CFL ones are way brighter in my bathroom -- so bright that I don't need all the lights I had in there).

Here's a summary of what that did:

Power removed from incandescent bulbs: (7x40W + 2x70W) = 420W
Power added from new bulbs ...

Basically all the flickr pieces on this website are handled by that plugin, so if you like what you see on this website, then feel free to test it on yours.
I still have a ton of work to do on it, mainly in the speed optimization area, but I figured it's good enough now for some people to test out. Enjoy. ...

                    Ok guys. I'm tossing the gauntlet down. If you haven't been following recent events, a few days ago a major report on global warming came out that had some of the strongest language in it to date.

The group of climate experts released a 21-page report for policy makers worldwide that indicates with more than a 90 percent accuracy that rising atmospheric temperatures and increased greenhouse gases are linked, and the "most likely" cause of global warming, suggesting that humans have caused the problem.
[...]
The report found that it was "more likely than not" that manmade greenhouse gases have ...

                    Well, I haven't had an interesting blog entry in a while, so I thought I'd give an update. I went out with Jana tonight to Sandbar on Granville Island -- it was a great time, and an absolutely amazing night to spend on an outdoor patio with good company and a bottle of wine. After I came back home and demonstrated my oh-so-rusty guitar skills in front of a live audience.
This week is completely packed solid, so look forward to a pile of photos from the events.. Next update will probably be in a few days :(

                    Last night Jason and I went down to Morton's Steakhouse here in Vancouver for dinner. I've heard about it alot from friends and business people -- apparently it's one of the top three steak houses in Vancouver. I've been to Gotham before (which is also very nice), but it was my first time being at Morton's. Jason and I both agreed that it was better than Gotham, at least for the meal we had.
Afterwards, we met up with Cisco down at Cardero's on the water and had a few more drinks. All in all, a nice relaxing night on the town. ...

                    I was doing a little last minute reading before going to bed, and stumbled upon this article. Apparently a parking garage in New York city will be operated by a computer. You simply drive your car onto a pallet, walk away, and it will be parked. Or maybe dropped.
Here's a good quote:

Built in 2002 across the river in Hoboken, N.J., with 314 spaces for monthly rentals only, the garage dropped an unoccupied Cadillac Deville six floors in 2004 and a Jeep four stories the following year.

Wow, where do I sign up? Luckily they were unoccupied, but still. Imagine coming back to pick your car up after ...
