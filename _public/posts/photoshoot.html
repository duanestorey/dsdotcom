                <p>About two weeks ago, I was contacted my Puma in Montreal and asked if I was willing to do a quick photoshoot for them for a female Team Canada player here in Vancouver. Apparently a friend of mine gave them a link to my Flickr photos, and said if they needed a photographer to help out sometime, that they should contacted me.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" srcset="/assets/posts/2007/photoshoot-1-320w.jpg 320w" src="/assets/posts/2007/photoshoot-1.jpg" alt="">Obviously, I was pretty flattered when they called me up, since up until now I have kept my photography completely informal and non-profit. But, with a $2000 Camera body that will need replacing within the year, and about $3500 worth of lenses, it really would be nice to make a few bucks on the side to help pay for some new gear. So, after passing a few emails back and forth, I eventually agreed that I would do it for them.</p>
<p>So on Friday I met Martina down at Trout Lake in Burnaby and shot about 100 shots in about an hour. I put all the shots on a webserver for them to access remotely, and got official feedback last night that they loved all the shots, so I would say the shoot was a success. I’ve been told that the only difference between a pro and an amateur photographer is that professionals can charge money for their work, so I’m not sure what that makes me now. I guess I’m going to take it a bit more seriously and maybe put together an official photo site of some of my stuff and gear it more to doing future work.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for all their support so far. This could be a pretty fun side job if I continue to get the odd job, and will hopefully allow me to get better equipment as time goes on.</p>
