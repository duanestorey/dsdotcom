                <p>So, this weekend I decided to leave the city life behind and join my dad and Cathy for a few days in the wilderness down south.? The destination was a little place along the ocean called Fort Casey, near Deception Pass, Washington.? I had a great time, consuming an ample amount of alcoholic beverages, and sitting by the fire.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the one major downside to travelling to the United States is having to go through customs on both sides.? No matter how many times I cross, or how many stamps I have in my passport, I always get grilled pretty hard.? It’s gotten worse now that I have a decent car.? ? The way down wasn’t that bad, although the border guy asked me “do you have anything in the car?”, which I had no idea how to respond to.? “Uhh, yeah, I have stuff in the car.”? ? The way back was even worse.? My dad gave me a Calvin Klein duffle bag that he got for free when shopping in the duty free shop.? I figured all I had to do was tell the border guy I got a free bag, and I would be on my way.? Here’s how the conversation went:</p>
<ul>
<li>Border guy: “Can I see your ID”</li>
<li>Me: I hand him my ID.</li>
<li>Border guy: “No, I don’t want to hold it.? I just want to see it.”</li>
<li>Me: “Uh, ok”.? I open my passport and show it to him.</li>
<li>Border guy: “Where you from?”</li>
<li>Me: “Vancouver”</li>
<li>Border guy: “Where were you?”</li>
<li>Me: “Camping near Fort Casey.”</li>
<li>Border guy: “Why were you camping alone?”</li>
<li>Me: “I was camping with my parents.”</li>
<li>Border guy: “Where are you parents?”</li>
<li>Me: “Not with me.”</li>
<li>Border guy: “You bringing anything back?”</li>
<li>Me: “Yeah, my dad gave me this free bag.”</li>
<li>Border guy: “What’s it worth?”</li>
<li>Me: “It was free.”</li>
<li>Border guy: “But what is it worth?”</li>
<li>Me: Obviously confused.? “Zero.? It was a gift when they bought something else.”</li>
<li>Border guy: “Nothing is free.? What is it worth?”</li>
<li>Me: Holding the bag up to the window, showing him the big sticker on it that says *Free*.? ? “It says free, I think that means it was free.”</li>
<li>Border guy: “Yeah, but what is it worth?”</li>
<li>Me: “Uhh, $10.”</li>
<li>Border guy: “It looks like it’s worth more than $10.”</li>
<li>Me: “How about $20.”</li>
<li>Border guy: “Ok.? Anything else you’re bringing back?”</li>
<li>Me: “No.”</li>
<li>Border guy: “What about alcohol? Any of that?”</li>
<li>Me: “No.”</li>
<li>Border guy: “Any tabacco?”</li>
<li>Me: “No.”</li>
<li>Border guy: “Any weapons?”</li>
<li>Me: “Still no.”</li>
<li>Border guy: “Ok, go ahead then.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, I hate crossing the border.? Ironically I always have more problems getting back into Canada than I do leaving it.? Oh well.</p>
