                <p>I was doing a little last minute reading before going to bed, and <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/business/technology/16574270.htm">stumbled upon this article</a>. Apparently a parking garage in New York city will be operated by a computer. You simply drive your car onto a pallet, walk away, and it will be parked. Or maybe dropped.</p>
<p>Here’s a good quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Built in 2002 across the river in Hoboken, N.J., with 314 spaces for monthly rentals only, the garage dropped an unoccupied Cadillac Deville six floors in 2004 and a Jeep four stories the following year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, where do I sign up? Luckily they were unoccupied, but still. Imagine coming back to pick your car up after a long day of work, only to find it in a smoking heap because some engineer forgot to a carry a one somewhere in the code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dennis Clarke, the chief operating officer at Robotic Parking, acknowledged the operational problems, but said the garage has operated with “99.99 percent efficiency.” He called the 26-hour outage a freak incident, where two redundant sensors failed at the same time and a maintenance crew failed to follow company policy in not repairing them right away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the real question is what does efficiency mean? Does it mean the ability to get your car out? Or does that include dropping your car? Because 99.99 percent means 1 out of every 10,000 cars is inefficient. Which means roughly once a month in this garage somebody’s car is getting totalled.</p>
