                    I ended up doing a bunch of work on Saturday night, and just hung out close to home. A quick twitter by me saying I was going to have a few casual drinks at my place led to Dave showing up for a few beers. After that, we went down to the Six Acres to meet up with Trevor, and then ultimately over to Matt‚Äôs house for a few quick drinks.
When I got home that night, I realized just how tired I was. I passed out on the couch around 4am, and quite literally woke up sometime around 5pm last night. I got up here and there to answer my phone and check email, but I just couldn‚Äôt force my body to wake ...

                    Last Friday I met a pile of people from the Vancouver technology scene down at the Lamplighter pub in Gastown. Apparently that location is surrounded in controversy, since the Lamplighter has recently changed hands and has been transformed into a more ‚Äúmodern‚Äù establishment. I can‚Äôt say that I ever hung out in it before, but it seemed like a pretty cool place on Friday.
I would have shown up and mingled regardless, but on Friday I volunteered to drop by and take some photos of the Vancouver Technology Women for this year. That list was put together by none other than blogger-extraordinaire, ...

                    Well, it‚Äôs almost the weekend again. I awoke this morning to some major construction going on in one of the units around me, and I sure hope it‚Äôs done before Saturday morning rolls around.
Last night I hit Wings on Granville with Rebecca, Keira and John. For those of you who haven‚Äôt been, it‚Äôs a quaint little spot next to the Howard Johnson hotel on Granville Street that has cheap wings from 2-6pm daily.

  Rebecca and Keira, photo by KeiraThe girls basically did two pitchers of beer by themselves, so I imagine they were feeling pretty tipsy by the time they left.

                    Tonight I went down to the Republic to partake in the second Launch Party. It‚Äôs basically a mixer for technology enthusiasts, and an opportunity for a few startups to showcase their new products.
There were about 150 people that probably showed up, and it got rather tight and cramped at times, but it was cool meeting a lot of the people involved, and hanging out with a few old friends.

The Sxip GirlsI‚Äôm still on some drugs, so I refrained from drinking, which was actually rather nice in a way since I spent $0 at the function tonight.

I haven‚Äôt been out to one of these in a long time, mainly because I‚Äôve been feeling a bit under the weather for the last few months, but I think I‚Äôm going to check it out tomorrow.
Launch Party recently launched a new website, and if you look very, very closely, you may recognize the header image on it üôÇ
So, hopefully I‚Äôll still feel like heading out tomorrow. I will be good to catch up with some old tech friends and see what‚Äôs new. Plus, it gives me an excuse to ...
