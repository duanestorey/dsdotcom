                    On Thursday I’m getting on a plane and heading out to Hamilton for a few days prior to heading down to the Mayan Riviera. I have a lot of things to get off my plate before then, and am hoping to even hit the mall at some point to do a bit of shopping. My laptop has been down in Vancouver getting fixed, and hopefully I’ll be getting it back tonight (that’s a whole blog post in itself). I have to say that not having a laptop around has been a total pain in the rear end. Tomorrow I plan to work from a coffee shop again, as I find it’s a really nice atmosphere (and the scenery is a bit better ...

                    Well, I made it. The flight was, for the most part, uneventful. I actually had to stop in Edmonton briefly which was unexpected. That being said, it got me off the plane for 20 minutes to stretch and get a bit of sunshine, which was nice.
In fact, it was one of the most enjoyable flights in a while. I spent most of it reading a book I picked up in the Vancouver airport called “From Good To Great” which methodically investigated the top 11 companies in the last 30 years to see what they did differently than the rest. I usually don’t like business books as most of the authors seem to be full ...

                    I spent yesterday mostly sitting around and watching movies, which was a nice change from the norm. I also started work on a new BuddyPress Chat plugin that will allow user-user chatting, similar to Facebook style. When I was down in San Francisco at WordCamp, I told Andy Peatling that I really wanted to contribute something to BuddyPress if I could, so I thought a chat feature might be a cool feature.
I still have a ways to go, but I have the code which takes a user from “Offline” to “Online” chat status working now. Next step will be to display a list of Online friends, and then obviously ...
