                    After work I swung by the Alibi room in Gastown to help celebrate Jeremy Crowle’s birthday. I was a bit tired from this whole week so didn’t end up staying out super late, but I managed to drink a few rum and diet cokes and buy Jer a beer.
There’s another party tonight that I was invited to, but I’m not sure if I’ll hit that. I think I really need a nice night inside with some movies. I have to hit the airport in a sec and drop my friend Hesty off for the start of his vacation. After that I’ll probably check out the Eastside Culture Crawl with some friends.
Also, Rebecca and John are ...

                    In 1905, a research paper was submitted that forever changed how science views the world. In it, the author postulated that the laws of physics, which were at the current time regarded as universal, actually depended on the relative motion between the object and that of the observer.
The consequences of that paper are far reaching, for it implies that even the passage of time itself depends on motion. That is, two clocks that are absolutely synchronized at rest will no longer be synchronized if the clocks are forced to travel at different speeds. That result, proven time and time again in many ...

                    I’ve been waiting patiently for this update, since I’ve had quite a few problems with wireless since switching to Leopard. I also need to drop my Mac off at the repair facility to probably replace the logic board in it, since I’ve been having weird LCD and sleep problems on my Mac. Unfortunately, there seems to be over a week delay at MacStation for even looking at these things, which means I’ll basically be computerless for a while. I’m sure I’ll survive, but will be weird not to have a computer at home. Maybe I can go back to doing “normal” things again for a while.

                    About six months ago I got it into my head that I wanted to play around with RSS technology and see if I could come up with something cool with it. That eventually turned into a standalone RSS reader I wrote for the Mac called TrollDigger. The one feature everyone liked is the ability to view the actual pages instead of the RSS excerpts. I haven’t touched it since then, and the version that’s currently available for download is a bit clunky, but I was thinking about spending a few hours on it this weekend.
To be honest, lately I’ve been thinking about a completely GUI-less RSS reader. I’d ...

I’ve spent the last little while traveling, and to be honest, I’m starting to get a bit tuckered out.

Want to know what I’m looking forward to doing the most right now? Grocery shopping, if you can believe that. I’m going to head down to Urban Fare and pick up a pile of food so I don’t have to eat out for a while. I think tomorrow night I’m going to make a lasagna ...

                    For some reason, I seem to get a lot of flack for getting ready for Christmas this early. There are those who can’t possibly believe that someone would put their decorations up in November, instead waiting until the last minute to put theirs up.

                    A few days ago I attended Kaede’s one year birthday party out in White Rock. She got a ton of presents and had a really great time.

                    Last night I met up with Rebecca and John for some drinks at Fogg ‘N Sudds on Robson Street. It’s pretty much tradition with those two to watch any weekend hockey games down there, and whenever I can, I swing by to sample their fish bowl high ball drinks.
Afterwards, we all went over to Trevor’s house and sat around drinking wine. Trevor has a pretty cool penthouse apartment in the West End with a great view of Vancouver.

                    So, I’m not sure if this is a good idea or not, but whatever. I’ve been messing in garage band for about six months now, wanting to record something but just not sure what to record. I used to be in choir over 20 years ago, and I can sort of carry a tune. I know I need to have a ton of practice to get anywhere close to where I used to be as a kid (and most of my practice was pre-puberty, so I have to re-learn a deeper voice), but I decided to get over the hump and just quickly record something and take my beats for it.

                    My mom just emailed me and asked if I had started decorating my apartment yet. I figured I’d throw a photo up just to show her and everyone else.

  
Still have a ways to go, but it’s looking not bad. I have another strand of lights to put up somewhere, and I might get some for my patio. I also have some of those Christmas house things to put up, and I even have some fake snow for them. ...

                    I finished my antibiotics last week, which in theory meant I should have been completely fine and back to normal. Unfortunately, that’s not the case, something that sometimes happens with this type of infection I have. I spent a bit of time in the doctor’s office yesterday, and for whatever reason, they want a full spectrum of tests done again just to make sure they didn’t miss anything. Except for some cramps, it’s not really affecting me that much, but I’m anxious to be all over this.

                    Well, it’s not very often I’ll write about TV shows, mainly because I don’t really watch a lot of TV. In an effort to get my expenses down a few months ago, I decided finally to pull the plug on cable, something that I haven’t regretted in the least. The only show I really watched last year was 24, and once that season ended, I just cancelled it all, saving myself $60 a month or whatever.
A while ago, I went out and bought all of Heroes season one on HD-DVD. I thought it was a decent show, but there were a lot of characters I wasn’t interested in at all. The finale was pretty lame too, ...
