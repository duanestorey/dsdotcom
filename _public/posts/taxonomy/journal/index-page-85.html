                    I had the need to make a few state machines today, and grew tired of doing them on paper. Derek pointed me towards GraphViz, which is a graphics package capable of doing finite state machine diagrams. All you need to do is generate a simple text file that outlines the state transitions, and their “dot” program will output the state machine diagram for you. Pretty nifty.
Here’s a simple example I did:

                    A new study says people who have full-fat milk gain *less* weight over time. I hate to say I told you so, but I’m not a big believer in the whole “fat makes you fat” belief. I agree saturated fat isn’t very good for you, but the other types of fat are. As long as you don’t eat the grissle in a steak, over 2/3 of the fat in it is good fat, which is better than most other things. Which gives me an idea for another blog entry later tonight.

Having those hard problems to solve is nice as well, but sometimes it’s nice to fall into “brick-laying-mode” where you can just crank out code and feel good about it.
At the end of the day I had my six week follow up with the plastic surgeon who did my surgery. When I saw him after week two, I was a bit concerned because it still didn’t look right. He suggested we give ...

                    Well, on New Year’s eve, my Samsung A920 stopped working. Right around the stroke of midnight. Should I be worried?
Here’s the deal though. This is the *second* A920 I have owned in about 6 months. Granted, the first one breaking was completely my fault, but I’m pretty bummed that it’s dead now. I’ve had cell phones die before, and no matter the circumstances of how they die, the repair guys always come back and say “water damage — not fixing.” And here’s my take on it.

                    I spent last night hanging out at Bob and Candice’s house. It was a good party, and I had a lot of fun ringing in the New Year. Normally I call a pile of people at midnight and wish them happy New Years, but for some reason my cell phone stopped working last night.
