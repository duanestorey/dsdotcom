                    I read this link tonight, and it reminded me of my friend Jeff’s cousin who died while running from the police in California (not sure why he ran, but the police didn’t really seem to care — they just shot him a few times and he stopped running). Now the guy in this article I just read *was suspected* of killing a cop, but seriously: did they really need to shoot him 68 times?
Here’s a great quote:
“I suspect the only reason 110 rounds was all that was fired was that’s all the ammunition they had,” Judd said. “We were not going to take any chance of him shooting back.”

                    Wow, I just woke up. Not a very exciting day, but it’s nice to have a good rest. I got up earlier and went for a walk, stopped by the plant shop, and headed home to see what was on TV. I was pleasantly surprised that Garden State was on, so I watched that (I saw it about 6 months ago, and really liked it — although Natalie Portman was a bit stiff as always). Several things stuck out this time:

Natalie Portman isn’t a very good actress (IMO)
Zach Braff directed the movie (I didn’t know that the first time around)
He also looks a lot like John Ritter did when he was younger
The soundtrack ...

                    Well, the time has come for me to give up caffeine once again. Why you might ask? Because I’m way too addicted to it, and I know how completely shitty it is for the body. Here are some reasons why caffeine sucks:

It disrupts REM sleep, making you feel tired in the morning
It increases cortisol, making you feel stressed out
It distrupts the body’s glucose system, increasing insulin levels by as much as 50%
It makes weight loss difficult since the body can’t burn fat with high levels of insulin in the blood

The problem with working in a high tech industry is that there’s free pop. So, ...

                    Why is it that hairdressers just can’t follow simple instructions? How does “just a little off the top” translate into “shave my head bald?” I just don’t get it. I’ve been trying to grow my hair a bit longer for like six months now, and yet whenever I go in to clean the sides up a bit, they always chop like a full inch off the top, even though they always promise not to.
It doesn’t start that way either, which is what I don’t get. The hairdresser always says “yeah, don’t worry, I’ll just take a quarter inch off the top to clean up your ends.” And then, it all just goes ...

                    I accidentally went through my cell phone pictures tonight, and was really surprised that I had so many. So, I pulled a few off from my adventures this summer and added them to my flickr cell phone set.

Here’s one from the John Mayer concert. I didn’t think I’d go to this concert, but it sort of fell together at the last second.

                    Well, it’s been a very busy couple of days. I got a call on Thursday at work from my step-mom telling me that my dad was in the hospital because he had a small heart attack during the night. I left work to go to Chilliwack and be with him in the hospital. He’s doing really well, and is mostly just bored now. They’re going to take him to New Westminster in the next few days to do an Angiogram and see what he looks like inside. Everyone is confident he’s going to make a complete recovery, so that’s great.

                    So, I’m all over this “chilling out at home” thing. I’ve spent the last few nights just pittering around my apartment, drinking coffee, and listening to music. Hell, I even cooked my own dinner tonight (it wasn’t very good though). I feel a lot better now that I’ve had a few good nights of sleep, even though I could still use a bit more.
I rediscovered some panorama software on my computer, and decided to try and stich a few together. Here’s is a stich of a few shots from my apartment this weekend. Sean asked me to try one at night, so I’ll do that soon too.

                    Well, I can honestly say that as much as I like travelling, it sure is nice to be back home. Leaving my home city always makes me appreciate it more when I get back home. Von was a great time, but I’m looking forward to relaxing and catching up on sleep for the next few days.. I just got back from the mall where I bought a bunch of new clothes (winter’s coming after all). I also picked up the new John Mayer CD (Continuum), and have been listening to it. It’s pretty mellow, but it’s actually really good. His concert is coming up next week here in Vancouver.
