                    As most of you remember, last year I threw the environmental gauntlet down and challenged all my readers to replace their old, energy inefficient incandescent light-bulbs with the newer CFL variant. Many of my friends and readers quickly went to work and replaced many of the bulbs in their houses, some even going as far to replace every single one. I replaced most of the ones in my apartment, and probably save on average of about 0.3kWh every day in my place alone.

I actually started a Flickr group for this purpose last year to help motivate people. I was a bit surprised to go into it tonight ...

                    Are you trying to save energy by changing over incandescent light bulbs to CFL bulbs? Well, there may now be a new alternative that uses even less power.
Glow in the dark kitties!

Yes, you too can own one of these purring light-bulbs! Simple feed them from time to time and all your energy needs are solved!
You can read about it here. ...

                    Well, yesterday I posted my CFL challenge update. So far, I only have verbal commitments from people to change a few lightbulbs this weekend and contribute some photos. But hopefully they all pull through.
As for me — I stopped at London Drugs on the way home and bought 6 CFL lightbulbs. Surprisingly, those 6 allowed me to replace 9 normal ones in my place (since the new CFL ones are way brighter in my bathroom — so bright that I don’t need all the lights I had in there).

Here’s a summary of what that did:

Power removed from incandescent bulbs: (7x40W + 2x70W) = 420W
Power added from ...

                    Ok guys. I’m tossing the gauntlet down. If you haven’t been following recent events, a few days ago a major report on global warming came out that had some of the strongest language in it to date.

The group of climate experts released a 21-page report for policy makers worldwide that indicates with more than a 90 percent accuracy that rising atmospheric temperatures and increased greenhouse gases are linked, and the “most likely” cause of global warming, suggesting that humans have caused the problem.

The report found that it was “more likely than not” that manmade greenhouse ...
