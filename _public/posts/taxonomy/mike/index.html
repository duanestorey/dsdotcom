                    As I mentioned in my last blog entry, the other day I had a chance to photography my first wedding. All in all, it was a pretty rewarding experience.
The day started at around 11am for me and Hesty. We suited up, did some last minute charging of equipment, and then got in touch with the groom. Normally the photographer heads over to the where the bride is getting ready for some photos, but Kim’s aunt wanted to do those ones, so I was relieved of that duty.
We met Mike and the groomsmen down at the Holiday Inn in Langley to get ready. In true Chilliwack style, Mike, instead of hopping in the ...

                    Last night I had the chance to photograph the wedding of two of my old friends. It was a great experience, and I’m fairly satisfied with how the photos turned out, considering how dark it was both outside and inside the reception area.

  
I’ll do a full write-up on everything I learned about shooting a wedding, but right now I have a turkey to eat. I shot over 1000 shots at the wedding, and I’ve slowly been sorting them. I put about 150 or so of them on Flickr if anyone is interested. There are still more I have to process and put together, but there’s enough that it’s fairly good representation ...

                    I’m in a hotel in Langley, and I’ve started to sort the photos from tonight. Having been to the location and having spent some time with old friends, I’m feeling a lot better about tomorrow.

  
Danika, the flower girl
I’m really glad I got a chance to try out a bunch of photos in a real setting, because I made a few mistakes that I likely won’t make tomorrow. I’m gonna keep this short, because I still have lots to do. Next blog entry will probably be Sunday after everything is over. ...

                    Sometime this summer, my friends Mike and Kim are gonna finally tie the knot together and live happily ever after. I’ve known about their wedding for a few weeks now, but tonight they stepped up and asked me to officially photograph their wedding for them. To be honest, I’ve been asked before by other people, mostly over a few drinks, and up until now I’ve basically always politely declined, mainly because I didn’t think I could pull it off properly and do it justice.
So, after spending a few hours mulling it over tonight, I finally realized that I’m probably ready. Not only that, but ...
