                    I‚Äôm nearly packed for my trip. Truthfully, I‚Äôm looking forward to getting away this weekend and relaxing a bit. The main reason I‚Äôm going is because Dave and Lauren are getting married on Saturday.

That said, I‚Äôm hoping to meet up with a friend tomorrow night and maybe go catch a movie or go bowling or something. My friend Lynn is also coming along to the wedding on Saturday, which should be a lot of fun.
The wedding is in a really cool location called the Herban Feast near Sodo Park. It looks like a really amazing spot, and I‚Äôm looking forward to shooting some photos in the venue. ...

                    It‚Äôs official. Sometimes I get harassed at the border, sometimes my car gets dented in a parking lot. But usually when I‚Äôm down south something happens that shows just how much the US hates me.
Today I was driving along, having a pretty good time listening to music, when I looked up in my rear view mirror and saw the cherries flashing. Since it‚Äôs been about 12 years since I‚Äôve been pulled over, I didn‚Äôt even really get that the lights were for me. I thought, ‚Äúhmm, that‚Äôs peculiar, I wonder why he doesn‚Äôt just go around me.‚Äù Anyways, I pulled over to the side of the road, and ...

                    Yesterday, after dropping Boris off at his place so that he could get ready to go to Spain, I went down to Broadway Camera to see if I could play around with a Canon EOS 40D camera. I had called the day before to see if I could actually purchase one, but unfortunately they said they were already completely sold out.
So imagine my surprise when, after asking if they had any in stock (which was basically a rhetorical question for me), they said ‚Äúyeah, we have one here.‚Äù Unfortunately for me it was the box that contained the kit-lens, when I really wanted to just purchase the body only. The lens ...

                    The first thing to note is that I cannot seem to find my little Canon camera, and it‚Äôs the one I took all the photos with at Rob and Anna‚Äôs wedding. So while I‚Äôm pretty sure it will turn up, unfortunately I do not have any photos to go with this entry üôÅ Oh well.
The wedding was quite lovely, and it was absolutely great to hang out with old friends again. It was a bit shocking to me to remember just how good some of these friends were. I guess my time back in Vancouver has sort of dulled my memory of what Ottawa life was like, but I received a lot of hugs and a lot of people went out of ...

                    A few years ago, I was the best man in my friend Jeff‚Äôs wedding. One of the responsibilities of the best man, as you probably know, is to organize the stag and to get the groom insanely drunk. I didn‚Äôt do anything amazing crazy for Jeff, but I did organize a big drinking pub crawl with some of his friends around town.
I also bought a bunch of disposable cameras and distributed them to all the people attending, hoping that we would get some great shots of the event. After I got home that night (and I can‚Äôt honestly remember how I got home), I ended up with a plastic bag of disposible cameras, ...

                    Sometime this summer, my friends Mike and Kim are gonna finally tie the knot together and live happily ever after. I‚Äôve known about their wedding for a few weeks now, but tonight they stepped up and asked me to officially photograph their wedding for them. To be honest, I‚Äôve been asked before by other people, mostly over a few drinks, and up until now I‚Äôve basically always politely declined, mainly because I didn‚Äôt think I could pull it off properly and do it justice.
So, after spending a few hours mulling it over tonight, I finally realized that I‚Äôm probably ready. Not only that, but ...
