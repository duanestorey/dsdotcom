                    Right before I left on my big adventure, almost everyone in my family was talking about going on a New Year’s diet. Years ago I was having trouble dropping a bit of weight, so I tried the Atkin’s diet when it was all the rage, and lost so much weight that it wasn’t even funny. Since that time I’ve studied up on why low carb diets work and have to come the one conclusion that refined carbohydrates are pretty evil. So while I’m not as lean and fit as I once was, I try to stay away from anything that causes big spikes in blood sugar and insulin, such as sugars, starches, flours, etc.

                    I haven’t stepped on a scale in about a month, but without a doubt I have been continuing to slowly shrink. I know this because the current belt I use to hold my pants up has five holes, and I’ve gone from the hole at the far side down to the hole at the other side. In about a week I don’t think this belt is going to do the job anymore, at which point I’ll probably buy a new one.
I’ve been meaning to go to the gym quite frequently this last month, but just haven’t really had the motivation for a few weeks now. Hopefully this weekend I’ll get back into my normal routine and start ...

                    Given that summer is just around the corner (at least, I hope it is — it’s really hard to tell with this weather), I decided about 6 weeks ago to try and get in better shape. One of the things I wanted to do when I moved out to Chilliwack was to be a bit healthier. I’ve definitely done that in terms of what I eat, but not so much in terms of how much exercise I get in a typical week. Summer is usually better for me as I like hiking and playing tennis, so I’m sure it’ll increase.
When I got back from Hamilton at the start of March I decided to start hitting the gym hard and being very ...

                    It’s true, I hate going to the gym. Lots of people say they go and get this massive rush of endorphins and it makes them feel like they are on a high all day. I generally feel a bit more energetic when I leave the gym, but not to the point where I feel super amazing. I see some of the people who do hours at a time of cardio, and I just can’t imagine how they do it.
The thing is, it’s not that I’m lazy. I love sports, and I’d like nothing more than to whack a tennis ball around now or play a game of badminton. For the most part though, I just find the gym super boring. Maybe I need some ...
