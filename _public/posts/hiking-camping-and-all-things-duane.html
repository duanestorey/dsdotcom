                <p>I woke up yesterday to another sunny day here in CowTown™. I was debating going to the gym, but decided instead to go and try a local hike. So I pulled my hiking boots out of a box, found some clean socks, and drove up to the trailhead for Teapot Hill, which is only about 10 minutes from my house.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/4379557559/" title="IMG_2639.JPG by Duane Storey, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" srcset="/assets/posts/2010/hiking-camping-and-all-things-duane-1-320w.jpg 320w,/assets/posts/2010/hiking-camping-and-all-things-duane-1-480w.jpg 480w" src="_images/hiking-camping-and-all-things-duane-1.jpg" alt="IMG_2639.JPG"></a></p>
<p>Teapot hill isn’t that hard of a hike, but considering I haven’t been hiking really in years, it did a good job of wearing me out. The elevation gain is only around 300 meters, but a lot of that comes near the end. At the top of the hike is a pretty nice view of Cultus Lake, so I snapped a few photos and rested there.</p>
<p>I used to actually be quite the hiker. About 5 years ago I would meet up with some friends on the North Shore and do a hike a few times a month. It was a lot of fun, and it felt pretty awesome being outside and getting some exercise. I’m still quite a ways away from being in good enough shape to tackle some of the hikes I used to do, but I’m hoping to slowly work my way back up to that level. I hurt my knee fairly badly on the West Coast Trail a few years, so I’m hoping that that injury doesn’t affect by ability to hike in the long term, but only time will tell.</p>

<p>With the current weather being as nice as it is, I’ve started thinking about camping again. Last summer I didn’t really get out as many times as I had liked, so I’m hoping to make up for that this year. Because I didn’t have reservations to any spots last year, I pretty much never got into any campgrounds on the weekends that I wanted. So this year I’m going to actually reserve a pile of weekends at a few local campgrounds and hope for the best. In the event that I can’t make it on a particular weekend, I’ll probably just toss a Tweet up and see if anyone wants to use my spots.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’ve been giving this site quite a bit of thought recently and have decided to spend a bit less time blogging and tweeting. With summer coming I’m hoping to spend as much time as possible outside, which naturally means I’ll be on the computer a bit less and hopefully out whacking tennis balls around instead. So in the event that you swing by here and don’t see an update for a few weeks, it’s nothing to worry about — I’m probably just working on my culinary skills or out on a hike.</p>
<p>I’m packing for a quick trip to Hamilton right now to meet up with Dale and do a bit of work. I leave tomorrow morning and get into Hamilton in the early evening. I should be back next week sometime.</p>
