                <p>Today was a good day. I woke up this morning fully refreshed thanks to the 10 or 11 hours of sleep I got last night. I basically had no plans upon waking up, but found a message on my cell phone this morning from <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com">Boris</a> saying that people were meeting up on commercial drive for some brunch.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.migratorynerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/2289922124_d7aebc964d.jpg" alt="Scott Hadfield and Matt Mullenweg"><a href="http://scotthadfield.ca/">Scott Hadfield</a> and Matt MullenwegI hopped in the car and headed down to Havanas on the Drive, which is a pretty funky restaurant/gallery that I’ve heard good things about. There I met up with about twelve or so people, most of which attended Northern Voice. <a href="http://ma.tt">Matt Mullenweg</a> (now with a +1 from here for his battle against the dancing dude) also swung by for some brunch, and to take his Nikon DSLR for a spin in our city.</p>

All in all a really enjoyable day with some good people — the perfect end to Northern Voice and the weekend.</p>
