                <p>I actually came home with the intention of writing two separate blog entries, but I’m so frickin tired that I’m only gonna be able to get this one out. This is a pretty crazy little time at work right now, and I’m on day two of a pretty hard two week push. Yesterday was a 12 hour day at work, and today was pretty close to 14. By Friday I’m definitely going to be ready for a few drinks (or maybe a long nap).</p>
<p>Anyways. I was chatting wtih my brother-in-law on MSN earlier today, and he let me know that their house was broken into in Chilliwack this morning. The guys made away with most of the expensive electronics: two laptops, some random computer stuff, and a playstation portable (PSP). I’m sure they took more electronics (since Andy is a gadget-whore like myself), but those were the big highlights that were mentioned.</p>
<p>And to be honest, even though that really sucks, I’ve seen and heard of that happening enough times in my life that it doesn’t really seem to affect me that much. I’ve had my car broken into, and so have most other people I know. Just a few weeks ago my friend Chris had his car all smashed in his own secure underground parkade. Thankfully I’ve never had my apartment broken into (although in university some guy walked into my quad and stole our VCR while I was studying in my room).</p>
<p>The part that really upset me about this story though wasn’t that they stole some laptops, but that they went into my eight year old niece’s room and emptied her Piggy Bank that she’s been putting money into for the last few years. And seriously, I doubt she had more than $50 in there, but I remember what it was like to be a kid, and that would just break my heart if that happened to me. So, you can be sure that the first thing Uncle Duane does next time he’s in town is to donate a big wad of change out of my own Piggy Bank to offset what was taken from her.</p>
<p>I just don’t understand some people sometimes.</p>
