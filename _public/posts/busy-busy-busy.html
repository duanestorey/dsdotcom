                <p>Sorry I haven’t written anything for a few days, I’ve just been swamped trying to get my act together for December. First order of business is crazy Chad’s Christmas party tonight out near Metrotown. Next week is my Christmas party at work, which is out on the water at Bridges, so that should be a good time.</p>

A Cleaner Version Of Me<br />
I’m now seven days without any type of booze at all, and so far I haven’t really noticed that much. In fact, my bank account is in pretty decent shape thanks to not going out for dinners and drinks after work at all this week, which is rather nice.</p>
<p>Thanks to the meds I’m on, I’ve started to get some headaches. So far I’ve been able to counter them with a nice dose of advil, but I sure hope they don’t get any worse.</p>
<p>My ex-girlfriend called me late the other night and told me that she had decided to move back home. I haven’t really talked to her in about six months, so seeing her number on my call display was a bit weird. But I want to wish her all the best on Vancouver Island.</p>

Best Of Luck Desiree<br />
I while ago I apparently missed the article in the Vancouver Province about Martina Franko. She’s a Canadian soccer player who I did a photo shoot for some time ago for in conjunction with the soccer company, Puma. <a href="http://communities.canada.com/theprovince/blogs/postcardsfromchina/archive/2007/08/29/on-the-ground-in-tokyo.aspx">You can check out the article here, which also includes a photo from that shoot.</a> The rest of the shots from that shoot can be found <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/sets/72157601354458513/">in my Flickr stream</a>.</p>
<p>In just a few short weeks I’ll be back home for the holidays, and then heading out each for a few days of R &amp; R in Toronto. I’m totally looking forward to a nice break away from Vancouver, and it will be nice to be around snow again and hopefully see some people I haven’t seen in a while.</p>
<p>I’m going to spend all of tomorrow basically shopping and trying to get my place in order. I need some new sheets for my bed, as well as some groceries for a few events coming up.</p>
