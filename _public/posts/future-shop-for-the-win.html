                <p>I went out tonight and bought a new digital camera, the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canonsd870is/">Canon SD 870 IS</a>. I did some basic research before hand and that was one of about three cameras I considered buying for this upcoming weekend. What sold me on it was that a guy at work recently picked it up and heaped a pile of praise on it. Also, it’s the only camera in it’s class that had image stabilization *and* a useful wideangle end (something most cameras lack of this size).</p>
<p>This is, unfortunately, probably the 8th digital camera I’ve purchased in about as many years. Several of them had untimely deaths, and one was even the victim of a previous girlfriend’s stupidity. I have an older model Canon Digital ELPH that hit the floor hard in a New York bar a few years ago, and it’s never been the same. So hopefully this one doesn’t break on me.</p>
<p>After I got home tonight, I unpacked the camera, only to realize that it was missing the battery. It’s obviously a major bummer to come home with a new tech toy only to realize you can’t use it. I called Future Shop and they said to just come back and they’d get me another one.</p>
<p>When I got to Future Shop, I explained what happened to one of the sale’s people, who immediately went and talked to the manager. I wasn’t sure what was going on, but I really wasn’t in the mood to have to argue my case with anyone. When the guy returned, he apologized for what happened and then threw $80 worth of free stuff at me for my time. I didn’t even ask.</p>
<p>I don’t really have a lot of love for Future Shop, but it was pretty cool of them to give me a new battery pack and throw in some free stuff, including a nice leather case. I’ve done some bashing of those guys on my blog in the past, so I figure it’s only fair to point out this time when they actually came through.</p>
