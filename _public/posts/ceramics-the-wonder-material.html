                <p>Years ago, had I gone to the dentist with a chip in my tooth, they probably would have just polished it up a bit with the grinder and sent me home. Thankfully, with all the advances in material science, that is no longer the case.</p>
<p>I had a scheduled cleaning with my dentist today, and just in passing I mentioned the chip in my tooth that I somehow obtained in Ottawa. It wasn’t really that visible, and mostly was just a small annoyance to me (since it had a different texture when I rubbed my tongue along it). However, once he took a look at it, he told me that he would fix it for me using ceramics.</p>
<p>So, about 20 minutes later I had a fully reconstructed tooth that completely matches it’s original profile. Stuff like that amazes me. After it was all over though, I realized I should probably be a dentist, since they somehow billed me $320 for 45 minutes of time. I guess repairing a chip using ceramics is BIG MONEY for them, since they seemed pretty excited to do it.</p>
