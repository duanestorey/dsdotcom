                <p>It’s that time again — time for me to take a little breather and catch up on sleep. Last week I was talking with my boss at work, and decided that maybe I should get away for a week and take some time off. I had originally booked a trip to Mexico back in November, but unfortunately due to a last minute surgery I had to have, had to cancel the trip entirely. So, I haven’t really had a proper break since July of last year. Needless to say, I’m a bit tired and worn out.</p>
<p>So, if all goes well, I’ll be taking the week after next off to relax. I’m not really sure what I’ll do. The <a href="http://www.northernvoice.ca">Northern Voice</a> conference is in Vancouver next weekend, and Kasia and I are heading down to check it out. After that, I think I might burn a few CDs, and hop in the car for a road trip. I’m a big fan of the Oregon coast, so I might just slowly make my way down there for a bit of camping or bed and breakfasting. I think it would be pretty sweet to kick my feet up in a hotel near the water and just plow my way through a few books. I have to be back in Chilliwack the following weekend for a house warming party and my mom’s birthday, so that leaves me with a good five days to explore. Maybe I’ll spend a day in Seattle, since I’ve never really spent any time there.</p>
<p>So we’ll see. I also have a $300 credit at a travel agency, so maybe I’ll apply it to a flight and get the heck of dodge for a few days. I’m not really sure.</p>
<p>But, I’ll make sure I blog from time to time on my vacation to let everyone know what I’m doing.</p>
