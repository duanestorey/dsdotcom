                <p>So, I had almost completely forgotten that the Trailer Park Boys were in town this week. My friend <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Kris</a> met them while he was at SXSW a few weeks ago and had a few drinks with the guys. He had said they were coming to town shortly, but it had slipped my mind until the end of the day today.</p>
<p>Since I figured that the Robson’s Chapters is on my way home, I swung by with my 70-200mm lens and decided to snap a few photos of the guys. I was hoping Kris or Robert would have been around so I could have gotten a quick intro (Mike Smith, or Bubbles, used to be part of a band I once listened to called Sandbox — something I would have loved to have told him).</p>
<p>I believe the new season starts this week, so if you’re into the show, make sure to check it out.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="http://www.matthewgood.org">Matthew Good</a> is currently streaming a single from his new album, Hospital Music, for registered members of his website. It’s a really amazing track, so I highly recommend checking it out.</p>
<p>Here are some of the shots from this evening.</p>
