                <p>I love Digg. I surf it at least a couple times a day, usually when I’m bored, sitting a work waiting for something to compile. I would say that without a doubt the majority of my “cool” news actually comes from Digg.</p>
<p>Lately I’ve begun submitting the odd story on my own to Digg. No matter how many times I try to submit something though, I always seem to get stuck on the same old problem — what category does the story fit in? The main problem I think is that Digg categories are more mainstream news oriented and less about the things I actually am interested in (even though I think most techies are interested in the same things I am).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.migratorynerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/falling-diggs.jpg" alt="Digg"><br />
Image <a href="http://www.marketingshift.com/2006/8/downfall-digg-forthcoming-here-why.cfm">from here</a>The main technology categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple – this seems straight forward</li>
<li>Design – <strong>what the fuck does this mean?</strong></li>
<li>Gadgets – I can live with that</li>
<li>Hardware – Isn’t that sort of a gadget? Or is it more computer oriented?</li>
<li>Industry News – What is considered technology industry news? That’s pretty open.</li>
<li>Linux – straightforward, all things Linux</li>
<li>Microsoft – spam folder?</li>
<li>Mods – for the engineer in all of us</li>
<li>Programming – shouldn’t we split web from non-web development?</li>
<li>Security – Security of what? Your house? Your files?</li>
<li>Software – this is pretty open ended too</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, that list isn’t completely horrible at first glance, but let’s try and categorize a few standard things. Let’s take a few of my interests, and some of the things I write about from time to time – Photography, Blogging, Social Networks, Internet Search. Where do these fit in?</p>
<p>You could fit Photography in the Arts section I guess, but that’s a fairly big umbrella. Most of photography these days is digital, so why not have a section on Digital Photography. I see tons of Digg articles all the time talking about HDR imagery, iPhoto, Aperture, etc., so why not have a section where these can end up in. Right now, these don’t really end up anywhere important on Digg.</p>
<p>Blogging? Nope, there’s no real category for that. If you’re talking about the technical side of blogging, it could fit into Programming. In terms of add-ons for blogs, cool new CMS platforms or things of that nature, nothing really fits. Another big miss for Digg.</p>
<p>Social Networks? These are the ones I find strange. I’ve dugg a few articles on Facebook, and I have no idea where they should go. Considering all these networks are valued in the billions and most of us spend a good portion of our day on these sites, shouldn’t they get a special section? Another strike.</p>
<p>Internet Search? Yahoo, Google, search, SEO, web 2.0 — these are all popular things to talk about on the Internet, but they don’t really have a proper home in the Digg category system. Why not have a “Internet” or “Web Technologies” category to put some of these?</p>
<p>I think the makers of Digg just choose a few random categories after a few beers one time and didn’t actually stop to consider how useful they actually were. Another popular article today on digg describes <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/02/05/digg-tech-section-analysis/">how there are less and less technology stories these day</a>. I’d wager it’s partly because nobody knows where the heck to put them.</p>
<p>I think the guys at Digg need to sit down and rethink some of these. If you have any suggestions, drop a line below.</p>
