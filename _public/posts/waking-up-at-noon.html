                    <p>Yes, today I briefly debated getting out of my bed at around nine, but decided sleeping in until noon was a better idea. I’ve had this recurring dream for the last few years that always feels so real. In it, someone (usually my friend Jeff) tells me about some university exam that I’m late for. Of course, everyone is completely prepared for the exam except for me. So I get to the exam and struggle for a good portion of my dream trying to come up with answers I don’t have.</p>
                    <p>For whatever reason, that one always seems real to me. When I wake up, I sometimes almost want to make a call to the university to make sure I’m not still enrolled or something.</p>
                    <p>The dream actually kind of mimics this one experience I had in university. I walked into a third year electrical engineering class not knowing it was the mid-term. It counted for 40% of the final grade, and I basically bombed the whole thing (since I hadn’t prepared for it at all). I talked to the prof after the test and told him that I honestly had no idea the mid-term was that day (I had missed a few classes due to being sick), and he said he’d think about what to do. At the end of the year, he counted my final exam for 90% instead of 50%, which basically let me pass his course based on that screw-up I had. He didn’t have to do that, but I’m obviously really glad that he did.</p>
