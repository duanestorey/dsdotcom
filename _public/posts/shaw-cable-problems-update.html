                <p>It’s been over a month of me trying to get some resolution to my problems with my Internet at home, and I’m happy to say that I’m a step nearer today. I imagine it’s due to everyone’s help on Twitter to be honest, since a few people made a few calls internally on my behalf. So thanks if you helped out.</p>
<p>I got a call a while ago from someone within Shaw who was informed of my problems. Right away, she said she was going to make some price adjustments to reflect the fact that my service has been sub-par. First, she lowered my monthly internet fee from $45/mo down to $10/mo for a full year. Second, she lowered the price on my digital cable box from $12/mo down to $2/mo for a full year as well. So if you do the math, that’s a savings of about $540 for the year. Not a bad gesture, and I’m thankful for it.</p>
<p>Right away though, I had to question why I was given a year’s credit for what I perceived to be not a very difficult problem. She informed me that she was going to investigate a bit more and find out when my service would be fixed.</p>
<p>Jump ahead 15 minutes and I got a call from a technical support person. He informed me that they were going to be doing some major bandwidth upgrades in my area, but not until after the Olympics. So to me, that basically means that the problem is that there’s not enough bandwidth servicing my area, which is the root cause of my problems (and likely other problems in my building).</p>
<p>So, I have to put up with at least another 4 – 6 weeks of problematic internet. But on the bright side I’ve been given a $540 credit essentially. So that’s where I’m at right now.</p>
