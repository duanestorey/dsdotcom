                <p>I picked up a Nexus pass about a year ago, mainly because I thought it would help with the amount of travelling I have been doing over the years. In theory, a Nexus pass will let you cross the US/Canada border without waiting in those huge line ups.</p>
<p>My first attempt at using my Nexus pass was by road. It’s a bit scary using it, because they have so many restrictions in place for the program. For example, if you do something wrong (like attempt to bring a person across with you who isn’t a Nexus card holder), they can revoke your privileges and take your card away from you indefinitely. Plus, they have a special book of custom paperwork for when you declare anything.</p>
<p>When you cross by road, they have a little machine that you have to hold your card up against which will read the RFID chip embedded in the Nexus card. I found it strange that the machine doesn’t make a beep or let you know it’s read your card. I spent about 20 seconds swiping it in various directions, thinking it might do something, but to no avail. So when I drove up to the lady in the booth, I felt stupid, like I had done something wrong. The machine actually did read the RFID tag, so she just waved me through and that was that.</p>
<p>The true value of my Nexus pass became apparent when I landed in Toronto the other day on my way to Charlotte. I had 90 minutes to clear the US customs side with my luggage and catch my flight. Unfortunately due to the increased security measures, there was a pretty massive line for customs. Thankfully I spotted a Nexus kiosk to the far right, so I decided to try that. There was no agent, which confused me, and made me think I couldn’t use that line. But a lady eventually came over and helped me out without giving me any attitude, which I was relieved for. After getting the machine to scan my retinas, it printed out a card for me which I was then to take to the custom’s agent at the exit.</p>
<p>I handed that guy my completed customs card (which I filled out moments before near the luggage rack) and the print out from the Nexus kiosk. At that point the agent asked me to produce my Nexus card, to which I replied I didn’t think I had it (in fact, I thought it was only required for land crossings). He told me that it was a program requirement to always have it on your person, and I thought I was gonna be screwed and canceled from the program. So I went through my wallet hoping it was there, and thankfully it was. I made my flight with just a few minutes to spare, and I’m sure I would have missed my flight had I not had been able to use the Nexus lane.</p>
<p>I had a similar experience landing in Vancouver — the customs line up was completely full. I had no flight to catch, but I was tired and hungover and I wanted to get home. I strolled over to the Nexus lane, did a retina scan, grabbed my kiosk receipt, waved it to an agent, and then handed it to the guy at the exit. Nobody said a word to me, and I was out of the airport in about 5 minutes instead of waiting over a half hour or more.</p>
<p>So, all three times I’ve used my Nexus pass it’s been a rather easy experience. I’m definitely glad I had it with me on this trip, otherwise I would have spent a few hours waiting in customs lines and also missed a connecting flight to Charlotte.</p>
