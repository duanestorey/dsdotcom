                <p>For many software developers, grabbing a can of soda is far more natural than grabbing a glass of water. At several companies I’ve worked at previously the employers even stocked the fridges with free soda. So when given a choice between grabbing a can from the fridge or getting a glass and going to the water cooler, often soda was chosen, especially in my case.</p>

<p>When I was younger I never gave much thought to how much soda I consumed, but definitely in the last few years I’ve been more conscious of just how many bottles of diet soda I go through. I remember a period of time where I would show up at work and pretty much drink a 2L of diet coke every day when we were developing a huge software product. Not only is that an awful lot of chemicals to put into one’s body, but it’s also a fairly large amount of caffeine.</p>
<p>I was reading some recent studies that seemed to indicate that aspartame wasn’t much better than sugar at preventing weight gain (in fact, several studies showed the opposite – that artificial sweeteners, through some assumed chemical means, can actually lead to weight gain). I used to use Splenda (which is assumed to be better than aspartame) but gave it up over a year ago because it caused me intestinal distress from time to time.</p>
<p>Giving up diet soda and artificial sweeteners is a pretty big undertaking for me. I have used artificial sweeteners for probably at least 10 years, and have been drinking soda consistently every day for close to 15 years. So I wasn’t really sure what the withdrawal process would be like, or if I would feel any better.</p>
<h3>Four Weeks Later</h3>
<p>It’s been about four weeks since I gave up both. I actually tapered my soda consumption down over about a week to minimize the withdrawal symptoms from caffeine (which I’m familiar with), so I wasn’t really worried about getting headaches or anything like that. Also, my plan wasn’t to give up caffeine, just soda – I still have been enjoying a morning coffee, I just haven’t been putting anything sweet into it.</p>
<p>I didn’t really notice anything for the first few days, other than craving soda from time to time. After a few days though I started getting some really bad heartburn/acid-reflux after eating. It got bad enough that I started taking daily antacids to help minimize the burning sensation. I suspect it’s because my body was adjusting to not having a daily intake of acid (soda contains carbonic acid), but I’m not entirely sure. I found similar stories by a few other people after googling it.</p>
<p>That lasted about two weeks, and thankfully now I am mostly heartburn free.</p>
<p>I haven’t really noticed much of a change from giving up the artificial sweeteners. My weight has probably gone up slightly, but that’s more likely associated with three weeks of binge eating and drinking since I was on vacation. I used to get some intestinal distress from time to time over the last few years, and I haven’t noticed that at all since giving both up, so it’s possible this is a positive affect associated with giving up the sweeteners.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed is that my sleep quality seems to be improved. I still wake up from time to time during the night, but I tend to dream far more often than I used to – I have even managed to mostly sleep through the night a few times. That’s definitely a big improvement from where I was a few years ago.</p>
<p>So in short, I’m happy that I’ve managed to give both artificial sweeteners and soda up over the last four weeks. I’ve always felt that consuming as much as both as I used to wasn’t a good thing from a health perspective, and now that’s something I no longer have to worry about.</p>
