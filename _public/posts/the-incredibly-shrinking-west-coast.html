                <p>Right before I left on my big adventure, almost everyone in my family was talking about going on a New Year’s diet. Years ago I was having trouble dropping a bit of weight, so I tried the Atkin’s diet when it was all the rage, and lost so much weight that it wasn’t even funny. Since that time I’ve studied up on why low carb diets work and have to come the one conclusion that refined carbohydrates are pretty evil. So while I’m not as lean and fit as I once was, I try to stay away from anything that causes big spikes in blood sugar and insulin, such as sugars, starches, flours, etc.</p>
<p>My mom started a diet in January, and as of last night she’s down around 10 lbs. My brother in law started a low carb diet, and he’s down around 14 lbs since January. My sister also has been riding the low carb gravy train, and she’s down 14 lbs last time I checked. Their friends are also doing a low carb diet, and I heard her one friend is down 20 lbs or so. Also, my buddy Duncan is on day 7 or so, and I think he’s down almost 10 lbs already.</p>
<p>So everyone back home appears to be shrinking away!</p>
<p>I’ve actually found it rather difficult here to watch what I eat. The super markets don’t really carry a lot of variety, and most of them are heavily based on bread and pasta. Other then steak, most restaurants are fairly carb heavy as well. But despite that both my pairs of jeans are looser than they were when I arrived, so I think I’ve lost a few pounds for sure.</p>
<p>But, congrats to everyone back home who is gradually shrinking away!</p>
