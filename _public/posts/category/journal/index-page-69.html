                    So yesterday, I met up with Jessica, Brennen, Kaedy, Michele, Jeff, Maya, Margo and Robbie, and the troop of dogs down in Steveston. In the old days, we started this day called “Friends Day”, where we would schedule in a day to hang out with our old high school friends. It sounds a bit lame, but with everyone’s time constraints, we found if we didn’t set aside time to hang out, it never happened.
So, even though yesterday wasn’t actually a friend’s day, we still managed to all meet out in Steveston for a few hours of hanging out. Brennen and Jessica recently had baby Kaedy, and Jeff ...

                    I just got back in from a nice evening out at a friend’s house, and I’m a bit tired. I was going to wait until the morning to write something, but now is probably as good as any.
Last night a bunch of us from work decided to get together and have a few beers. Unfortunately for me, a few beers turned into a pile of beers, a few rums, some wine, more rums, and finally some drunken blogging. All and all, a good night out, but I’m definitely getting too old to drink at that pace anymore.
I spent most of today lounging around my house, cleaning a bit, eating a bit, but for the most part I just ...

                    For some reason, I’m one of those people that rarely dreams. Or rather, I’m told, I rarely remember what it is I dream about, because apparently everyone dreams every night. Lately, I’ve found myself dreaming alot more. Sometimes the dreams are good, and I’m almost sad to wake up from them. But also, I’ve been having some nasty ones that I just can’t seem to shake.
When I was a kid, I had a bunch of work done on my teeth. They pulled four out to make some room, added some weird device to the roof of my mouth to help hold things in place, and of course, I had the token installation ...

                    So that stupid opacity problem has finally pissed me off enough to start to do something about it. There has to be a bug in my theme somewhere that’s doing it, but I haven’t been able to pinpoint it exactly. For now I’m switching to this theme, even thought it’s a bit buggy too (it’s only temporary)..
Actually, after disabling my theme and all plugins, the problem still exists in other themes.. I’ve only noticed it on my mac using Camino or Firefox, so I wonder if there’s something wrong there.. I don’t see the problem on a PC. Grr…

I’ve been up the CN Tower in Toronto and the Empire State Building and Rockafeller Center in NYC, but never up in the harbour center. So, last night I grabbed my camera and went to check out what Vancouver looks like at night. ...

                    So as most of you already know, in less than two weeks time, I’m going to be turning 30. No, I will not be starting any fires in Vancouver with the heat from my birthday cake, but I will be drinking no doubt in some bar somewhere with some of my friends. 30 is a really a strange birthday. As I approach it, I’m not really sad about it, but I am aware of the weight of it. I think it makes you look back on a pretty important chapter of your life and evaluate where you were, where you are, and hopefully where you’re still going. As Kris said a few weeks ago over beers, “a decade will do that ...

                    I’m pretty bagged, so this will be short. The flight leaving Heathrow was pretty much a complete clusterfuck. Apparently they were out of gates, so they just parked the 747 on the concrete a mile away and had to shuttle us all there in small groups.. We took off around an hour late.. About an hour into it, we had some pretty wicked turbulence, which for someone who hates flying basically unnerved me.
I popped a few sleeping pills when we hit altitude and managed to sleep for most of the flight home (surprisingly, because I had an aisle seat, and nobody asked me to get up so they could go to ...

A few emails have been passed around, and some of those have ultimately lead into online conversations via IM. What bothers me the most is that there’s this trend where people initiate a chat with you, and then are either too busy or too uninterested to spend time chatting. For example, this one girl will always IM me whenever she sees me and ask to chat. So I say sure.. Then, I spend 5 – 10 minutes waiting around for her one or two word response to every essay I ...

                    I approximately 24 hours, I’ll be stepping off a plane at Heathrow and rushing madly to see some of London before my connecting flight to Vancouver leaves in the early evening. I think I’ll probably only have about 3 and a half hours to see London, which I’m sure doesn’t give me much time to see very much. With the time constraints, it looks like I’m gonna shell out $100 for the express train that goes from the airport to Paddington Station near central London. From there, I’m really not sure what I’m going to do. It still seems like quite a haul to get to any of the attractions, ...

                    So my body decided that it would take a brief unscheduled break from sleeping at around 2am this morning.. I decided in that time I would throw a few photos up from yesterday (I don’t have that many). Oulu is pretty quaint so far, and I’m actually really eager to walk around and see some things (since the architecture looks really cool from my hotel window). I have to be on-site around 9 this morning (which means I need to get back to sleep), but afterwards I think my hosts are all taking me for dinner. For the most part, my digital SLR has been in my backpack most of the time. I took a few ...

                    When I lived in Ottawa, there were times when I used to get a little homesick and miss Vancouver and Chilliwack. When that happened, I was fortunate enough to stumble across a little website called KatKam.ca. It’s a live webcam that points into the direction of the evening sunset, only a block or so away from my apartment in Vancouver. To this day, I always religiously check it out from time to time when I’m out of town, just to see what I’m missing back home.
Here’s a shot of the sunset tonight that I missed. I’m heading to the airport now to fly up North. See you guys in about a week. ...

                    As most of my faithful readers now know, I’m currently in Helsinki, Finland with work. So far, I haven’t really seen much of this city, although walking around it was really awesome to see the old style buildings and narrow walkways. Someone asked me what the buildings were like, and I stopped myself before saying “they look European” since I guess that’s obvious.
Yesterday someone flew down from a little town called Oulu to hang out with me for the day and work on some stuff. One of the things that we discussed was me going up there for a few days, since there are more people up there ...

                    So I have a few minutes to kill here at Heathrow, so I thought I would write a quick blog entry. The flight from Vancouver to here was relatively uneventful. The guy next to me was sort of a prick, and unfortunately for me I don’t think he brushed his teeth yesterday, but I survived. I haven’t slept a wink, so I’m hoping I can sleep for an hour or two on the next flight to Helsinki. I think my next flight is delayed slightly, which means I probably won’t get into the hotel until around 10pm or so. One thing is for certain — I’m definitely going to be ready to have a nice long sleep ...

                    So, there are a million things I could say about this week, but I’m just too tired.. It’s been long, and I have to get on a plane in less than 24 hours to head to Europe.. It’s nearly 15 hours of travelling, and when I get there it will be cold and snowing.
I went out with Derek and Cisco for a few hours tonight, despite being completely bagged. We ended up at Salt in gastown (which is a really wicked wine tasting place). Here’s a shot of me tonight.

  
And here are a few more from the night. Special thanks to Van for lending me his 24-70 f/2.8L for the week in Europe. ...

                    This morning I came into work fully expecting to have a long day and then go home to bed. But it now appears I have to go home, do laundry, and pack for a last minute trip to Finland. Which is cool I guess, since I’ve never been anywhere in Europe before (which in itself is strange considering how much travelling I’ve done). It’s going to be a work related trip, so I probably won’t have too much time to relax, but I’m taking a few days at the end (I hope) to explore a little bit and see what it’s like. ...
