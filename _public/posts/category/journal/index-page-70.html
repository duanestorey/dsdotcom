By Friday I’m definitely going to be ready for a few drinks (or maybe a long nap).

                    So last week I decided that I was going to try and break my whole staying up late, getting up late routine and actually make an effort to go to bed early and get up early. For the most part (except for getting in a bit later today, which is excusable but unfortunately not bloggable), I’ve been keeping to a routine of hitting the sack around 11, reading on my laptop until 11:30 or so, and getting up at 7am.
Now, I have a queen sized bed. I’ve had one for years now I guess, ever since university. But the funny thing is, I will never ever be able to sleep like I have a queen sized bed. For the ...

                    I’m not sure why, but for some reason the opacity on my blog is messed up. Not always, just sometimes. In random places. I’ve gone over the CSS with a fine-toothed comb, and it looks fine, so I’m really not sure why it’s doing this. I’m gonna spend some time soon to try and fix it, because it’s really pissing me off. If you highlight a section of dim code, it automatically becomes bright and stays bright, so there’s almost some weird incompatibility going on with something I’m trying to do. It looks fine in Safari, just not anything Mozilla based. ...

                    So last night I headed down to the Alibi room for Keri’s 29th birthday party. I got the official invite via a myspace bulletin a while ago, and slotted it into my calender. The piece I apparently forgot I guess was the “RSVP via Email” thing at the bottom. So tonight, I got all dolled up, and headed down there for 10pm. Only problem was nobody else was there.. So, I got myself a drink, and waited. After an hour I realized there were a few holes in my original plan.. Unfortunatley, my cell phone was recently fixed, and I don’t have many numbers in there yet, so I had no way to contact any ...

A 43-year-old German decided to settle his imminent divorce by chainsawing a family home in two and making off with his half in a forklift truck.
Police in the eastern town of Sonneberg said on Friday the trained mason measured the single-storey summer house — which was some 8 meters (26 feet) long and 6 meters wide — before chainsawing through the wooden roof and walls.
“The man said he was just taking his due,” said a police spokesman. “But I don’t think his wife was too pleased.”
After finishing the job, the man picked up his half with the forklift ...

                    I met with my plastic surgeon this morning, and as I thought, we’re going to go ahead and do another surgery. The apparent source of my problem seems to be that the ledge that was supporting the implant ended up not being very stable, and the implant has collapsed slightly along with my eye. Also, there is slight herniation of some of orbital contents into my sinus near the back, which is most likely the source of my double vision.
The good news is that it should be nearly 100% fixable. They are going to put in another larger implant, and probably secure it using microscrews (sounds so exciting ...

For those people living in a cave, last November some guys tooled me pretty good outside a bar and ended up fracturing several bones in my face, including the orbital floor of my left eye. What this basically meant is that there was little to no support for my left eyeball in my left socket. That was November 4th.
On November 22, I went in for plastic surgery to correct the defect under my eye and put my eye back to its proper position. They do this by sticking in a plastic sheet that is meant to hold ...

However, that all changed sometime around 2003 when a prestigious medical school released a peer-reviewed study that basically showed Low Carbohyrate diets not only help people lose more weight, but also result in better blood-lipid profiles than their low-fat counterparts.
Since then, I’ve read countless studies on PubMed that basically indicate the same thing. However,

As I mentioned in an earlier posting, as of tonight, I’m going to try and get a good night’s sleep and wake up early during the week. That means bedtime for me tonight at 11pm, and up at 7am. I’m gonna shift my work schedule a bit so I’m home a bit earlier in the evenings. And get this, I’m even gonna go for a run in the morning. Also, although it’s going to be hard, I’m gonna abstain from drinking until my birthday and give my liver a chance to recouperate. ...

                    Wow, everyone’s getting older. This is a quick entry, because I just got in from Chilliwack and I’m a bit bagged. First, my mom’s birthday was on Friday, so a big happy birthday to her. Also, Jennifer, Cory, Robbie, Margo and Mike all turned 30 in the past few weeks. Tonight was also another Jen’s birthday out here in Vancouver. So, a big happy birthday to all of you.
Some of us met out in Chilliwack tonight for a dual housewarming / birthday party for everyone. Cory and Tanya’s new place is really awesome, and it was great to see some old high school friends again. ...

                    Well, my vacation is slowly coming to an end. It doesn’t really matter how much time you take off, for some reason it always seems to go by in the blink of an eye. Thankfully though, I got to do a few of the things I wanted to do — I spent my first weekend lounging around Vancouver and catching up on sleep. The next few days I spent in Seattle, seeing that city up close for the first time, and even making a few new friends along the way.
I originally opted against going to Mexico for this vacation, simply because it would be too much money. However, between my new laptop, some hotel bills, ...

                    Sometime in January, I thought I would finally throw some Google Adsense onto a few of my pages and see if I could make any cash at all. I didn’t really have any expectations going into it, which is good because I’m sort of been pleasantly suprirsed.
In January, my adsense revenue was around $7, which is almost enough to cover the hosting costs in one month. In Feburary, the adsense revenue was around $22, which puts me squarely into the black for hosting costs. It’ll be interesting to see what March holds, and how long it will take until I get that Google Beer Check.
I’ll keep everyone ...

                    I travel to the United States quite often with work. Maybe not as much as I used to, but for a while there I was down here every month or two, visiting California or other cool places. So, for the most part, I know what to expect in most states. I don’t even really think about it anymore really, I just hop on a plane and change a few of the subtleties when I talk to people (I go out of my way not to so Eh). However, the one that always trips me up is the word “Pop”.

Because in the US, most people don’t know what the hell Pop is. So whenever I say it accidentally, I always get that deer ...

                    I had a really good time in Seattle last night. On my way back from my big walking adventure, I saw a pub called “The Blarney Stone” and basically had to stop by to have one drink out of honour of my home town. While sitting at the pub, I tried my first (and probably last) Strongbow beer. If you haven’t had one, you definitely should at least once.. It sort of tastes like apple juice on steroids.
It was here that I ran into Sara and Alec and started my drinking adventure of the evening. I had made dinner plans with a friend around 8pm, so we did a pretty good job of drinking until then.. ...

                    One of the last conversations I had at Northern Voice was with Michael Klassen, and it was about how Microsoft had completely forgotten about the end-user. Sure, maybe they spent five years working hard to make a new OS that they hoped everyone would like, but the user-experience just isn’t there. Which is really the prime area where Apple excels — they listen to the end user, and make the experience simple and productive. Other companies simply want to focus on the “how” and not the “why”. Having a really elegantly coded application with a crappy user interface is just a waste of ...
