                    I had a guy come up to me at work today (yes, you know who you are) and complain because my blog didn’t look good in IE6. If you’re using IE6, and you’ve having problems, here’s what you should do:
Upgrade to a real browser!!! 
Seriously, Firefox is free and I believe so is IE7 now. I really don’t have the time to customize every theme for every browser. IE6 is old and it’s so not standards compliant it’s not even funny. Stop living in a cave and upgrade to something decent already. And if you don’t want to, then subscribe to my RSS feed and read my blog that way. ...

                    A while ago I wrote an entry about Megan Meier, a 13 year old girl who was driven to commit suicide by means of a fake MySpace user account.

A few minutes ago I read this article which indicates that no one involved in this tragedy will be prosecuted whatsoever.

St. Charles County, Missouri, Prosecuting Attorney Jack Banas said an 18-year-old woman posed as “Josh” on MySpace to find out what Megan was saying about a neighbor’s daughter.
The message said Megan was “mean” to her friends, Banas said.
“There is no way that anybody could know that talking to someone ...

                    Sorry for the lack of entries around here. I’ve been meaning to write something, but whenever I find a few minutes worth of time, nothing really comes to mind.
First, I’m on day three of new antibiotics. Good news is that I feel a lot better again, which is a big relief and a really good sign in terms of outcome. Unfortunately, because the dosage is a bit larger, I’m finding that some of the side effects, namely headaches, are a bit worse as well. Also, I find myself extremely tired. The last few nights I’ve come home with the intention on lying down for a few minutes, only to take up ...

Very cool man. Did you hold a golf club up in the air while taking these?
Also, I started a Flickr group for drunken/funny cell phone messages. If you have any, go nuts. ...

Jeff In Costa Rica
I actually sort of met Jeff in grade nine math class, when him and I would team up and blow spitballs into Margo’s hair instead of doing derivatives. Good times indeed.
And of course, today is also Keira’s birthday. I haven’t known Keira as long as Jeff, but in the time I’ve known her she’s been a good friend, and she’s obviously a great gal — I wish her the all best for her 27th birthday.

                    My iMac has been a bit slow when using photoshop or garageband, so today, after picking up Hesty from the airport, I stopped at NCIX and picked up some more memory for it.
When I got home, I actually had a hard time figuring out just where the memory went. I finally found out where — there’s a little panel on the very bottom of the iMac that comes off easily with one screw. After that, you just slide in the SODIMM chip and you’re up and running again in just a few minutes. Pretty slick, especially compared to how much trouble it was to upgrade the Mac Mini at work (I actually had to use ...

                    Today was a strange day. I woke up this morning and went down to the clinic to get the results of some tests I had done this week. If you’ve been keeping up with my saga, I somehow got a digestive infection when I was in the hospital with pneumonia a few months ago. It’s not contagious or anything – about 10% of people in the hospital get it after a week, and over 50% of people generally get it after four weeks in a hospital. You typically don’t get this unless your body is hit with a really hard broad-spectrum anti-biotic, which in my case was clyndamycin in the hosital. This type of ...

                    I currently have a package en-route to Toronto, and have been trying to locate where it is. I sent it priority courier with Canada Post, since that was the simplest option. Surprisingly, their “real-time” tracking number isn’t real-time at all, and basically has a 24 hour lag to it. So in the case of an over-night delivery (which I paid extra for), nobody will be able to locate the package until a day after it should have been delivered.
I just got off the phone from a lady at Canada Post, and her questions were the real-world equilalent of “is your computer on?” type tech questions. ...

                    So it’s weird. When I was about 19 years old, I picked up my first guitar, which at the time was a Fender Strat electric. Surprisingly, I didn’t really know how to play, but it was something I was always interested in doing so my mom surprised me and picked me up a guitar.
I spent the next few years pissing my roommates off by walking around my dorm room playing Green Day and whatever else was popular at the time. When I hit the age of about 25, I sort of just gave music up completely, probably because I didn’t really have much time and I wasn’t really making much progress.

                    Is it just me, or is facebook getting a little old these days? Except for the event planning thing, which I think is fairly useful, there’s not really a lot about it that I really think is that great anymore. And to be honest, I’m getting a little tired of saying ignore to things like the funwall, or turkey tossing and what have you. I know people are just having a little fun with it, but I’m just not that interested in alot of those things everyone is inviting each other with. It’s not really a big deal, as I don’t get enough of them to where it takes a lot of time out of my day, I ...

                    I just read this while surfing the internet – that in a comparison of Windows XP SP3 against Vista SP1, XP blew it completely out of the water:

Vista’s first service pack, to be released early next year, is intended to boost the operating system’s performance. However, when Vista with the Service Pack 1 (SP1) beta was put through benchmark testing by researchers at Florida-based software development company Devil Mountain Software, the improvement was not overwhelming, leaving the latest Windows iteration outshined by its predecessor.
Vista, both with and without SP1, performed notably ...

I think it turned out not bad, considering I hand held it. If I had an extender I could probably do an even better job. ...

                    Vancouver, being a coastal city surrounded by mountains, has one of the most moderate climates in all of Canada. The average temperature in the summer probably hovers around 20C or so, and in the winter, rarely drops below 0C. Last time I checked, only one out of every five Christmases in Vancouver is white.
And despite the relatively warm temperatures here, walking the streets of this city in winter you’ll see the homeless struggling to keep warm, often forced to cover themselves with newspapers, cardboard boxes, or whatever damp clothing can be found in the dumpsters. Every night, they find ...

From hereWindows Vista rated one of the worse products ever by CNET:

Any operating system that provokes a campaign for its predecessor’s reintroduction deserves to be classed as terrible technology. Any operating system that quietly has a downgrade-to- previous-edition option introduced for PC makers deserves to be classed as terrible technology. Any operating system that takes six years of development but is instantly hated by hordes of PC professionals and enthusiasts deserves to be classed as terrible technology.
Windows Vista conforms to all of the above. Its incompatibility with hardware, ...

                    As you can plainly see, I spent some time updating my blog theme the other day. One of the main problems whenever anyone does any web development is still unfortunately in the area of supporting multiple browsers. Usually a design that at first looks good in your development browser might look a bit weird in IE or another one.
It takes a lot of effort sometimes to make a site work in multiple browsers, something that should not be lost on those who visit sites frequently. For the most part, I’m lazy in this area. I generally target Sarfari and Firefox, and just sort of pray that it works in ...

                    I’ve posted a few times on this subject, but this is a new paper that’s hot off the presses. Once thought to help with weight loss, caffeine has recently been cast in a new light as actually contributing to weight gain. Even caffeinated diet pop can lead to weight gain, due to increased insulin secretion in the body.

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study with periods of 7 days and washouts of 5 days comparing caffeine with placebo capsules was conducted. Participants were 16 healthy adults aged 18 to 22 years with a history of caffeine consumption. Blood samples from ...
