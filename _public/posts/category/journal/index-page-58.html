                    This weekend in Vancouver is the annual Vancouver Fashion Week. I had the opportunity the other night to attend the opening bash down at Bar None in Yaletown. I had a really great time taking photographs and interacting with a lot of the local models and clothing designers.

  
There are events all weekend, so make sure to check out their main web site if you are interested in seeing some local fashion. I just got an email saying I was on the guest list for the swim suit portion today, so I may have to head out and check that out, even though I really don‚Äôt have much time this weekend.

                    Nearly one year ago today, four guys that I had never met before decided it would be a good idea to put my face through the plate glass window of a 7-11. Prior to that one moment in time, now forever etched into my memory, I was upstairs at the Railway Club in Vancouver, enjoying a few beers with some friends in celebration of their wedding earlier that night. Upon exiting the building, somewhere between catching a cab and eating a bag of nachos, I overheard these four guys harassing a bunch of girls just a few feet away from me.
People have told me after the fact that perhaps I should have just ...

But yesterday, I suddenly got the urge to go outside and shoot some photos in the afternoon, so that‚Äôs what I did. I didn‚Äôt have my SLR, so I just shot with my point and shoot, which is always rather depressing. No matter ‚Äì here are a couple shots of a surprisingly sunny Vancouver.

The giant duck I bought last year at Christmas  

I am Christmas fanatic. I love hanging out in malls and watching people, or sitting at home listening to Christmas music. Last year I left my tree up until April, just because it made me sad whenever I thought about taking it down.
I‚Äôve been known to buy random stuffed animals (including this huge ass duck) to give away to people during the holidays. There‚Äôs a Christmas moose I bought who now holds my door open in my room.
I once took part in several nationwide mathematics competitions, two of which I managed to obtain medals for (cue the ...

A Macbook Pro.

On West Jet, you have to pay if you want to watch a movie, but I figure I can kill a paperback in about 4 hours or so, so paying $5 to watch a movie isn‚Äôt that bad a deal.

Photo from here
A friend sent me an email this morning which basically talks about Vancouver being chosen for a new Apple store.

After years of speculation and anticipation, there is finally confirmation that that an Apple store will occupy a space inside the Pacific Centre Mall in downtown Vancouver (BC). The three-block indoor mall has been undergoing a long-term and extensive renovation that included demolition, construction and the juggling and moving of several retailers, along with the addition of new stores. ...

                    A few weeks ago I went down to the Bell Mobility store and asked how much longer I was shackled to their service. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs on the order of two more years, which means I really can‚Äôt get a iPhone and switch to Rogers (although, I‚Äôm still not sure that‚Äôs a great option either).
So tonight, while talking to Jason, he was telling me about his recent iPod Touch purchase. It‚Äôs basically the same as the iPhone, except it doesn‚Äôt have a camera or obviously a phone. But the user-interface is roughly the same, and it has Wi-Fi, so you can surf the web wherever you are.

                    Warning ‚Äî you‚Äôre probably gonna hear far too much information in this post, but I need to vent a bit.
Ever since being discharged from the hospital, I‚Äôve had some pretty bad digestive problems. It started with just your run of the mill diarrhea, but has slowly gotten worse over the last month. Lately I‚Äôve been waking up a bit crampy, and have to hit the bathroom fairly often during the day right now.
I spent the other evening searching on the internet, and finally pinned it down to antibiotic associated diarrhea, due mainly to the IV and oral antibiotics I had while fighting pneumonia:

                    Well, tonight I completed the update procedure, which went off with out a hitch. I‚Äôm currently back to 10.4.8, and so far so good. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll upgrade to 10.4.10, or wait for Leopard to come out next week and grab that. We‚Äôll see.
I also spent a bit of time talking to the Lacie drive support guys today. They basically said the drive was hooped and to take it back to Future Shop. So tonight, I went down, returned the Lacie drive, but instead of getting the same one, grabbed an LG drive (which said it didn‚Äôt support Mac). I figured it was more money, and I had all the system software ...

                    One of the pieces of technology I‚Äôve always thought was pretty cool was the new Lightscribe CD burners out there on the market. Prior to Lightscribe technology, the best a home user could really do was to be an ink-jet printer, print out a CD label, and then mess with putting it on in the right place. Some companies tried to make blank CDs with actual, printable surfaces, but those didn‚Äôt really work.
But somewhere, after a few beers, some genius came up with the great idea of simply etching the label on the CD using the laser built into the CD burner. And thus, Lightscribe was created.

                    Some guy on eBay bought that broken lens off me a few weeks ago. They paid promptly and everything seemed fine, so I boxed up the lens in the original box and shipped it to California.
I got an email today saying that they guy went and picked it up from the post office, only to find the box empty. So, somewhere along the way, somebody decided to help themselves.
Of course, since the lens was broken, I didn‚Äôt add any extra insurance to it. That being said, I think there‚Äôs at least $100 included by default. But now I have the hassle of trying to sort all this out and will probably have to refund ...

He‚Äôs pretty fun, kind of shinny, not too heavy, and he can nearly last a whole DVD without dying. But when he sleeps, he sometimes doesn‚Äôt wake up.

I put more ram in Mac, hoping to make him happier, but he‚Äôs still sad. When he crashes, he does it slowly to rub it in, slowly fading the screen from top to bottom until he‚Äôs gone. He used to do this once a month, but ...

                    Slight change of plans. I was originally going to go to Toronto on the 26th, but I‚Äôm going to go to Ottawa the week before for work. So, I‚Äôll be bouncing into Toronto on the 26th, but instead of coming from Vancouver, I‚Äôll be coming in on a flight from Ottawa. That will put me into Toronto several hours earlier, which should take a bit of pressure off with having to get downtown from the airport.

  
I‚Äôll be staying out in Kanata in a really great hotel called The Brookstreet Hotel, which just happens to be owned by Terry Matthews (whose company recently merged with ours). Apparently Terry ...

                    Today I made the long trek to work, but instead of having my head down with my iPod firmly attached, I decided (mainly because my iPod was dead) to keep my head up and look around. Being a single guy, my gaze routinely fell on cute girls and, to my complete disappointment, nearly all of them had a cigarette firmly attached between their fingers.

Now for some reason, I always thought Vancouver was a fairly healthy city. When I moved away in 2000, I don‚Äôt think a single person I knew smoked. And now, coming back, everywhere I look there are people who are puffing ...
