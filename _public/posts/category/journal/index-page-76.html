                    So, for those of you who have been following my blog entries over the last few weeks, you’ll know that I got injured outside of a bar on Sat. November 4th, was hospitalized, and have been slowly recovering since. It’s pretty sad that there are people out there who would do something like that. It seems there’s violence everywhere lately. If you turn on the TV, there’s always some news story about gang violence in Surrey, some beating in downtown Vancouver, some shooting at a nightclub. It never used to be this bad. In the old days you could open your mouth without worrying if someone was ...

                    For those of you who live in Vancouver, by now you’ve heard that there’s currently a water ban in effect for certain regions of the GVRD. You can read about this a bit more on Clay’s Blog. The actual reason why the water is “bad” is apparently because of turbidity. What this basically means is that there is a lot of sediment in the water, and for some people, this can cause some problems in the toilet department.
What’s a bit strange in all this is that there are lots of places in the world where turbid water is pretty common. Even in Saskatchewan, on my relative’s farm (where their ...

                    A few days ago, Brennen and Jessica had their first baby. What’s sort of interesting is that they had an ultrasound done to find out the baby’s sex, and were told it was going to be a boy. So, they got lots of boys clothes, painted the room blue, picked out names, etc. But, at the hospital, they were treated to a baby girl.
I popped by for a while today to see their currently unnamed baby girl. What a cutie.

                    So tonight Jeff and Michele invited me over to their place for dinner. It seems that lately everyone is cooking for me, which is really cool, because I just am not in the mood for cooking lately. I’ve been really tired lately, and I end up sleeping most of my free time. After dinner at Jeff’s, I was sitting on their couch admiring their new 40 some inch LCD screen, when I woke up about 30 minutes later while a movie was playing. I guess I had just passed out.
What’s kind of cool is that I think I’m going to get to be in Jeff’s wedding party — again.

You see, they got married in Costa ...

                    So, about a month ago I decided that I was going to pull my guitar out of retirement and try to get better at it again. I’ve been playing for about ten years now, but realistically I only spent about a year or two actively playing it, so I really can’t play anything tha complicated. But I decided I’m going to try and get better.
So, I’ve pulled out all my recent music and have been trying to play it on my guitar. The only problem is most of the stuff I have been listening to is rather tough to play for me on the guitar. Take John Mayer for example. He’s a really good guitarist, inspired ...

                    So, I had my appointment today with the plastic surgeon. First, the bad news — it will take between three and six months before I’ll be able to feel my face again. Also, the double vision at the extremities needs to clear up on its own. If it doesn’t I need to go back in a few months and go see an eye specialist.
Now the good news — although my cheekbone *has moved*, it’s only moved about 1mm or so (inwards I believe). So, they gave me the option of having surgery (which amounts to having three incisions — one in my mouth, and two around my eyes — and also having titanium plates ...

I was sitting on the couch watching TV, when suddenly I felt a sneeze coming on. It really freaked me out, because I knew at that moment just how painful a sneeze would be. I couldn’t stop it, and before I knew it my teeth were bashing together from the sneeze, and my whole head was in agony. That happened about three more times, and by the end of it I thought I was going to pass out. Luckily it hasn’t happened again.
The swelling in my eye is down quite a bit, so my eye ...

Unfortunately, something happened on the way home that night that sort of changed the focus of this blog entry. After the wedding, a few of us decided to go down to the Railway Club for a few more drinks. After it was over, everyone slowly made their way into cabs and headed back home. I was the last guy to get one, so since it was proving difficult to get a cab, I made my way into the store right beside the Railway Club and got some food. After I came out, I overheard three guys bugging three ...

                    I was going through some old things tonight, and I came across a few tokens of my past that sort of reminded me how I first got into computers a long time ago. It all started back in Chilliwack, years ago, when my dad got picked up a Commodore 64. That was the first “real” computer that we had access to, and we both got into gaming. Chilliwack was pretty ahead of the curve, and they even opened up their own computer club that my dad and I dropped in on from time to time (oh yeah, we were cool). Not long after, I got my own C64, complete with the “fastload” cartridge, bringing game loading ...

                    My dad sent me this link today: Oaxaca Crisis. That’s really near where I’m going in a few weeks. It seems whenever I go somewhere, there’s always some big crisis that happens right before. When I went to Cuba a few years ago, our plane was turned back halfway in the air because of Hurricane Michelle.
Hopefully things get better for the people down in Oaxaca soon. ...

                    Last night was Mel’s big halloween social down at the Marine Club. It was a great time, and everyone appeared to like the beer. Here’s a link the some of Mel’s photos from the night here. She also had a scary faces contest during the night. Here’s mine (photo by Mel):


A funny thing happened on the way home. I realized that being a national icon is hard work, and after a night of dancing, I thought the Statue of Liberty could use some poutine. So, I stopped by Fritz and ordered some food. While standing in line, I look over and Elvis Presley is calling my name. Him and and Marilyn Monroe ...

                    I spent a half hour tonight getting caught up on medical research. I try to read pubmed from time to time just so I know when my doctor is pitching crap to me or not.
This was an interesting recent study comparing diet composition with weight loss. I’m always surprised when I read research, because so much of it is bad, and the author’s never want to go out on a limb and say what their research really means. For example, in the study I just linked to, 57 people went on diets, half on one type, half on another. The average weight loss by group one was 5.7kg, while the average for group two ...

                    So tonight I had originally planned to come home and work on some costume ideas.. However, while on my way home, Hesty stopped me and thought it would be a good idea to go grab a drink or two at a pub on the way home.. Thinking I wouldn’t be out very late, I tagged along.. However, Adrian then invited us down to the Wild Coyote for a cool Russian Party. Since I’m part Ukrainian, and I happen to think Eastern European girls are pretty cute, it didn’t take us long before we wer down there having a few drinks. Good news is that cute Ukrainian liked me, so she took my number and wants to go ...

                    So, I have bounced between a couple of ideas for Halloween this year, humming and hawing about what I was going to be. I woke up this morning and realized that I still didn’t have a costume. Frantic, I started scanning around my living room for ideas.. And that’s when it hit me.. on my floor, in a nice picture frame, was a picture I took in New York back in July.
A picture of the Statue of Liberty.
So, I spent this afternoon putting together a costume of the Statue of Liberty. I made a funky torch out of my camping flashlight, and the hat thing out of a beer hat I had lying around..I think ...

                    I’ve been getting a lot of notices from Air Canada’s Aeroplan recently. Apparently they have changed their policy so that air miles accumulated on airlines actually expire after a period of time. What that means is my airmiles from a long time ago are going to start disappearing off my statement in the near future.
So, I guess the easiest way to get around that is to cash them in sometime in the next 6 months and go somewhere. I don’t really have a lot of vacation at work, so I’ll probably just have to go somewhere for an extended weekend. I have 40,000 miles right now, which will basically ...
