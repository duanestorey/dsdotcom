                    On Friday night a bunch of us from work took Jari and Seppo out for one last night on the town in Vancouver. Since we basically accomplished everything we set out to do this week, we started drinking at around 4pm Friday afternoon at work. From there, we made our way to the Yaletown Brew Pub for dinner and some more drinks. I wasn’t really sure what these guys would like to see (apparently at the end of the night it turns out they kind of wanted to see a strip club, affectionately called “The Titty Bar” in Finnish), so I sort of did a mini pub crawl with them. After YBC, we decided to hit ...

                    Last night I decided to go down to the little store downstairs and get myself something to drink. As I was leaving my apartment, I realized that for some weird reason I couldn’t lock my door from the outside. Locking it from the inside is difficult, but not impossible. But I can’t for the life of me manage to lock it from the outside.

So basically, I’m stuck at home until I can figure out a way to get it fixed. The obvious answer is to call a locksmith and get him/her to come fix it. But it’s Sunday, which probably means it’s going to be a major pain in the ass to sort out. I’ve been ...

                    Tonight I had the unusual desire to spend some time working on my blog. The last theme that was up was 100% written by me entirely from scratch. And while I really liked it when it went up, I’ve grown a bit tired of it. So for now, I’m using the Balance theme from the internet. It has a lot of cool Ajax features, and even supports Gravatars in the blog comments. If you don’t have a gravatar, I suggest you head on over and get one.
So instead of reinventing the wheel with my own theme, I think my current plan is to spend some time extending this one with some of the cool features I’ve been ...

                    Most people who know me nowadays would probably be a bit surprised to learn that I used to be a big literature buff, particularly with old english poetry. I guess it all started back around grade 10. I had done pretty well in school, and had been recommended to take advanced placement calculus and physics. Because of that, and of my high marks in english I guess, I was put on a list that recommended I be enrolled in a new AP Literature class at our school. So for kicks, I said “why not”?
And to be honest, looking back, it’s probably the class I enjoyed the most. I studied some of the greats ...

I still haven’t finalized all the insurance papers that will let me get a refund on the first pair, but at least I’m no longer without a pair of glasses. The ladies at the eyeglass center were nice enough to remind me to remove them whenever I decided to step out, have a few drinks and then fall down.
Unfortunately, in the process of falling the first time, I seemed to have gotten the world’s largest splinter. To make it worse, it entered at the tip of my finger, and proceeded to go down the length of ...

                    Ever since my injury in November, I have spent quite a bit of time in hospitals, doctor’s offices, and medical clinics. Part of those visits usually involves some interaction with medical students.
And while I’m certain that there really are good medical students out there who are passionate about helping people and eager to learn more in their field, almost every single medical student I’ve encountered has been both arrogant and misinformed, a deadly combination when you’re trying to help people who are sick or have undergone significant trauma.

I spent tonight walking down the beach with my camera snapping photos. The sunset photo below was one of a few that I ended up liking. One thing that I’ve noticed lately is that everyone I know that uses flickr, including me, seems to be on a bit of a break. I used to log in every night and see tons of new photos from everyone. Now, I can go days without seeing any changes in photos from ...

Watcharaporn Boonmak, 26, was ambushed by gunmen as she rode her motorcycle through a Muslim village in Yala, one of the three southern provinces roiled by three years of separatist insurgency in which more than 2,000 people have been killed.
“She might have been shot in the stomach before they set fire to her and her motorcycle,” a Yala police officer, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters by telephone.
One of her relatives told Reuters that witnesses at the scene heard Watcharaporn, a garage clerk, screaming ...

                    So, I was reading my buddy Joey’s website when I stumbled across a recent article of his. It shows a video of him riding a bike when he was a kid, and of course, in typical kid fashion, hurting himself. When I saw this, I was reminded of a similar accident I had when I was a kid. My sister tied my wagon onto the back of her bike and was pulling me up and down Wiltshire street in Chilliwack. I was having a great time, probably because I was wearing my bright green boots and my tacky overalls. Out of nowhere, my sister hits the brakes. Unfortunately, the wagon didn’t have any way to stop, so ...

                    I’m a gadget whore, plain and simple. If you were to come into my apartment, you would probably be surprised how many useless techie gadgets I have. From my iPod stereo adapter to my Satellite radio in my car, I just love things the beep and glow. This isn’t a recent development either — when I was a kid, my parents always made sure I had some type of computer around to play with. My first experience in the realm of engineering came probably around the age of 12 when I decided it would be a great idea to dismantle my entire commodore 64 and it’s disk drive using a screwdriver — I did ...

                    For those of you who read regularly, you’ll know that I’ve been striving to wake up earlier in the morning, and get home from work earlier in the evening. For the most part, throughout my life, I have been a night owl. I have always found it rather peaceful at 1 or 2am in the morning, and used to get some of my best school work done then. However, in the last little while I’ve found it rather depressing getting home at 8pm, eating dinner, and basically not having very much “regular” time to do normal things like go to movies or just hang out with friends.

For the most part I’ve now ...

                    As I mentioned in my last post, I somehow managed to lose my glasses at Honey on my birthday night. Since I only had them for two days, I was obviously a bit bummed about what happened to them. However, both Brennen and Hesty suggested I call my Visa company (since I used my Visa to do the purchase) and see if there is anything they can do.
So surprisingly, my Visa policy actually has a clause that covers loss or damage for any new item for a period of 90 days. What that means is that they are going to give me a full refund on the purchase price.
I just called the optometry place and put in an ...

                    Well, it’s now official — not only am I officially 30, but I have also survived my 30th birthday party. Thanks to everyone who came out to enjoy a few beers. In my case, thanks to all the shots, I drank way more than I’m used to. While I had a great time, unfortunately I slipped down the stairs at Honey and lost my glasses long enough for a few people to step on them. So, apparently I’ll be visiting the eyeglass store this week to put in a new order.
Thanks everyone who popped by.

I have a meeting with my plastic surgeon on Friday, and from there I’ll know when I’ll have my second ...

                    Well, in just a few hours, yours truly will be turning 30. I originally set out last night to write something memorable, and spent a few hours writing a blog entry that I hoped would detail the last ten years of my life. However, upon waking up this morning, I realized that it wasn’t really what I wanted to say, probably because I think it was heavily influenced by the events of the last six months.
The truth is, this has probably been the hardest year of my life. Between a big breakup, that assault in November, a surgery and some other personal things in my life, it was really quite a challenge ...

                    Yesterday, partly by chance, and later by design, I found that I didn’t log into an IM client for nearly the entire day. No Jabber, no Yahoo, no Windows Live or whatever they are calling it now — just me, alone with my machine.
And it was everything that I thought it would be.
Now let me just tell you what a typical day is like for me on IM. I have, quite easily, well over 100 people on my IM client. A small percentage of these are personal (friends and family), but without a doubt, the majority are business related. During a typical work day, I’d say 70 of them or so are online and working ...
