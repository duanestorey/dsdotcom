                    I had a meeting with my plastic surgeon today to talk about the last surgery I had. It’s been a little over five months now, so in terms of results, everything should be stable.
In my opinion, the position of my eye, while better, is still not perfect. In addition, I still have double vision in the top-left version of my visual field. My plastic surgeon did a few simple tests on me, mainly involving looking at my eye and tracking its movement using a finger.
At least to my surgeon, the results are acceptable and do not warrant another surgery. For now, I have a few referrals to some eye doctors ...

                    As I mentioned in my last blog entry, the other day I had a chance to photography my first wedding. All in all, it was a pretty rewarding experience.
The day started at around 11am for me and Hesty. We suited up, did some last minute charging of equipment, and then got in touch with the groom. Normally the photographer heads over to the where the bride is getting ready for some photos, but Kim’s aunt wanted to do those ones, so I was relieved of that duty.
We met Mike and the groomsmen down at the Holiday Inn in Langley to get ready. In true Chilliwack style, Mike, instead of hopping in the ...

                    Last night I had the chance to photograph the wedding of two of my old friends. It was a great experience, and I’m fairly satisfied with how the photos turned out, considering how dark it was both outside and inside the reception area.

  
I’ll do a full write-up on everything I learned about shooting a wedding, but right now I have a turkey to eat. I shot over 1000 shots at the wedding, and I’ve slowly been sorting them. I put about 150 or so of them on Flickr if anyone is interested. There are still more I have to process and put together, but there’s enough that it’s fairly good representation ...

I’m really glad I got a chance to try out a bunch of photos in a real setting, because I made a few mistakes that I likely won’t make tomorrow. I’m gonna keep this short, because I still have lots to do. Next blog entry will probably be Sunday after everything is over. ...

I tried to go to the clinic tonight for a check-up, but there was over a two hour wait, so I’m going to try again in the morning on my way to work.
Also, this weekend I’ll be attending Mike and Kim’s wedding as the primary photographer, which is both exciting and a bit stressful. It’s not hard to grab a camera and take a bunch of photos, but it is hard to be prepared, both technically and mentally, ...

                    Last night, out of sheer boredom, I drove down to Future Shop and picked up Season one of Heroes, on HD-DVD.

Rebecca and John have been recommending this series to me, so I figured I would just go along with their word of mouth and pick it up.
I’m about half way through season one already, and so far I think it’s pretty good. A few of the characters I find a bit annoying, but the Tokyo guy who can bend space and time is always entertaining, as well as the guy who can read minds. I’m anxiously awaiting the Heroes to step up and start being cool, but maybe that’s what season two is all ...

So, you can imagine my surprise when, after getting out of the hospital and checking my eBay page, I noticed that the sucker had sold for $260.
I was completely clear in the description that the item doesn’t work, and that it would require major repair. But still, I’m completely astounded that someone would pay that much for what I perceive as basically a paper-weight.

The whole episode that led me to head to the hospital is as follows. On Saturday night I was finding myself really short of breath at home. Plus, no matter what medication I took, I just couldn’t seem to get my fever to come down. I hit a point when it hit 39C and my heart rate wouldn’t settle down and I thought to myself that something was ...

It’s been really great. They made me a meal, looking after me, did my laundry, and tried to do what they could to make me feel better. I went to bed, and actually had a pretty decent sleep. Unfortunately, I had a really large fever upon waking up today, and realized that something wasn’t really right.
I went down to the walk in clinic with Marty, which was a challenge ...

                    Is it just me, or was this one of the shittiest summers we’ve had in a long time? It seems like anytime I looked out my window in the morning with thoughts of doing something outdoors it was either cold or rainy. Obviously today is no exception.

Interestingly enough, while down in the Dominican Republic, most people there said the same thing — that this was one of the worst summers they can remember. I’m fairly certain the UK set a rain record this summer, based on something I heard and read while down in the Caribbean.
Unlike most of my friends, I’m not particular ...

                    Years ago, while looking for something to read along the lines of fantasy, I encountered the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. Jordan’s writing style is similar to Tolkien’s in that he takes great efforts to relate back stories and flesh out all his characters. While I lost interest in the series a few years ago (mainly due to my impatience for waiting for a book to be written), I did enjoy it tremendously when I first started.
Today, Robert Jordan passed away from complications from primary amyloidosis. Rest in peace. ...

                    Years ago, had I gone to the dentist with a chip in my tooth, they probably would have just polished it up a bit with the grinder and sent me home. Thankfully, with all the advances in material science, that is no longer the case.
I had a scheduled cleaning with my dentist today, and just in passing I mentioned the chip in my tooth that I somehow obtained in Ottawa. It wasn’t really that visible, and mostly was just a small annoyance to me (since it had a different texture when I rubbed my tongue along it). However, once he took a look at it, he told me that he would fix it for me using ceramics.
So, ...

                    One of my favourite movies of all time is a science fiction flick called “Dark City.” Brennen and Jeff took me to it at the UBC theatre years ago, and we were all blown away. Surprisingly, not many people have watched it or even heard of it. When it came out, Roger Ebert took notice and gave it four stars, even going on to compare it to Pulp Fiction in terms of its cinematic perfection.

If you haven’t seen it, I strongly suggest that you check it out. The row boat scene near the end is one of my favourite all time scenes in any movie I’ve watched (along the lines of the DeNiro – Pacino ...

                    I apologize for being a day late on this, but I’ve been a bit busy with a few things. Yesterday, as most people know, was the sixth anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Last year on that day, I was flying into Logan airport in Boston, which was a bit strange considering some of the highjackers left Logan that morning six years ago and put a plane into the World Trade Center.

                    It’s been a busy few days, so I thought I’d let everyone in one what’s going on. First, I’ve been throwing together a photography website, using some input from some friends. It’s looking good so far, and hopefully it will be done tonight or tomorrow night.
In terms of my lens, my insurance company contacted me and has cut me a cheque for the 70-200mm f/2.8L, so hopefully I’ll have a new one of those this weekend or early next week. I’m also buying a used 24-70mm f/2.8L tonight (I hope, assuming my bank machine gives me enough money), which rounds off my kit rather nicely. That will ...
