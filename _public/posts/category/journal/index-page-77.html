                    So, yesterday night Cisco and I met up with Cullen at Gotham for dinner. Gotham is arguably Vancouver’s finest steakhouse, and despite living here for 10 years or so, I had never been there. Steaks start at around $40, and go up to the $50 Porterhouse that I had. Apparently they cook them in some funky infrared chamber that can cook a steak in around 6 minutes. Anyways, it was fun, but I’m not sure my steak was worth $50.
Afterwards, we met up with Jason, Ecker and Derek for a few drinks. It was a fun night, but I wasn’t looking forward to the 8am conference call in the morning.
Oh, another ...

                    So this morning I woke up, hangover free, and decided I should get outside and take advantage of the nice weather we were having. I called Dustin up and said “hey man, let’s go do the Grouse Grind,” to which he responsed: “are you *(#%#ed in the head?” After a few minutes, I managed to convince him that we should go hiking. I had never done it before, although I used to do a bunch of hiking in the old days (Lake Garibaldi has a similar elevation gain). I wasn’t too worried about making it to the top, but I was a bit worried about my knee. A few years ago some friends and I did the ...

                    I was in a bit of a hurry this morning, so I thought I would save some time by using my microwave for a change. I cooked a few eggs up last night (hardboiled) so that I’d have a little snack in the fridge when I got hungry. But, unfortunately, cold hard boiled eggs just don’t really do it for me. I figured — why not just warm those puppies back up in the microwave before I eat them? Sounds like a good idea. So, I deshelled them and stuck two eggs in the microwave.
They weren’t even in there that long really, just like 45 seconds. The first waited until I had opened the door to take him ...

Usually while I watch a movie at home, I’ll surf the net and investigate random things that spark my interest while watching the show. So, I was surfing to see what happened with all the people from the movie since 1985. I found a funny youtube video of Marty McFly’s dad (Crispin Glover) from an interview on David Letterman. It’s almost painful to watch. ...

Even though I did my thesis defense in the summer, there was still some red tape to jump through with regards to having all the correct paperwork in order. I was working the phones a bit last week trying to get everyone to agree that I was allowed to graduate in the November ceremony. What made it hard for me is that you have to return your keys to the UBC security office before your grades are released to the graduate committee. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen my keys in several eons, and the procedure in this event isn’t clearly ...

                    I stumbled onto Strongbad again today. He’s a really funny character someone made out of flash. If you haven’t checked him out before, and you have a few hours to kill, definitely take a look. Some of them are pretty hilarious. ...

                    Last night, Neil, Ken and I started the evening down at Earl’s on Robson street. They had some good martini specials, and even though I don’t like martinis, I managed to down one before I was forced to switch to beers. After we were slightly drunk, we made our way up to Doolins for another drink, and then I headed over to the Morrisey with Tiffany and her friend Jenn. I had a really great time hanging out with them, and we finished the night with three jumbo things of poutine down at Fritz on Davie.
I woke up rather late in the day, sometime around 1pm or so, had a shower, and then loaded ...

                    An update from spaceweather:
HARVEST MOON: Tonight’s full moon has a special name–the “Harvest
Moon.” It is the full moon closest to the northern autumnal equinox.
Long ago, before electric lights, farmers relied on the Harvest Moon to
light up their fields at night, allowing them to harvest autumn crops
even after sunset.
The Harvest Moon of 2006 is a big one–almost 12% wider than some full
Moons we’ve seen earlier this year. Why? Because the Moon is near
perigee, the side of the Moon’s lopsided orbit that comes closest to
Earth.
When the Harvest Moon rises tonight, go outside and ...

                    I remember I was complaining a while ago that September was going to be a brutal month, and that I’d be glad when it was all over.. I hardly even realized we were into October until today (shows how little attention I pay to dates), but I guess that means I’m in the clear. This is a pretty relaxed month in terms of things going on for me (which is a nice change), but November more than makes up for it (a stag, a wedding reception, and a trip to Mexico are the highlights next month).

The climax of this month will undoubtedly be Halloween. There are some bets floating around work, and for sure ...

                    Tonight Chris is heading back to the Duck to regain his honour. In case you weren’t around to follow the last time he went to the duck, you can read about it here. Needless to say, the Duck outdid the poor guy last time, but this time Chris swears he’s going to demolish ten jars of their sludge. Jeff Giddens will be going along for the ride, so it should be a good time. I’m staying out of this one, because drinking ten+ beers doesn’t seem like a good way to drop a few pounds in my opinion, but I’ll write about it tomorrow. ...

                    After watching Clay kick some ass at the Marine Club the other night, I decided to go home and wipe the dust off of my guitars and play a bit.. It’s funny — I used to play all the time, but for some reason I rarely pick them up anymore.. I think part of the reason is that I just don’t like either of my guitars. My acoustic was just a cheap piece of garbage I picked up in Chilliwack when I was about 20 years old (it’s not bad to take camping, since you really don’t care what happens to it), and my electric needs some TLC in the electronics that I just don’t have time for (it has developed ...
