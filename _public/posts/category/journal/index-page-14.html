My favourite shot so far is this one of Kathleen Higgins.

                    I’m about to get in the car and head out to Surrey. Jessie Farrell is headlining a charity event in Surrey called Basic’s for Babies. JRFM gave me a photo pass for the event, so I’m going to help out the cause by heading down and taking some photos of the event.

The show starts at 7:30pm, so I’m hoping to get there a bit early and figure out the logistics of taking photos in a seated concert venue. I’ll post a few photos tomorrow most likely. ...

                    As I’ve mentioned in previous posts, I’ve seriously been considering doing a bit of travel. Part of that is complicated by my desire (at some level at least) to purchase an apartment sometime soon. I met with a realtor today to go over some listings in the area, and am slowly transitioning from passive looking into active looking. I’m really not sure of my timeline yet if I were to buy something, but probably sometime in the next 3 to 6 months.
I’m also seriously debating heading to Serbia for a few months in the spring or summer. My friend Milan lives in a little town called Novi Sad, ...

                    It doesn’t happen very often, but today was one of them. The main reason I was frustrated today is because more and more people seem to be treating each other (or at least me) as simply a marketing target. I used to get inquiries on my site of a personal nature via my contact form. That still happens, and I always enjoy that when it happens (in fact, I think that’s one of the biggest positives about blogging — being exposed to and forming relationships with people you may never meet), but more and more I’m getting random press releases from Vancouver marketing companies and other firms ...

                    With the economy still kind of in the toilet and Christmas just around the corner, many food banks are finding that their coffers just aren’t as full as they used to be. Recently in Chilliwack there was a big food bank drive to try and remedy some of that. While many people have the luxury of being able to afford a nice Christmas dinner at home with their families, not all of them do.
To that end, Dale and I have put together a Food Bank Drive where the proceeds will go towards the purchase of many non-perishable items that will hopefully make Christmas a bit brighter for a few families. For ...

I have never been on a two week vacation before, and it’s strange coming back again and trying to fire the engines up again, especially when the engines have been soaked in beer for two weeks.
I’m down at my local Starbucks in Vedder Crossing here trying to get everything in order so that I can hit everything hard again starting tomorrow. I started the evening with 400 messages in my inbox, and am down to around 15 now, which is a nice improvement. Once my inbox gets past about ...

                    Everyone keeps asking me if there’s going to be another WordCamp Whistler this year. Unfortunately the answer is no (at least for the January – March period), not because there’s not enough interest (in fact, many people approached me during the social last year and said what a great time they had, and how they wanted to do it again), but because the 2010 Olympics are happening around the same time, and the logistics of that event will basically make it impossible to pull off this year.
So while I make no promises, perhaps there will be a late 2010 version or and early 2011 version of WordCamp ...

A couple of times I sat by the pool, staring through my book and thinking about things back home, about the last year, about my life, about the future. It’s really hard to believe that it’s been nearly a year since I packed up my things in Vancouver and headed back to Chilliwack.

Jump ahead a few days later, and the TV was full of information about his alleged affairs.
Nobody is perfect, and everyone slips up from time to time. That said, when two people step up to that alter and proclaim their love for each other, it really is something that I believe shouldn’t be taken ...

                    Yesterday was a long day. I left the resort at around 11am, which is 7am PST, and spent the next 14 hours or so travelling back home.

The flight to Vancouver was a little over and hour, and then my dad and I headed back to Chilliwack, arriving around 11:30pm I believe.
It was around 31C when I left Punta Cana, and around -2C when I got back to Chilliwack, so obviously that’s a pretty noticeable temperature difference. I had a really good sleep in ...

Dale has one more day on the resort, and then he’s heading home. Not exactly ideal, but it was hard to align Vancouver and Toronto with the flights. We all had a really great time on the resort and forged a few new great memories.

                    Today is day #13 down here in the Caribbean, and I noticed that the date was December 1st this morning. I gotta say, it’s pretty hard to take December seriously when the humidex is 40C and there’s not a cloud in the sky. This is probably the first December where I’ve ever been away on vacation, and it’s a bit surreal to be honest.
After two weeks here, my clothes are starting to smell a bit like ass. I was hoping to use the laundry service here (where they pick stuff up in your room and bring it back, hopefully within a few days), but I just didn’t trust it enough. So today I filled ...

                    It’s hard to believe that I’ve been down in the Caribbean for 11 days now, but that’s how the math works out. I woke up this morning and spent a few moments trying to figure out what day of the week it was, since it’s pretty easy to lose track.
Sara made it home ok, and Dale and I have been working on some BraveNewCode stuff since she left. Yesterday we spent most of the day in the room, Dale designing away and me coding away. We’re keeping the lid on most of the things we’re working on, but lots of cool things should be coming down the pipe.
The wireless here has proven to be a pretty ...

                    Quick update. Right now Rebecca and John are in the air, or about to land. This is officially day 8 here for me, which means there are fewer days ahead than there are behind. We’re all having a great time here, and have spent most of our days reading and swimming by the pool.

The other night I ventured off the resort and ended up at the Hard Rock cafe in Punta Cana. I met up with a few Vancouverites and we all went to a dance club until about 5am or so in the morning. I stumbled back into my room around 6am, and passed out for the better part of the day. That was the first night I hit the sauce, ...

                    I woke up late today, not that I’m really keeping track of the time or anything. I was originally gonna stroll down to the gym when I woke up, but slept a bit later than I normally do so I skipped the gym and the morning buffet. I met Dale and Sara by the pool for a few hours of reading, a bit of snack bar love, and then ultimately made it down to the gym for a bit of a mini workout.

The days here seem to go fairly quick, even though we don’t really do all that much. Most of the time we all just sort of relax by the pool or the ocean, and the days are split up with a meal here and there or ...

                    What else can you say, really? It’s quite gorgeous here. Strangely enough, I’m sort of adverse to massive amounts of heat, but for some reason the temperature here seems about perfect. Sure, it gets a bit hot during the day, but nothing a few beers and a dip in the pool can’t fix. And in the evenings the temperature drops enough to toss on a pair of jeans and chill in the lobby bar for a few hours.

I’ve been going easy on the alcohol since I arrived, partially because I haven’t been feeling 100%, and partially because I’m not 22 any more. But today was a fairly fun, alcohol involved ...

                    About half-way through my flight the other day I went to the bathroom and really wasn’t feeling good. I really have no idea what it was, but my stomach was pretty upset and I was feeling a bit achy. Shortly after writing my blog posting yesterday, I ended up feeling pretty worse, and went to my room to curl up in bed. I passed out around 8pm or so, and slept until almost noon this morning (unfortunately, a rather unrestful sleep since my stomach was keeping me up).
So I’m not sure if I caught something on the plane, or possibly ate something that didn’t agree with me (which I kind of doubt, ...
