                    So, I had almost completely forgotten that the Trailer Park Boys were in town this week. My friend Kris met them while he was at SXSW a few weeks ago and had a few drinks with the guys. He had said they were coming to town shortly, but it had slipped my mind until the end of the day today.
Since I figured that the Robson’s Chapters is on my way home, I swung by with my 70-200mm lens and decided to snap a few photos of the guys. I was hoping Kris or Robert would have been around so I could have gotten a quick intro (Mike Smith, or Bubbles, used to be part of a band I once listened to called Sandbox ...

                    Canon has noticeably lagged in releasing new DSLRS, especially on the higher end versions. To their credit, they did a big upgrade to the Digital Rebel line earlier this year with the Rebel XTi. This is a great camera that improves on a few areas that the 20D/30D had, even though it’s considered part of their consumer lineup. Some of the nicest changes in my mind for the XTi are:

The ability to view the ISO in the viewfinder. On the 20D, you have to hunt for it
Larger LCD screen over the 20D
Canon sensor cleaning system


I consider the last one very important. I’m very careful when I change ...

To be honest, I’ve been asked before by other people, mostly over a few drinks, and up until now I’ve basically always politely declined, mainly because I didn’t think I could pull it off properly and do it justice.
So, after spending a few hours mulling it over tonight, I finally realized that I’m probably ready. Not only that, but ...

When it gets really bad, I usually take a melatonin, but those are pretty hit or miss with me. When they hit, they usually hit pretty hard, and I find myself pretty groggy in the morning.

Whenever it would happen, I would just stop using contractions in my head and write stuff out, but not only does that a) sound really dumb, but b) it also is really hard in some situations to remove the contractions completely without it ...

                    It’s crazy windy outside, and it’s been cloudy and yucky for most of the afternoon. I’ve been listening to the wind howl from my couch.
I took a quick break to snap some shots off my patio of the storm. One of them was used in this news story online. Here’s another shot I took as the clouds were breaking.

On another note, I figured out how to play In Repair by John Mayer on the guitar tonight.. My fingers are pretty small for it on the acoustic, but I can manage on my electric. Which makes me realize how badly I want a new guitar now. ...

                    Wow, big weekend for photography. I decided that this is “night shot” month, so most of my shots will be low light ones for a while.

And a HDR of Yaletown tonight, right before I went to bed.

                    I went out tonight and shot a few photos around town. I wanted to try my hand at making a HDR image. Here’s one of the better ones off the Burrard Street Bridge.

Here’s one more in roughly the same location.

                    I went out today and picked up a little Christmas present for myself – the Canon 430EX Speedlight. I’ve never really had a chance to get into flash photography, so I’m looking forward to messing around with it. The nice thing is that the internal flash on my 20D really sucks. For some reason they never included a focus assist lamp for low light conditions. Canon’s way around this was the fire the internal flash several times in a row to try and do a focus in low light. However, this usually scares whoever you’re trying to take a photo of, and causes all the epileptics in the room to ...

                    I just got back from quickly picking up my fixed Canon SD630 camera. Apparently the warp-core phase-inverter was out of alignment, so I had to get that readjusted to the tune of $160. Seriously, those guys can turn any small problem into a huge one that can cost lots of money. I was originally told the shutter door was broken, which seemed somewhat reasonable (I pictured a really small, weak hinge breaking). However, now it’s more along the lines of the “shutter solenoid ring was hosed.” How does a shutter solenoid ring break? Better question, what the hell is a shutter solenoid ring anyways? ...
