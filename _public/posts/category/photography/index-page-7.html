                    Last night, I decided I was way too lazy to drag my butt from the couch into my bedroom, so I just grabbed a blanket and slept there. And let me tell you — what a refreshing sleep. I sometimes forget just how comfy my couch really is. I woke up at like noon, with the sounds of birds chirping and the fresh air blowing through my apartment (ok, maybe no birds were chirping, but you get the idea). I decided that it was a really good day to go for a walk, and what better destination than to head to Kits to see Dustin and Dori.
I grabbed my iPod and my camera and walked down to the little ferry to ...

                    So there’s this buzz amongst photographers about this new technique called HDR (high dynamic range). The basic idea is that a camera isn’t capable of capturing nearly as much dynamic range as what our eyes can capture.? With HDR, you take multiple shots of the same scene using a digital camera on a tripod, and create a new photograph using the information from all the shots. That new image contains a much larger dynamic range than would be possible using any one shot.
Here are some cool examples from flickr.




I bought a new tripod and a remote shutter release for my 20D this weekend, so ...

                    First off — I hate my tripod.. I’m going to get a new one, just because it’s nearly impossible to figure out if mine is level. Anyways, I’m one of those somewhat stubborn people in life. I can be reasoned with, but if I’m in the wrong mood, it’s hard to change my mind about some things.. I’d rather do some weird acrobatic maneuver with a pool cue than admit defeat and use the granny. So when it comes to photography, I can probably count the number of times I’ve used a tripod in my life on one hand. That being said, I read once that the difference between a good photo and a great ...

                    First off, I met with my supervisor tonight to finalize my thesis.. Although I don’t have an official answer yet, it’s very likely I’ll be giving my defense next Thursday.. That’s really soon, and I have a lot of work to do before then, but the good news is then I’m completely done before I go on vacation, which would be pretty awesome.. There will definitely be booze ‘a flowin ‘a plenty Thursday night if I pull it off. On Friday I’m going to Cirque de Soleil, so I hope that my defense is Thursday so I can go out and get sloshed.
On another note, I found the best way ever to make ...

                    I was just reading that Sony has finally come out with a digital SLR of their own. At first I kind of scoffed at it, thinking that nobody really uses Sony these days (seems like everywhere I go someone has a Canon or Nikon SLR). However, reading the specs, it seems pretty impressive. I like the idea of putting the image stabilization in the camera body instead of on the lens. Canon charges quite a bit for the IS versions of several of its lenses, so it’s nice to know that Sony is a little smarter in this area. I’m not sure what the price point is for this new SLR, but it might be fun to check ...

                    I’m now the proud owner of my first L-series lens: the Canon EF 17-40mm f/4.0L. I’m just charging my 20D now, and then I’m heading out for a couple hours of shooting to see what this puppy can do (or can’t do maybe).
Look for a few pictures later tonight or tomorrow.
Update — I’m back, and I took some photos.. I found out that flickr doesn’t support the Adobe colour profile, which is why alot of my photos end up looking washed out on there.. I’m going to have to start shooting in sRGB again I think.

                    About 18 months ago, I picked up the Canon EOS 20D to replace my dying Canon Powershot camera. Stepping up from a point and shoot to a digital SLR was a pretty big step for me at the time, since I had never even really used an SLR camera before. I made a rookie mistake when I got it, and instead of buying a nice lens to go onto it, I picked up a cheap Sigma zoom lens. I spent the first few weeks completely disappointed with my camera, thinking that my point and shoot pictures were nearly as good as the ones coming off my SLR. After reading the newsgroups, I basically figured out that I needed ...
