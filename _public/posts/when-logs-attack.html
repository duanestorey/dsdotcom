                <p>The first news of the day is that yesterday after work I picked up a new set of glasses. I still haven’t finalized all the insurance papers that will let me get a refund on the first pair, but at least I’m no longer without a pair of glasses. The ladies at the eyeglass center were nice enough to remind me to remove them whenever I decided to step out, have a few drinks and then fall down.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the process of falling the first time, I seemed to have gotten the world’s largest splinter. To make it worse, it entered at the tip of my finger, and proceeded to go down the length of the finger itself, leaving hardly any entry point.</p>
<p>At first, I wasn’t even really sure it was a splinter, just that my finger hurt like hell. I thought perhaps it was broken, but after being in a lot of pain for a few days, I decided to do some exploration with some tweezers. I found a small chunk of a splinter, which I promptly removed, but the pain just got worse then next day. Out of desperation, I decided to press hard on my finger and see if I could figure out where the pain was coming from. You can imagine my surprise when about 1.5 cm of soggy wood came sliding out the tip of my finger.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t think that’s the end of the spliter, and it really feels like there is a good 5-10mm worth of wood stuck directly in the middle of the first segment of my finger. And no matter what I do, it doesn’t seem to want to come out. I can’t for the life of me think of any way to remove it other than to ask a doctor to go in and surgically remove it, but that seems like a pile of effort and scarring. Maybe over time it will slowly dissolve or something? I really have no idea. But I know it’s difficult to play guitar with my finger all sore, and I’m not particularly fond of a chunk of wood residing in the middle of my finger.</p>
