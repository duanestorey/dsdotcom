                <p>Tonight I had the stupid idea that I would come home from work and make a huge batch of perogies. Normally, I don’t attempt anything that dumb — at least not while sober — but with a big potlock coming up this weekend, I really need something to bring. Since I know my friends all like my grandma’s perogies, I decided to attempt that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/320272189/"><img loading="lazy" srcset="/assets/posts/2006/the-great-perogy-battle-1-320w.jpg 320w,/assets/posts/2006/the-great-perogy-battle-1-480w.jpg 480w" src="/assets/posts/2006/the-great-perogy-battle-1.jpg" alt="Little Bundles of Love"></a><br />
<strong>Perogies</strong><br />
So, I realize I’m not my grandma, and there’s no possible way I could put as much love and ukranian charm into my perogies as she does hers, but I thought I would take a stab at it. I’ve done this a few times, but at most I make perogies once a year, and everytime I forget just how much friggin work it is. First thing I had to do was call baba (my grandma) last night and get her to fill in the gaps in my memory. I knew the basics, but I forgot the little bits and pieces.</p>
<p>First problem with making perogies is that I really don’t have much food at home. To be honest, I hate grocery shopping. Like really hate it. If I had to choose between not eating for a day or going down to the grocery store, picking out food, standing in long lines, and then making three trips up from my parkade to the 15th floor, I think I’d rather starve. So, on my way home, I stopped at the IGA, hoping to only get a few things. Before I knew it, I had three heavy bags of stuff for the perogy battle, in addition to my laptop bag and my umbrella. I walked another 15 minutes, doing some weird funky shuffle down Howe street, trying to keep everything in balance. When I got to my place, my hands were killing me. This is the part of living downtown I hate.</p>
<p>I’ll skip all the stuff I had to do to make these things, but let me sum it up like this — <strong>I spent nearly four hours slaving over the frickin stove, cutting potatoes, rolling dough, pinching perogies — and that only amounted to 49 perogies</strong>. So, if you do the math, that’s about 4.8 minutes per perogy.</p>
<p>4.8 minutes. Per perogy.</p>

My god, are these things a lot of work. I really don’t know how baba does it.</p>
<p>The sad part is 49 perogies isn’t really alot, not for a group of people. Heck, I bet I could kill off 25 perogies myself if I was hungry enough, and my friend Brennen could probably do the whole lot himself. I think there are at least 12 people going to be at this dinner. It’s a potlock, so I really don’t have to bring a ton of perogies, but I definitely need to make at least one more batch. So, I can definitely look forward to giving up yet another night of my life this week making more of these frickin things.</p>
<p>Next time I’m bringing desert.</p>
<p>Update – I checked out Red Square based on one of the comments. Here’s a description of their perogies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vareniki come frozen in a 1 lb plastic bag. To serve, simply empty the package into a pot of rapidly boiling water and boil for up to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until they float to the top; strain and serve with sour cream and fried onions. Vareniki are very low in fat, are cholesterol-free, and provide a delicious and highly nutritious meal. Note that the Vareniki dough is made with no fats or eggs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They actually sound not bad. The only difference is that baba’s dough is made from vegetable fat <strong>and</strong> eggs, which is why it probably taste so damn good.</p>
