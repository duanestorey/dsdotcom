                <p>One of the things I’ve noticed lately is that I’m spending way more time on Twitter than I’d like. Truthfully, it’s fairly addictive, and I really don’t know why. This afternoon I noticed I noticed myself sitting on the updates page, refreshing occasionally, waiting for a few replies to some messages I had sent out. While doing that, I had the sudden idea that Twitter (at least for me) would be a bit more useful if it were a push system instead of a polling system. That way at least, I wouldn’t have to sit at the site and continue to poll it — I could simply be notified when a new @ message was ready for me.</p>
<p>Granted, there are numerous applications that can be used, but all of them (that I’ve used at least) are limited in that they primarily only handle one account at a time. So I decided to try hacking out a quick little PHP script that would simply IM me whenever I had a new message waiting.</p>
<p>It actually only took me about 20 minutes to finish, partially because I leveraged <a href="http://code.google.com/p/xmpphp/">the XMPP PHP</a> library, and partially because I’m familiar with the Twitter API (thanks to my work on WordTwit). I wrote it such that it would do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check Twitter updates from multiple accounts</li>
<li>Keep track of the last received IM message such that it only asks Twitter for new messages</li>
<li>Send out IMs periodically of new messages</li>
</ul>
<p>I set it up on a five minute CRON job on my server (which is also whitelisted for the Twitter API). The end result is visible here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/3747825984/"><img loading="lazy" srcset="/assets/posts/2009/twitter-over-im-1-320w.jpg 320w,/assets/posts/2009/twitter-over-im-1-480w.jpg 480w" src="/assets/posts/2009/twitter-over-im-1.jpg" alt="Twitter over IM"></a></p>
<p>As you can see, I get updates periodically with information, along with a prefix letting me know which account it came from. So far, it’s been working out well, but I’m having a bit of a hard time retraining myself not to check Twitter’s web interface from time to time. I’ve been told Adium has some Twitter features in a beta version, so I might check that out as well.</p>
<p>I’ve disabled growl notifications in Adium for new updates on this account (mainly because I don’t want to be distracted), but it’s nice to simply look down at the Dock from time to time to see how many replies I have waiting for me. So at least for now, this is a nice change, and hopefully will increase my productivity a bit.</p>
