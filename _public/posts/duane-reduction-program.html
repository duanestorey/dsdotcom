                <p>A few blog posts ago, I mentioned that I was going to do my best to return back to my pre-last-relationship weight. To that end, I have spent the last week hitting the gym from time to time and attempting to watch what I eat. The first week has been a bit rocky, and I hit a few tasty speed bumps at Rebecca’s Cinqo de Mayo party, but for the most part I’ve been on track. Since my life is a bit crazy thesedays, it’s challenging for me to always have access to “healthy” food, but I’ve been doing the best I can.</p>
<p>So without further ado, the progress after week #1 is (RSS drum roll please):</p>
<p>5.5 lbs  </p>
<p>Now, I know as well as everyone else that it’s basically impossible to lose more than about two pounds a week of real fat. So, undoubtedly a huge chunk of that weight is water (since the body drops water as it burns through the liver’s glycogen reserves). However, I am still down that weight, and it’s a pretty good motivator to see that fall off the scale right away. The week of my surgery should be a pretty good one, since it’s likely that I won’t eat for about 36 – 48 hours with the surgery prerequisites and the token nausea thanks to the general anesthetic. Plus, I’ll spend the week after surgery working from home, which thankfully means I can cook all my meals and eat without any peer pressure.</p>
<p>I’m probably going to switch my weekly check-ins to Fridays, since something always seems to happen on the weekend to sort of wreck the Monday check-in. But once I resync I’ll try to keep everything regular.</p>
<p>The next milestones (with names that probably only make sense to me right now), in descending order are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lost In Translation</li>
<li>The Great Barrier</li>
<li>Fight Club</li>
<li>50 First Dates</li>
</ol>
<p>You guys can guess what they mean (it’s actually more fun that way), but I’ll explain each one as I blast past it over the next month or two.</p>
