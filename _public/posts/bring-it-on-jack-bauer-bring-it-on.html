                <p>Yes people, today is a great day in TV land. Jack Bauer, aka Kiefer Sutherland, was released from jail after serving 48 days for drunken driving.</p>
<p>Now I gotta say — getting in a car while loaded is a dumb thing to do. I can openly admit I did it as a young adult once and a while, something as a grown adult I now look back on and realize how dumb it was. The trick is of course to plan ahead, otherwise you’ll find yourself stuck in the boonies with no way home. Now, I just refuse to get into situations like that, or at least have the means to pay for a long cab ride if I have to. I do understand sometimes as a kid you really feel like you have no other option, which is why it’s important to think about your way home before you even set out on your drinking adventure.</p>
<p>So while drinking and driving is dumb, I admire Kiefer for at least how he handled it. He said he was sorry, and he said he was willing to do whatever it took to move on. No drawn out legal battles trying to get around the issue. He just asked the court to take into considering the people on the set of 24 that would be out of jobs should the show be canceled, and asked to serve his time with that in mind, which the judge seemed to do without problem.</p>
<p>Today, Kiefer is free. Unfortunately the writer’s strike probably means we won’t see any episodes of 24 for a while, but at least there’s potential again.</p>
