                <p>I left Koh Samui in the afternoon on Friday and made my way down to the Maenom ferry dock. I booked a high speed catamaran with <a href="http://www.lomprayah.com/">Lomprayah</a>. They actually had a deal going on where they would include a pick-up at your hotel, so that worked out great. They give you a 20 minute window where you need to wait in front of your hotel, and eventually a shuttlebus picks you up and takes you down to the ferry. We actually were there with plenty of time to spare, but I suspect that’s deliberate since they have their own restaurant and store there, and there’s not much else to do.</p>
<p>The ferry to Koh Tao took around two hours, with a brief stop over in Koh Phangan. I whipped out my laptop for most of the trip and did some work, but they actually had a small TV at the front showing some comedy show, so most people were just doing that.</p>
<p>I grabbed a quick bite to eat when I landed at Koh Tao, and decided to hike my way to my hotel. I was staying at a place called the Sairee Hut Resort, which was basically on the opposite end of the main beach. So it took me roughly 30 minutes to walk there along a small concrete road.</p>
<p>Most rooms in Thailand are pretty cheap. I don’t think I’ve paid more than $35 for a hotel room since being in Thailand, and at that price you usually get something pretty nice. I mostly use <a href="http://agoda.com">Agoda.com</a> out in Asia, since they seem to have the best coverage.</p>
<p>Along the road to my hotel I saw a big sign for a pub crawl that was going on that night, so I decided I would check that out. I went for a little dip in the pool and then had a few drinks by the pool. While I was eating the sun was setting next to the beach hut I was in, so I put my fork down and took a few shots.</p>

<p>But once that was done I decided to toss on a pair of jeans and head down to the pub.</p>
<p><a href="_images/my-visit-to-koh-tao-thailand-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" srcset="/assets/posts/2011/my-visit-to-koh-tao-thailand-2-320w.jpg 320w,/assets/posts/2011/my-visit-to-koh-tao-thailand-2-480w.jpg 480w,/assets/posts/2011/my-visit-to-koh-tao-thailand-2-640w.jpg 640w" src="/assets/posts/2011/my-visit-to-koh-tao-thailand-2.jpg" alt="" title="Pub Crawlers"></a>Pub Crawlers</p>
<p>The pub ended up being a really great time. There were two Australian guys who were playing live music, and they kept asking people to come join them. Since they had a tambourine on them, I decided to get on stage and help turn the awesome knob up a few notches. Prior to that I had been sitting at the bar by myself just enjoying the atmosphere, but some girl eventually invited me to join her and her friends, which was great.</p>
<p>We ended up at another cool pub down the road, and eventually shut it down. Unfortunately at that point I started to walk home and somehow ended up getting myself completely lost. Unlike North America, there aren’t a lot of street lights to help you once most establishments shut down. Not only that, a lot of stores close their windows after they shut down, so the buildings don’t look like you remember them when you pass by later.</p>
<p>I eventually had to pay someone to drive me close to my house, since I was tired and just wanted to go to sleep. I found some Thai grandma and she got her daughter to give the stupid Canadian a scooter ride back to my place for a few bucks.</p>
<p>There’s only really one main stretch in Koa Tao, so I spent most of the next day just wandering around and taking advantage of the pool.</p>
<p>Koh Tao is mostly known for its diving, but I didn’t have enough time to get any dives in. One day perhaps I’ll try and get my diving certification, but that’s probably a ways off.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Koh Tao is a beautiful island, and it was great to just chill out and enjoy some of the scenery.</p>

<p>I had to get up early this morning to make my way to Koh Phi Phi. It was a pretty long trip, and I nearly missed my flight, but I made it. More on that in my next entry.</p>
