<p>Today I got an email from an old friend I hadn’t heard from in a while. <a href="http://ajillstory.com">Jill</a> wrote me an email and let me know than her boyfriend thought he would be the poster boy for immaturity and break up with her via email. Obviously, I don’t think that’s very cool. You would think if you care about someone you would at least have the decency to do it in person.</p>
<p>That period of time after I got tossed through that window was obviously pretty hard on me. I went through two surgeries, months of recovery time (during which the left side of my face was completely numb — it’s actually still pretty numb, but you get used to it), and to be honest, was pretty much a sorry shell of the person I’d like to think of myself as. Strangely enough, a lot of what kept me going each day were the comments I would receive on my blog, and the odd email I’d receive from strangers. One lady in New York, someone I had never met, sent me $20 US along with a really nice card and instructions to go buy myself some nachos. Truthfully, that act, in the state I had been in, nearly brought me to tears. That’s how I met Jill actually — she emailed me out of the blue one time when I was sad and offered me a bit of happiness to help cheer me up.</p>
<p>It’s easy to forget the reasons why we blog. Sometimes waking up each day and filtering through the mass of content is overbearing. Sometimes you get a pile of nasty comments and associated emails. Sometimes you write a thoughtful piece, only to be criticized and told you’re stupid. Sometimes you get called out on the Internet and have to spend considering time and effort defending yourself.</p>
<p>And then sometimes you meet people like Jill – people who reach out to strangers and lend some of their sunshine to brighten your day. And while I’ve never met Jill in real life, it’s clear she has a really big heart (and also a big Truck I think). So today it’s my turn to return some of that sunshine I’ve been given in the past. Jill, I hope your heart doesn’t stay broken for long and that you find someone worthy of your affection. Your BC friends are here for you whenever you need us.</p>
<p><strong>Sorry for everyone who commented on this — I accidentally deleted it while playing with my blog and had to restore it from my RSS feed</strong></p>
