                    I’ve been busy making plans for April. I haven’t pulled the trigger yet on most of it, but I’ve done a preliminary timetable and the budget works. So this is what it’s looking like.
March 31 – April 5 – New York City, USA
April 6 – April 10 – Shannon &amp; Limerick, Ireland
April 11 – April 15 – Edinburgh, Scotland
April 15 – April 17 – Dublin, Ireland
April 17 – April 21 – London outskirts, England
April 21 – April 26 – Paris, France

There’s a bit of bouncing around there, but I’m coordinating meeting up with a few other people, and that’s how it has to ...

                    Yes, they are here — my Moo cards finally arrived in the mail today. I officially ordered them exactly one month ago, so it took a full four weeks to get here. Looking at the packaging, it looks like they went from London, UK to Germany, and then finally over here to Canada.
Considering that they state they all shipping is done with First Class airmail, I’m pretty surprised that it not only takes this long to get here, but also that there isn’t some sort of tracking number. In fact, there are no markings on the packaging at all to indicate when it finally did ship from London, which seems ...

                    I’m pretty bagged, so this will be short. The flight leaving Heathrow was pretty much a complete clusterfuck. Apparently they were out of gates, so they just parked the 747 on the concrete a mile away and had to shuttle us all there in small groups.. We took off around an hour late.. About an hour into it, we had some pretty wicked turbulence, which for someone who hates flying basically unnerved me.
I popped a few sleeping pills when we hit altitude and managed to sleep for most of the flight home (surprisingly, because I had an aisle seat, and nobody asked me to get up so they could go to ...

                    I approximately 24 hours, I’ll be stepping off a plane at Heathrow and rushing madly to see some of London before my connecting flight to Vancouver leaves in the early evening. I think I’ll probably only have about 3 and a half hours to see London, which I’m sure doesn’t give me much time to see very much. With the time constraints, it looks like I’m gonna shell out $100 for the express train that goes from the airport to Paddington Station near central London. From there, I’m really not sure what I’m going to do. It still seems like quite a haul to get to any of the attractions, ...

                    So I have a few minutes to kill here at Heathrow, so I thought I would write a quick blog entry. The flight from Vancouver to here was relatively uneventful. The guy next to me was sort of a prick, and unfortunately for me I don’t think he brushed his teeth yesterday, but I survived. I haven’t slept a wink, so I’m hoping I can sleep for an hour or two on the next flight to Helsinki. I think my next flight is delayed slightly, which means I probably won’t get into the hotel until around 10pm or so. One thing is for certain — I’m definitely going to be ready to have a nice long sleep ...
