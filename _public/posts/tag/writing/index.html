                    Turns out I havenâ€™t written anything in almost two weeks now. Truthfully, I almost completely forgot about my blog, partially a consequence of not having anything to write about, and partially due to all the things I have going on lately. Iâ€™ve actually quite enjoyed taking a break, and donâ€™t really think youâ€™ll see much in the way of content over the next few months, other than a post here and there when Iâ€™m bored or have something on my mind. If you want, follow my Twitter stream for some random amusement.
I spent the last weekend pretty close to home. My friend Jeff had a birthday ...

                    I havenâ€™t really had much to say on here in a while. Other than maybe a camping trip this weekend, and WordCamp San Francisco at the end of the month, the next six weeks or so are pretty booked up solid with some client projects. After that Iâ€™m going to take a bit of a break for the summer and do some camping or maybe even head over to Europe to visit some friends.
So on that note, Iâ€™m going to take a break from traditional blog posts and do a week or so worth of photo entries. Comment if you like, donâ€™t comment if you like ðŸ™‚ But enjoy!

                    I havenâ€™t written on here in a few days now. Thatâ€™s a long stretch for me. Truth is, Iâ€™m just kind of busy and a bit bagged. I havenâ€™t been sleeping all that well lately, and feel like Iâ€™m a walking zombie. I was feeling pretty nauseous all yesterday, and didnâ€™t really eat that much. I hardly slept at all last night and woke up feeling like I was going to throw-up, so I decided to work from home today and try to save whatâ€™s left of my body here.
I decided a few weeks ago that Iâ€™m taking this weekend off. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to end up doing, but Iâ€™m really hoping it ...
