I‚Äôm so far behind on everything, it‚Äôs not even funny. Being in the hospital set me back over a week, and my recent trip out east set me back even further. I‚Äôm going to try and use this weekend to catch up. Here‚Äôs what I need to do.

Tidy apartment and do laundry. I hate this part.
Unfuck photoshop some how
Mail photos to everyone
Backup computer and free some space
Install XP via boot camp so I can play games
Finish wedding photos for Mike and Kim (sorry guys)
Answer a bazillion emails that I haven‚Äôt yet. If I haven‚Äôt answered you, I‚Äôm sorry üôÅ If I have, feel lucky!

                    One of the pieces of technology I‚Äôve always thought was pretty cool was the new Lightscribe CD burners out there on the market. Prior to Lightscribe technology, the best a home user could really do was to be an ink-jet printer, print out a CD label, and then mess with putting it on in the right place. Some companies tried to make blank CDs with actual, printable surfaces, but those didn‚Äôt really work.
But somewhere, after a few beers, some genius came up with the great idea of simply etching the label on the CD using the laser built into the CD burner. And thus, Lightscribe was created.

                    As I mentioned in my last blog entry, the other day I had a chance to photography my first wedding. All in all, it was a pretty rewarding experience.
The day started at around 11am for me and Hesty. We suited up, did some last minute charging of equipment, and then got in touch with the groom. Normally the photographer heads over to the where the bride is getting ready for some photos, but Kim‚Äôs aunt wanted to do those ones, so I was relieved of that duty.
We met Mike and the groomsmen down at the Holiday Inn in Langley to get ready. In true Chilliwack style, Mike, instead of hopping in the ...

                    Last night I had the chance to photograph the wedding of two of my old friends. It was a great experience, and I‚Äôm fairly satisfied with how the photos turned out, considering how dark it was both outside and inside the reception area.

  
I‚Äôll do a full write-up on everything I learned about shooting a wedding, but right now I have a turkey to eat. I shot over 1000 shots at the wedding, and I‚Äôve slowly been sorting them. I put about 150 or so of them on Flickr if anyone is interested. There are still more I have to process and put together, but there‚Äôs enough that it‚Äôs fairly good representation ...

I‚Äôm really glad I got a chance to try out a bunch of photos in a real setting, because I made a few mistakes that I likely won‚Äôt make tomorrow. I‚Äôm gonna keep this short, because I still have lots to do. Next blog entry will probably be Sunday after everything is over. ...

So tomorrow, I‚Äôm going to head into work and see if I can pull off a full day. I tried to go to the clinic tonight for a check-up, but there was over a two hour wait, so I‚Äôm going to try again in the morning on my way to work.
Also, this weekend I‚Äôll be attending Mike and Kim‚Äôs wedding as the primary photographer, which is both exciting and a bit stressful. It‚Äôs not hard to grab a camera and take a bunch of photos, but it is hard to be prepared, both technically and mentally, ...
