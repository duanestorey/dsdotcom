                    I’m a big fan of naps. In the summer, I love nothing more than passing out on the couch with a book, and sleeping passively with the sound of a lawnmower churning off somewhere in the distance. In the winter, I sometimes turn the fireplace on in the early evening and close my eyes on the couch. I don’t sleep long usually. 30 minutes sometimes, maybe an hour. Usually just long enough for the world to slowly dissolve into a dream. And in that brief moment when I wake up, sometimes it briefly feels like I’m in another place, or another time in my life. I’m often reminded how the smell of ...

I just realized I don’t own any glasses, just mugs
My plants are all dead or dying
My christmas tree is still up
I don’t look at bills before I pay them, I typically just pay a random amount and hope it’s right
I’ve lived in my current apartment for two and a half years, and I still don’t have a bedroom suite or a dresser for my clothes
I have the boxes for my iMac and my Macbook pro still in the corner of my living room. They make me happy
I collect wine. But I don’t really drink it.
I get groceries once a month, and my fridge is about 50% beer
I have nine cores worth of computing ...

                    So, this is the first blog entry I’ve written in quite some time while disconnected from the internet. I’m about 30 minutes out of San Francisco, somewhere around 40,000 feet. I feel like complete shit, and I’m really glad I decided to head back today instead of risking being down south and getting even sicker. A few minutes ago I had my head in my lap in pretty much unbearable pain — turns out my right ear had some real problems adjusting to the change in pressure in the airplane, probably since I’m so congested right now. If I don’t see some major changes in how I feel by tomorrow, ...

I just looked at my computer clock and realized that today is Valentine’s day, and here I am, on my couch in the dark, alone. I talked with my ex-girlfriend briefly on the phone tonight, asked how she was doing, what she was up to, the same old same old. We were trying to figure out a time to get together for dinner, and she said that Wednesday night was obviously out. And even though I wanted to ask, I didn’t. Because really, who wants to know what their ex is doing for Valentine’s day?
So, what do I plan to do? I’m not really sure, but I imagine it’s going to involve some liquor down ...
