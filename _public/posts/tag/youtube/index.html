                    I thought I’d mix it up a bit and post something a little different. This is a cute little video that was shot at the Vancouver Aquarium a few years ago. Consequently, it has become one of the most watched videos on YouTube of all time. This one version has been viewed over ten million times.

                    So here’s some food for thought for the blogosphere. Lately I’ve been pondering a few of the legal aspects of the Internet, namely what it is we are all allowed to do, and what it is some companies think we shouldn’t be allowed to. Let me give you a use-case to demonstrate what I’m talking about.

Photo by Ben Sheldon on Flickr
Let’s say I set up a blog, and I’m checking out Flickr and I see a photo I like. Let’s say for a second that the CC license is set in such a way that I can use the photo on my blog. So, I right click on the image, say “copy image address”, and slap it ...

                    Ok, seriously. The things I would do if I had a few million bucks. I’m amazed to no end how many things about the internet kind of suck. Things that you’d think would be easy to fix, but for whatever reason nobody gets around to fixing them.
First company that I need to bash is YouTube. Seriously, Google buys you for 1.6 BILLION dollars and what’s the first thing you do? Stick your head in the sand. How come there aren’t any cool features, or you know, like standard features coming your way. Why do you always screw up the audio/video sync on EVERY video I upload?
Another prime example ...

                    I accidentally ran into this song the other day on my iPod (yes, I have lots of music I haven’t heard before on my iPod), and there’s something about it I really liked. I’ve been working on playing it myself, and I’m pretty close. It’s rather hard (for me) to pick this song and try singing at the same time, but I’m getting better. In the video the other guy is doing most of the guitar work.
Check it out. It’s an acoustic version they recorded at MTV. ...

                    I’ve sort of gotten tired of dragging my big digital SLR with me everywhere, so lately I’ve been taking along my little Canon point and shoot, which by comparison takes garbage photos, but the size and weight of it is attractive. I’ve been thinking I might start taking a pile more videos just for the hell of it.
While this video is completely boring, I just decided to give a quick virtual tour of my apartment, with a quick video of how nice a day it is in Vancouver.
Don’t worry, they’ll get better. ...

                    A few months ago, I wrote a flickr plugin for wordpress that integrated with a few different image galleries including Lightbox and Greybox. As last count, 126 different blogs were using the crossroads plugin to show their flickr images in their posts.
While updating my blog theme last night, I realized one of the current problems I have with most of the themes I downloaded. Typically, a theme will present the full content of a few blog entries on the main page. A few of the “cooler” themes I’ve seen only show one post on the main page, which is sort of a neat idea if you don’t write very ...
