                    I can’t really say that I’ve seen much of Victoria since being here, since I haven’t really been out that much. That said, it’s been really great just hanging out with some old friends and taking it easy.
My friend Jeff (who has been a friend of mine since high school) picked me up at the Helicopter pad in Victoria on Friday night, and we spent most of the night just chilling at his place watching movies. Today Jeff, Michele and I took Maya (their 2.5 yr old daughter) down to her gymnastics class and watched that for an hour or so. Then we came back to Jeff’s house and made a pretty ...

                    This upcoming weekend I’m shutting the computers down and heading over to Vancouver Island. One of my best friends from high school (and also university) lives over in Oak Bay in Victoria now — strangely enough I haven’t really seen him in about a year, mainly because we’ve both been busy.
I’m sort of known amongst my friends as the guy who is always busy. I don’t try to be, it just always seems like there’s some event or something I’ve committed to that I have to go to. That’s why a few months ago I said I was taking a break from all the Vancouver events — it’s not that ...

                    I got home from Canada Day tonight and spent a bit of time on IM chatting to people. My friend Jeff, who is one of my best friends from high school, was online so we ended up chatting for a bit. Despite living only a few blocks apart, the sad thing is Jeff and I rarely get to see each other due to both our crazy schedules.

I found out tonight that Jeff is moving to Victoria with his wife Michele and his daughter Maya. To be honest, while I want the best for them, it made me feel bad that I’ve been out of the loop so long with them that I had no idea they were moving away in a few weeks. I’m ...

                    Yes, today I briefly debated getting out of my bed at around nine, but decided sleeping in until noon was a better idea. I’ve had this recurring dream for the last few years that always feels so real. In it, someone (usually my friend Jeff) tells me about some university exam that I’m late for. Of course, everyone is completely prepared for the exam except for me. So I get to the exam and struggle for a good portion of my dream trying to come up with answers I don’t have.
For whatever reason, that one always seems real to me. When I wake up, I sometimes almost want to make a call to the ...

                    Believe it or not, not one but two of my friends are celebrating birthdays today. First, is my good friend Jeff from Chilliwack. We’ve been friends for a long, long time now.

Jeff In Costa Rica
I actually sort of met Jeff in grade nine math class, when him and I would team up and blow spitballs into Margo’s hair instead of doing derivatives. Good times indeed.
And of course, today is also Keira’s birthday. I haven’t known Keira as long as Jeff, but in the time I’ve known her she’s been a good friend, and she’s obviously a great gal — I wish her the all best for her 27th birthday.

                    So yesterday, I met up with Jessica, Brennen, Kaedy, Michele, Jeff, Maya, Margo and Robbie, and the troop of dogs down in Steveston. In the old days, we started this day called “Friends Day”, where we would schedule in a day to hang out with our old high school friends. It sounds a bit lame, but with everyone’s time constraints, we found if we didn’t set aside time to hang out, it never happened.
So, even though yesterday wasn’t actually a friend’s day, we still managed to all meet out in Steveston for a few hours of hanging out. Brennen and Jessica recently had baby Kaedy, and Jeff ...
