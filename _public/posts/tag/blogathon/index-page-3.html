                    We just had a pile of Dairy Queen here, which was awesome and much appreciated. So thanks Dairy Queen, for the food, and thanks Rebecca, for organizing it’s delivery.
Things definitely seem a bit less active around here right now, probably because everyone’s stomachs are all full of food now. I wouldn’t be surprised though if people are losing a bit of stream — we’ve all been at this nearly 8 hours already, and still have 16 hours to go. If my brain were a car engine right now, it would probably be firing on only one cylinder. I’ve been having a hard time constructing complete sentences ...

                    I posted a photo of a cruise ship this morning surrounded by the mountains:

I was just reading the news though, and apparently that very same ship ended up killing a baby whale:

What appears to be a baby minke or fin whale has been impaled and killed on a cruise ship that docked in Vancouver Saturday morning.
The whale, about 20 metres long, was wrapped around the bow of the ship in full view of tourists at Canada Place.
A worker from the cruise ship, who didn’t want to be named, said he was not sure when the whale had been hit. The boat — the Sapphire Princess — had come in from Alaska ...

                    Vancouver is without a doubt one of the prettiest cities in the world, something that I appreciate more and more every time I go on a trip. In fact, I was just mentioning to a friend yesterday just how clean and inviting Vancouver is compared to most cities, specifically San Francisco and Los Angeles (both of which seem grubby and dirty by comparison, even though I happen to like aspects of both).

And while Vancouver is a pretty city, it is not without its problems. In fact, Vancouver’s lower-east side is one of the poorest neighbourhoods in all of Canada, which is ironic given that it’s ...

                    Since I wrote in detail about Vancouver in my last post, it’s only fitting that I talk a little bit about my current place of residence, Chilliwack. Chilliwack is a little farming community nestled between a mountain range, approximately 100 kms east of Vancouver. My apartment is probably only about 5 minutes from one of the nicest provincial parks in the province, complete with it’s own picturesque lake:

I currently rent a 1200 square foot apartment for about $100 less a month than I was paying in Vancouver for my 700 square foot apartment. A new grocery store opened about two blocks away ...

                    One of the hobbies I have that brings me a lot of enjoyment is photography. It’s something I’ve slowly honed and improved over the years to the point where I’m fairly comfortable with my camera, and with taking photos in most situations. Given how much enjoyment it’s been to me, I thought I would periodically do the odd photo-entry for blogathon and talk a bit about the photos I share.

This shot of Kitsilano beach is one of the shots I’m most known for. It’s currently used on the Kitsilano.ca website, and also in a few brochures. I was actually just randomly driving back from UBC ...

Despite not really spending much time with them over the last ten years (mostly because I lived in a different city), I’m actually fairly close to both of them, and have really been enjoying my time with them since moving back to Chilliwack. Last night my niece gave me a phone call and told me about all of the boy crushes she had while at summer camp (count ’em people, 11 boy crushes).
So this post is dedicated to all the kids in everyone’s lives, and how special they all are. ...

I’m currently on my third coffee. I woke up and had a 7-11 coffee (because that’s all I could find at 5:30am), then pounded back some coffee here at Workspace, and just picked up a new coffee from a little Gastown coffee shop called Lunas. I imagine I’ll probably average a coffee every two hours or so, which would put me somewhere in the neighborhood of about 600 – ...

One of my favorite photos is this next one from Gastown I took last year from the lookout at Harbour Center:

I actually shot the photograph through a window, so it’s surprising that you can’t see any glass. But I’ve always liked all the angled lines in the photo, and of course the film-noir type lighting. If you’re ever in Vancouver, make sure you head ...

The Chip’s Not Dead Yet Memorial Mile supports BC Children’s Hospital and the uphill battles faced by children who are trying to get well, and the medical staff who are trying to make miracles happen.

I tried to get up at around 7am, but my body wasn’t too happy about it, so instead I slept in until around 8:30am, and now I feel pretty decent.
In theory I should go easy on coffee today such that tonight I can have yet another decent sleep, so that’s probably what I’ll do. Tomorrow however I’ll be pushing my little donkey cart down caffeine mountain there and riding it all the way to the bottom. I’m hoping there’s some easy to ...

In less than 48 hours Blogathon 2009 will officially kick off. Some people will be down at WorkSpace in Vancouver hanging out, and others will be congregating in the Valley somewhere. I still haven’t decided where I’ll end up, although I’m leaning towards the WorkSpace route, as it would be nice to hang out with some friends for the day, and cross the finish line as a group. Free Ice Cream is pretty rad too, so.

                    I just got off the air with The Hawk, Chilliwack’s Rock station, located at 98.5 on your Chilliwack/Abbotsford dials. Rebecca Bollwitt is currently putting a recording of the broadcast on her Viddler account, at which point I’ll put it up here for everyone to listen to recorded the interview, and has provided it for everyone’s listening pleasure — thanks Rebecca!
I hadn’t really thought about a goal for fundraising, so I said I was going to attempt to raise $2,000. The good news is that I think that’s a realistic goal, but I’ll need everyone’s help. So if you can help at all by ...

                    Last week I had the chance to talk to Paul Henderson of the Chilliwack Times regarding Blogathon. We ended up talking about various other items, including Facebook and Twitter, and some of my thoughts about the stuff I was doing over at InTheWack.com (which I need to update a bit more frequently).
Today the Chilliwack Times ran a story in the local paper, and it appears the online version is available here.
Just a couple of clarification points:

Last year Rebecca and I supported the Union Gospel Mission. This year she is supporting it (as well as others I’m sure). The caption in the photo seems ...

                    I’ve been approved on the official Blogathon website, which means people can actually start pledging for me now. Strangely enough, I’ve already received about $80 in pledges, several of which came in before I was approved on the website. They appear to be legit, but I can’t for the life of me figure out where they came from.
But anyways, as I’ve pointed out in previous postings, I’ll be supporting the BC Children’s Hospital on July 25th. So if you’d like to support my efforts and the children at BC Children’s Hospital, then please consider pledging. Thanks for the support! ...

                    This year’s Blogathon takes place on July 25th, starting at 6am PDT. As most people know, last year I teamed up with Rebecca Bollwitt to help support the Union Gospel Mission in Vancouver. With some help from Matthew Good, the three of us raised around $8,000 I believe for Vancouver’s homeless.
Without a doubt, Blogathon is an event that I wanted to be a part of this year. I briefly debated supporting a local Chilliwack charity, but given that I really don’t know of many here, I decided not to go that route.
Lately I’ve found myself spending quite a bit of time with my niece and nephew. ...

                    I’ve been lying in bed for about 20 minutes now, trying to slow my brain down enough so that I can finally catch up on sleep. Unfortunately, my mind has been racing ever since blogathon, and it’s been rather difficult to shut it off.
While in bed tonight, I started thinking about the day I had today, the people I spent it with, and the events of this past weekend. Like a hiker nearing the end of a long trek, I forced myself to stop and survey the trail from which I’ve come; the moments of exhaustion, the long rainy nights, the hills and the valleys, and the painful blisters that may never ...

                    Well, there’s only five hours left in my first blogathon. It’s actually been a pile of fun, even though I’m fairly exhausted. I want to give a big round of applause to everyone that’s been a part of this event, especially those that are also nearing the end (and thankfully, get to go to bed soon). There’s a third shift starting tonight at 10pm, so there will be plenty to read tonight.
And while the blog entries and those who pen them are obviously to be commended, I think we need to all remember our respective charities, and remember the causes we are all fighting for. While I spent ...

                    Trans fat is the dietary equivalent of the devil. It provides no nutritional value, and reeks havoc on the body’s ability to transport fats through the blood. In terms of the different types of fat that people obtain through their diet, the following effects take place:

Saturated fat raises LDL (the bad cholesterol), but basically leaves HDL (the good stuff) in tack
Polyunsaturated fat raises HDL (the good stuff), so it helps you
Monounsaturated fat typically raises HDL, but sometimes raises LDL, so while it usually is good for you, in excess it can sometimes be bad for you
Trans fat raises ...
