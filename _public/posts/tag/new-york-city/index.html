                    Well, it’s officially midnight in Buenos Aires, which means I can start wishing happy birthdays. Today of course is Dale’s 31st birthday. Dale is not only a trusted friend, but the second (and arguably less good-looking) half of BraveNewCode, the company that Dale and I both own.

The last few years have had ups and downs, seeing me move from Vancouver, to Chilliwack, and now to Argentina. Amongst all the turmoil, there have been only a few constants, and Dale has been one of them. For the most part, I have talked to Dale nearly every day for the last few years, sometimes about politics, about ...

                    This is pretty stupid. The US government sanctioned the flight of a low-flying 747 over New York city the other day. Obviously seeing a large commercial airliner flying low over New York City set a lot of people into a panic. For whatever reason, that flight was deemed somewhat classified so nobody could tell the people living in New York City about it.

                    By now I’m sure you’ve heard that Heath Ledger, one of the stars of the movie Brokeback Mountain, was found dead in NYC. While nobody really knows for sure what happened, police have said he was on both antidepressants and ambien, which is a relatively new form of sleeping pill that a few of my friends have taken from time to time for insomnia. Ambien by itself has a relatively good safety record, but when taken in combination with any other agent that has the ability to suppress the central nervous system, it has been fatal before.
Why I’m writing this entry is because the last few entries ...

                    I apologize for being a day late on this, but I’ve been a bit busy with a few things. Yesterday, as most people know, was the sixth anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Last year on that day, I was flying into Logan airport in Boston, which was a bit strange considering some of the highjackers left Logan that morning six years ago and put a plane into the World Trade Center.

Last summer, I decided I would go to New York City and pay my respects in person, so I got on a plane and spent four days out there. The shot above was taken as I passed by. It was ...

                    Unfortunately, the night before I left for New York City turned out to be a gong show. Mark, Donovan, Chris and myself went out to the bar for a few drinks, but we didn’t stop until around 2am. I figured, no problem right — I still have 4 hours to sleep and pack before leaving for the airport. Needless to say, Friday morning was really rough, and I was completely exhausted and hungover.
What made it worse is that our plane was broken. After 30 minutes of waiting past of scheduled boarding time, finally the Harmony Airlines representative comes out and says “due to a minor technical problem, ...

                    When the humidity finally woke me up in the hostel, it was around 11am (I had to ask scary hostel-buddy #1, since I didn’t have a watch anymore at this point). I felt a little hungover, but nothing compared to the morning before back in YVR. I thought about showering, but my I-need-to-get-the-hell-out-of-the-hostel-as-soon-as-possible thought process eventually won. I strolled down the street in New York City, smiling as I walked into Ray’s Pizza, knowing full well I was about to destroy his little toilet in the back-room with my post-hangover blues. I read through my Lonely Planet for a few ...
