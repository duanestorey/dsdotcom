                    As you can plainly see, I spent some time updating my blog theme the other day. One of the main problems whenever anyone does any web development is still unfortunately in the area of supporting multiple browsers. Usually a design that at first looks good in your development browser might look a bit weird in IE or another one.
It takes a lot of effort sometimes to make a site work in multiple browsers, something that should not be lost on those who visit sites frequently. For the most part, I‚Äôm lazy in this area. I generally target Sarfari and Firefox, and just sort of pray that it works in ...

                    For all of you people who upgraded to Leopard and are using GMail, you have have noticed a few weird things going on. For me, my contacts no longer auto complete properly, and periodically all the javascript in gmail stops working.
I‚Äôve checked a lot of newsgroups and many people are having the same problems. Apparently gmail has tried moving to a newer version that isn‚Äôt really compatible with Safari 3.0 yet. The solution is to just go up to the top right in gmail and click ‚Äúold version‚Äù, which will roll back your GMail version to one that does work with Safari.

                    So tonight I was trying to figure out just how in the world I was going to go about merging multiple RSS feeds together. The end result I was trying to achieve was so my RSS feed on this site would actually have my entries from duanestorey.com as well as those from matthewgood.org. I sort of assumed that feedburner would do that for me, but it turns out you can‚Äôt combine your own RSS feeds using it.
The solution? Yahoo Pipes. I had never heard of it, but after doing a quick search, I learned it‚Äôs the tool to use. And man oh man, is it cool.

                    Yesterday, partly by chance, and later by design, I found that I didn‚Äôt log into an IM client for nearly the entire day. No Jabber, no Yahoo, no Windows Live or whatever they are calling it now ‚Äî just me, alone with my machine.
And it was everything that I thought it would be.
Now let me just tell you what a typical day is like for me on IM. I have, quite easily, well over 100 people on my IM client. A small percentage of these are personal (friends and family), but without a doubt, the majority are business related. During a typical work day, I‚Äôd say 70 of them or so are online and working ...

                    If you accessed my website at all today, you would witnessed one of the slowest websites to ever grace the series of tubes that we call the internet. I spent about two hours on the phone today with web hosting company GoDaddy.com trying to convince them that it was their problem. Unfortunately, even after escalating it multiple times, they still told me it was my fault.
So about an hour ago I decided that I had had enough of GoDaddy. I cancelled my hosting, acquired new hosting via HostMonster, and managed to change my DNS and completely set up my blog from scratch in a little under an hour. Unfortunately ...
