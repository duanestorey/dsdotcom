                    I gotta say, this week has been fairly insane in terms of heat. Given that I live inland now, it’s been a few degrees warming than in Vancouver. The other day, while camping, the humidex hit 45C up at the lake, which is actually hotter than the hottest day I experienced back in Ottawa when I lived there (which was 43C). Let me tell you, it’s hot.
I just tossed some burgers on the BBQ here. I briefly debated just tossing them on the ground, as I’m pretty sure they would have cooked just as well down there. I just finished watering my tomato plants for the second time today, as they were starting ...

                    Heat is a totally awesome movie starring both Al Pacino and Robert Deniro. There are many classic scenes in it, but one that stands out is the coffee shop banter between Pacino and Deniro where we learn a pile about both characters. This type of scene has been used in countless movies since then, but they all basically pay homage to this part.
Why I think it’s so fascinating is that both characters open up to each other and somehow relate, even though they are basically enemies by trade. And let’s be honest, Deniro and Pacino both kick ass. ...

                    This is, unfortunately, my last full day at the resort. Tomorrow I get to wake up, pack my bags, and start the long journey back to Vancouver. While this place is really pretty amazing, I always get a bit excited whenever I get on a plane that’s heading for home.

  
I get into Montreal tomorrow evening, and will be staying overnight in a nice hotel near the airport. While the rooms here are fairly nice, the beds are unanimously hard and I haven’t had the best sleeps. Hopefully the bed in the Hilton is nice and soft so I can get a really great sleep tomorrow night.

                    To be honest, I’m not such a big fan of pre-arranged adventures at resorts. I’ve been on a few, and most of them are pretty basic and you kind of feel like it wasn’t money well spent. However, I heard a lot of good things about the safari adventure, so I decided to check it out for the low price of $60 USD.
We left the resort at 9am, and proceeded to head into the lush Dominican Countryside. It was absolutely gorgeous, full of rolling hills, lush green vegetation, and a ton of friendly Dominican people. The safari jeep was loaded to the brim of soft drinks and booze, and nobody had an empty ...
