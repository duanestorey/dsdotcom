                    Believe it or not, not one but two of my friends are celebrating birthdays today. First, is my good friend Jeff from Chilliwack. We’ve been friends for a long, long time now.

Jeff In Costa Rica
I actually sort of met Jeff in grade nine math class, when him and I would team up and blow spitballs into Margo’s hair instead of doing derivatives. Good times indeed.
And of course, today is also Keira’s birthday. I haven’t known Keira as long as Jeff, but in the time I’ve known her she’s been a good friend, and she’s obviously a great gal — I wish her the all best for her 27th birthday.

                    After work I swung by the Alibi room in Gastown to help celebrate Jeremy Crowle’s birthday. I was a bit tired from this whole week so didn’t end up staying out super late, but I managed to drink a few rum and diet cokes and buy Jer a beer.
There’s another party tonight that I was invited to, but I’m not sure if I’ll hit that. I think I really need a nice night inside with some movies. I have to hit the airport in a sec and drop my friend Hesty off for the start of his vacation. After that I’ll probably check out the Eastside Culture Crawl with some friends.
Also, Rebecca and John are ...

                    Last night I met up with Rebecca and John for some drinks at Fogg ‘N Sudds on Robson Street. It’s pretty much tradition with those two to watch any weekend hockey games down there, and whenever I can, I swing by to sample their fish bowl high ball drinks.
Afterwards, we all went over to Trevor’s house and sat around drinking wine. Trevor has a pretty cool penthouse apartment in the West End with a great view of Vancouver.

                    Well, it’s now official — not only am I officially 30, but I have also survived my 30th birthday party. Thanks to everyone who came out to enjoy a few beers. In my case, thanks to all the shots, I drank way more than I’m used to. While I had a great time, unfortunately I slipped down the stairs at Honey and lost my glasses long enough for a few people to step on them. So, apparently I’ll be visiting the eyeglass store this week to put in a new order.
Thanks everyone who popped by.

                    Well, in just a few hours, yours truly will be turning 30. I originally set out last night to write something memorable, and spent a few hours writing a blog entry that I hoped would detail the last ten years of my life. However, upon waking up this morning, I realized that it wasn’t really what I wanted to say, probably because I think it was heavily influenced by the events of the last six months.
The truth is, this has probably been the hardest year of my life. Between a big breakup, that assault in November, a surgery and some other personal things in my life, it was really quite a challenge ...

                    So last night I headed down to the Alibi room for Keri’s 29th birthday party. I got the official invite via a myspace bulletin a while ago, and slotted it into my calender. The piece I apparently forgot I guess was the “RSVP via Email” thing at the bottom. So tonight, I got all dolled up, and headed down there for 10pm. Only problem was nobody else was there.. So, I got myself a drink, and waited. After an hour I realized there were a few holes in my original plan.. Unfortunatley, my cell phone was recently fixed, and I don’t have many numbers in there yet, so I had no way to contact any ...
