                    I went out for a few beers tonight with Boris and Dave down in Yaletown, a pseudo celebration for Cinco De Mayo. One of the topics that came up casually over a few margaritas was the fast approaching onslaught of Vancouver technology events.

Kicking it off in approximately two weeks is the fourth iteration of Launch Party Vancouver down at the Republic on Granville street. It‚Äôs always a great event, and most of the local technology companies (and freelancers) are usually in attendance. I was sort of the unofficial photographer for Launch Party III, and will definitely bring my camera around ...

                    Today marked the launch of Strutta, a local company that has been working hard to create a unique gaming experience. I had the opportunity to check out their product about six weeks ago and play with an early alpha. I think these guys have some great things in store for them, so make sure you head on over and check them out.
So on behalf of everyone here at duanestorey.com (yah I know, it‚Äôs only me), I want to congratulate Maura, Danny, Alexa, Jordan, Lyal, and the rest of the Strutta team, on their accomplishments. Best of luck guys. ...

                    Last Friday I met a pile of people from the Vancouver technology scene down at the Lamplighter pub in Gastown. Apparently that location is surrounded in controversy, since the Lamplighter has recently changed hands and has been transformed into a more ‚Äúmodern‚Äù establishment. I can‚Äôt say that I ever hung out in it before, but it seemed like a pretty cool place on Friday.
I would have shown up and mingled regardless, but on Friday I volunteered to drop by and take some photos of the Vancouver Technology Women for this year. That list was put together by none other than blogger-extraordinaire, ...

                    Tonight I went down to the Republic to partake in the second Launch Party. It‚Äôs basically a mixer for technology enthusiasts, and an opportunity for a few startups to showcase their new products.
There were about 150 people that probably showed up, and it got rather tight and cramped at times, but it was cool meeting a lot of the people involved, and hanging out with a few old friends.

The Sxip GirlsI‚Äôm still on some drugs, so I refrained from drinking, which was actually rather nice in a way since I spent $0 at the function tonight.
Maura On TelevisionI‚Äôm not really sure why the TV people ...

I haven‚Äôt been out to one of these in a long time, mainly because I‚Äôve been feeling a bit under the weather for the last few months, but I think I‚Äôm going to check it out tomorrow.
Launch Party recently launched a new website, and if you look very, very closely, you may recognize the header image on it üôÇ
So, hopefully I‚Äôll still feel like heading out tomorrow. I will be good to catch up with some old tech friends and see what‚Äôs new. Plus, it gives me an excuse to ...
