I’ve seen a few rumour sites suggest that Apple is preparing to seed developers with an early 10.6 release of their operating system. You can read about it here. If true, it sounds like it’s more of a maintenance/stability release, which makes me really wonder why they would name it a 10.6 instead of a 10.5.4. And to be honest, I’d be really disappointed if they were to release 10.6 as a real, full fledged (i.e. you have to pay more money) update to the operating system, considering Leopard isn’t that old and that it’s far from stable as it is.
It’s obviously just a rumour, so I’m ...

                    Ever since I upgraded to Leopard a few months ago, I’ve been plagued with disk space issues on my Macbook Pro. Normally, when shooting photographs, you use your hard drive as permanent storage and your compact flash cards as temporary storage. I had so little space on my hard drive during the Junos though that I was forced to reverse the two, and was literally using extra CF cards to make up the hard drive difference.
Today I sat down to see if I could figure out where it all went. The key application I used was Disk Inventory X, a great little tool that graphically displays where all your space ...

                    I’ve been using Leopard now for around 3 months, and to be honest, I’m really not impressed at all. It’s an extremely buggy OS with a bunch of mediocre improvements, many of which I haven’t really found a use for.
Spaces? I actually thought these would be cool, but I just haven’t been able to find a good use for them. In fact, I find myself accidentally switching between spaces from time to time thanks to how heavily I rely on the control and option keys for other things.
Stacks is another completely useless feature, mainly because you can’t really see enough icons. Plus, it’s generally ...

                    For all of you people who upgraded to Leopard and are using GMail, you have have noticed a few weird things going on. For me, my contacts no longer auto complete properly, and periodically all the javascript in gmail stops working.
I’ve checked a lot of newsgroups and many people are having the same problems. Apparently gmail has tried moving to a newer version that isn’t really compatible with Safari 3.0 yet. The solution is to just go up to the top right in gmail and click “old version”, which will roll back your GMail version to one that does work with Safari.
You’re welcome 🙂 ...

                    I know for a fact that Leopard seems to work fine with Apple’s router, but I’ve been having a lot of problems with Leopard and my Linksys Wireless N router here at home. Once and a while it will just give itself a self-assigned IP address and that’s that. The only way to fix it is to reboot my Mac and my router, which usually causes it to grab a real one. Funny thing is I can switch to my neighbours connection (sssh, don’t tell), and it works fine even in that state, so it’s something about the Linksys it doesn’t like.
Seems like there’s a problem with 10.5.1 and some wireless routers. ...

                    I’ve been waiting patiently for this update, since I’ve had quite a few problems with wireless since switching to Leopard. I also need to drop my Mac off at the repair facility to probably replace the logic board in it, since I’ve been having weird LCD and sleep problems on my Mac. Unfortunately, there seems to be over a week delay at MacStation for even looking at these things, which means I’ll basically be computerless for a while. I’m sure I’ll survive, but will be weird not to have a computer at home. Maybe I can go back to doing “normal” things again for a while.
