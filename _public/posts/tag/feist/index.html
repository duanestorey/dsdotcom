                    I was going through some of my old videos tonight, and realized I have a pile that I haven’t uploaded yet. Here’s one of Feist singing 1234 at the BC Festival 150 in Victoria.

                    This morning we woke up at 6am in order to catch the 8am ferry back to Vancouver. I don’t think my head hit the pillow until around 1am, so needless to say I was pretty exhausted this morning. I’ve been trying to watch my caffeine intake over the last few weeks, and I definitely had a bunch this weekend. So even though I’m really beat today, I’m trying hard to not have any more caffeine.
In terms of the concert, it was easily one of the best events I’ve been to in a very long time. We spent most of yesterday bouncing between watching concerts, walking around in the sun, and sampling ...

                    I went for a walk this afternoon down to the mall to buy a few new shirts. When I got there, I fielded a SMS message from John Biehler saying he was heading to the Apple store and asked if I wanted to meet up. I met him and Peter there, after which time we all headed down to the new Crumpler store on the edge of Gastown.
I’ve always wanted a Crumpler bag, but they were hard to come by in Vancouver. So today I picked up a new camera bag with the intention of taking it to Victoria tomorrow. Here’s what it looks like:

I opted for the smaller of the two bags they had, and I’m already regretting ...

                    Update – Hotwire came through for me again. We’re going to be staying at the Magnolia Luxury Boutique Hotel right in Inner Harbour. So exciting. 
The other day Arieanna contacted me via Twitter and asked if I wanted a photo pass for the festivities this weekend in Victoria. Since I haven’t been to Victoria in a few years, I thought it might be a good opportunity to sample some island beer and take some photos.

Sometimes photo passes just let you get your camera in the door, and aren’t really anything special. However, Arieanna just got confirmation that our passes include access to the ...

                    I’m sure many of you know already know who Leslie Feist is. She’s one of Canadian’s most recognized young musicians now, thanks to obvious talent and also having her song 1-2-3-4 included in one of Apple’s largest marketing campaigns.
If I remember correctly, Feist snagged five awards at the Junos, which is as close to a landslide as you can really have at an event like that. I unfortunately didn’t get to meet her (she was rather popular that night), but I did get to hang out a few feet away from her and snap a few photos.

I was doing some reading in my RSS reader this morning and came ...
