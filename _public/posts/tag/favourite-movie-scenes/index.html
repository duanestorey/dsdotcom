                    I hung out with some of my old high school friends tonight at a little Christmas dinner, and a few people brought up my recent blog posts about favourite movies scenes. We immediately launched into a big discussion about which other scenes were pretty awesome from our childhood memories, and I think we ended up with a list of about 20 or 30.
First movie we talked about was one Brennen and I totally loved years ago: Tombstone. Here’s is the scene where Johnny Ringo and Doc Holliday have their final battle. Obvious spoilers ahead.
I’m your huckleberry. ...

                    Heat is a totally awesome movie starring both Al Pacino and Robert Deniro. There are many classic scenes in it, but one that stands out is the coffee shop banter between Pacino and Deniro where we learn a pile about both characters. This type of scene has been used in countless movies since then, but they all basically pay homage to this part.
Why I think it’s so fascinating is that both characters open up to each other and somehow relate, even though they are basically enemies by trade. And let’s be honest, Deniro and Pacino both kick ass. ...

                    Easily one of my top ten films ever (well maybe top 20) is the rare gem that is Cameron Crowe’s “Almost Famous.” If you haven’t seen it, you should immediately head out to the movie store and rent it. It’s full of touching moments, laughter, self discovery and even a dash of romance.
Not only is the writing and story telling superb, but the photography and cinematography are both outstanding. I’ll post a few scenes here I really like (obvious spoilers).
The scene on the bus after the Golden God bit is also classic:
It’s all happening folks. ...

                    There are so many incredible scenes in The Lord Of The Rings, it’s really difficult to single any of them out. The books were pretty influential in my early childhood, as well as shaping some of my literary and cinematic preferences in my teens. I am totally a LOTR geek, and even wore a little ring around my neck for a few months after reading the series for the first time. Actually, the first thing you see when you walk in the door at my Vancouver apartment is a framed poster of Aragorn from The Return of the King (so cool, I know).
When the movies came out, I was totally excited, and ended ...

                    No, the number 1 doesn’t mean this is my all time favourite movie scene, because I plan to post a lot of these over the next few weeks, and I haven’t even thought about ranking them yet. However, I’ve always really liked this one scene. I could care less if you hate Tom Cruise or think his religion is bogus (even though it is) — this scene is pretty high up there in terms of cinematic perfection in my mind.
As a whole, Vanilla Sky wasn’t that great, but this last scene, with the music, the wisps of romance, the vibrant vanilla sky, the New York landscape, and the thought of what it must ...

                    The original Star Wars Trilogy really needs no introduction, so I won’t really say much about it except that it totally kicked ass, as would any trilogy involving a bad guy voiced by James Earl Jones.
This scene is a classic battle scene involving Luke and Darth Vadar, where of course Luke loses his hand at the end and ultimately learns who his real father is. And seriously, pretty much every kid who ever watches this scene spends the rest of their lives making lightsaber noises whenever they swing anything. Hell, I even hold out my hand when I approach automatic doors and pretend I’m using ...
