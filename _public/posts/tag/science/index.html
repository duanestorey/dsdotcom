The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all art and science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead; his eyes are closed.
The release of atomic energy has not created a new problem. It has merely made more urgent the necessity of solving an existing one.
Strange is our situation here on earth. Each of us comes for a short visit, not knowing why, yet sometimes seeming to divine a purpose. From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know: that man is here ...

                    1977, in front of the House Agriculture Subcommittee of Domestic Marketing, talking about the recent recommendations by the USDA and Food and Nutrition Board towards a low-fat diet:

However tenuous that linkage, however disappointing the various intervention trials, it still seems prudent to propose to the American public that we not only maintain reasonable weights for our height, body structure and age, but also reduce our dietary fat intakes significantly, and keep cholesterol to a minimum. And, conceivably, you might conclude that it is proper for the federal government to so recommend.

                    In 1977, the same year I was born, NASA launched the Voyager 1 spacecraft with a mission to explore our solar system. It is still operational, and is located some 9.3 billion miles from the sun. At that distance, light (including radio waves) takes nearly 14 hours to reach our planet. By comparison, light from the sun takes about 8 minutes to get to earth.
17 years later, as voyager passed beyond the edge of our solar system, engineers at NASA turned the Voyager 1 spacecraft around, pointed it towards earth, and took a few shots of our planet. This is one of them.

                    I’m just gonna jot this here in case anyone is interested in this sort of stuff. On saturday night, there will be a total eclipse of the moon, visible from all seven continents..

Set aside some time this weekend for sky watching.
On Saturday night, March 3rd, there’s going to be a total eclipse of the
Moon. This means the Moon will glide through the heart of Earth’s
shadow and turn a beautiful shade of sunset red. Totality can be seen
from parts of all seven continents including all of Europe and Africa
and the eastern half of North America.
