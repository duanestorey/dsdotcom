                    Today I had a specialist appointment to fully quantify the damage to my vision from my accident last year. The appointment was about an hour of waiting in the waiting room, twiddling my thumbs, and an hour of experiments. They were forced to dilate my eyes, which means not only am I totally sensitive to light right now, but I‚Äôm having a very hard time reading anything.

  
Not sure the verdict, but it‚Äôs looking pretty likely that my double vision in my upgaze is probably permanent. I can potentially compensate for this by changing my eyeglass prescription to have a slight upward taper in the ...

                    I finally got a hold of my doctor back in Vancouver today to try to figure out what‚Äôs wrong with me and what I can do about it. It turns out that I have a fairly serious infection caused by a bacteria called ‚Äúclostridium difficile.‚Äù C. Difficile sometimes lives in the intestines and is normally kept in check by a range of good bacteria that also live there. Unfortunately, as a result of the antibiotic treament I had in the hospital (which was clindamycin I believe), a large portion of the good bacteria have died off, leaving a pile of bad stuff to proliferate:

Ever since being discharged from the hospital, I‚Äôve had some pretty bad digestive problems. It started with just your run of the mill diarrhea, but has slowly gotten worse over the last month. Lately I‚Äôve been waking up a bit crampy, and have to hit the bathroom fairly often during the day right now.
I spent the other evening searching on the internet, and finally pinned it down to antibiotic associated diarrhea, due mainly to the IV and oral antibiotics I had while fighting pneumonia:

‚ÄúWe found that one or more sodas per day increases your risk of new-onset metabolic syndrome by about 45 per cent, and it did not seem to matter if it was regular or diet,‚Äù Dr. Ramachandran Vasan, senior investigator for the Framingham Heart Study, said Monday from Boston.

                    This morning I went downstairs and checked the mail, and was surprised to see a bill from the ministry of health. It would seem that the government wants me to pay for the ambulance that took me to the hospital the night I ended up with multiple lacerations to my head and face, and five broken bone segments in my face. While I‚Äôm obviously appreciative for our medical system, considering I have had two surgeries now that I haven‚Äôt had to pay for, given that our health care system is supposed to be covered, I‚Äôm pretty surprised that I have to pay this at all.

                    A few blog posts ago, I mentioned that I was going to do my best to return back to my pre-last-relationship weight. To that end, I have spent the last week hitting the gym from time to time and attempting to watch what I eat. The first week has been a bit rocky, and I hit a few tasty speed bumps at Rebecca‚Äôs Cinqo de Mayo party, but for the most part I‚Äôve been on track. Since my life is a bit crazy thesedays, it‚Äôs challenging for me to always have access to ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù food, but I‚Äôve been doing the best I can.
So without further ado, the progress after week #1 is (RSS drum roll please):

However, that all changed sometime around 2003 when a prestigious medical school released a peer-reviewed study that basically showed Low Carbohyrate diets not only help people lose more weight, but also result in better blood-lipid profiles than their low-fat counterparts.
Since then, I‚Äôve read countless studies on PubMed that basically indicate the same thing. However,
