The following is a guest post by Tia Everitt from Chilliwack — thanks for the contribution

Chilliwack.
It was the one place my husband and I swore up and down that we would NEVER, EVER live.
It was a place we raced through on the highway, en route to the Okanagan, or to get back to Vancouver. We plugged our noses as we gagged on the cloying, ever-present stench of cow manure. We snickered at the tacky billboards all the way in and out of the Fraser Valley. We made jokes about inbreeding. We chuckled at the omnipresent “Corn Barns” that dotted the landscape in the summer. From time to time ...

                    This is my second last entry, which means Blogathon is almost over. This was was definitely a lot harder for me than the one last year, mainly because I started the event already in a pretty exhausted state. But no matter – the end is near.
I’m sitting on the couch here at Workspace, watching the start of another sunrise. By the time this day is over for me, I will have seen two sunrises, a gorgeous sunset, and even a lightning storm. Not a bad day at the office if I do say so myself.
With everyone’s help, we raised approximately $1250 for the BC Children’s Hospital Foundation, and for ...

                    Well, thus ends Blogathon 2009 – it was quite the adventure, one that I’m glad I was a part of again. The official Blogathon website shows approximately $40,000 raised for the various charities this weekend, which is totally awesome. Of that amount, approximately $1,250 was raised by the content on this blog, and by the people who supported my efforts and the BC Children’s Hospital Foundation. So once again, you guys all have my sincerest thanks.
But while the donations and money are obviously appreciated, this event is about more than money. It’s about a group of people banding together ...

                    In less than 8 hours, Blogathon 2009 will begin. I’m currently hanging out at Rebecca’s house, watching Stand By Me and eating popcorn. I started working on a little spreadsheet of blog entries for tomorrow, but only filled in about 15 spots or so, which means the other 34 will have to be decided sometime tomorrow.
To be honest, I’m fairly beat. I don’t even recall last year’s Blogathon at this point, although I do remember hanging out at my place with Rebecca, John and Raul, sometime around midnight. I imagine somehow I’ll make it to the end tomorrow, but at this point I think it’s ...

                    Welcome everyone the Blogathon 2009! Over the next 24 hours, I will be consuming insane amounts of caffeine while writing blog entries in an effort to generate some exposure and hopefully a bit of financial support for the charity of my choosing, the BC Children’s Hospital Foundation.
I can’t imagine many things worse in this world then being a parent and watching your child get sick. The BC Children’s Hospital is known Canada wide for the work they do with children, which is why I’ve chosen it this year as my charity of choice.
I decided on the way to Workspace this morning that I was ...

                    When Apple introduced the iPhone 3GS, they added a new piece of hardware: a magnetometer. That little do-dad can pick up magnetic field lines, and basically act as a virtual compass.
While kind of a neat feature, I don’t think it’s very practical. I mean, pretty much every iPhone 3G user I know has the data plan, which basically means they can access Google Maps whenever they want. Yes, you can’t get a real time indication of your direction using Google maps, but if you move around you can obviously watch what happens and see which direction you are facing. But to be honest, it’s pretty ...

                    Another great city that I’m fortunate enough to spend a lot of time visiting is San Francisco, California. I was recently down there in June for a big WordPress conference, and will probably be down there again in a few months I imagine. Here’s a shot I took of San Francisco about a year ago from just north of the Golden Gate Bridge.

I also just picked up a few diet cokes. Which means that today so far I’ve had three coffees, and one 500ml diet coke. Here’s a shot of the current carnage:

                    I’m no old timer yet, but I’m definitely past the point where’d I’d consider myself a spring chicken. This year is really the first year where I’ve noticed any grey hairs, and is also the first year where I’m starting to recognize the odd pain. One in particular, a sharp pain in the heel on my left foot, tends to cause me some grief. Years ago I jumped off a big wall and landed pretty hard on my feet. I never got it looked at, but I’m fairly certain I cracked my heel bone, since I basically had to limp for around four weeks. Unfortunately, I now wake up with a sharp pain in the same ...

                    A bunch of us are currently hanging out down in Gastown at a little place called Workspace. Because of how important Blogathon is and the amount of dedication involved by the participants, several organizations have offered to sponsor the event, namely in the area of food.

The first sponsor of today’s event is Dairy Queen, and they’ll be supplying all of us with burgers, fries, chicken strips, sundaes, blizzards, and onion rings. Back in high school, I had a bit of a crush on a girl who worked at Dairy Queen. Given that we went to different schools, and the only chance I’d have to run into ...

                    A lot of my fellow bloggers around here have installed WordTwit today so that they can have their WordPress posts automatically show up on their Twitter feeds. While WordTwit doesn’t officially support hashtags yet (those crazy things that look like #someword on Twitter), there’s a quick little work around for events such as Blogathon.
First, navigate to the WordTwit administration panel. Typically you’ll see something like this under general options:

The trick is to edit that text such that the hashtag you’d like to be added is automatically inserted after each post. So for the case ...

I’ll list the people who have indicated that they don’t mind their name being given out. Right now, I’m sitting at about the $750 mark $1,000 mark, which is great considering I’m only about 1/3 of the way through the event. Here’s a list of the current donators:

                    Without a doubt, one of my favorite events to shoot is a sunset. I used to live a stone’s throw away from the Pacific Ocean, and walking down and watching the sun set was pretty much a weekly or a semi-weekly event during the summers. I know that many photographers think that sunset photos are a bit cliche, but I’ve never thought so. To me, watching the sun set highlights some of the real beauty of this world, and reminds me of all the great things that bring me joy in it.
So, here are a few of my favorite sunset photos that I’ve taken over the years:

                    This entry represents post 18 out of a total of 49. So, I still have a fairly long ways to go. To be honest, I was pretty beat when I woke up, and feeling pretty worn out around 9:30am or so, but thankfully I seem to have gotten another wind. I’ve been consuming diet pop like it’s going out of style, so that might have something to do with it. Or perhaps, it could be the big bottle of water I also started drinking in an effort to rehydrate myself. Whatever it is that’s keeping me going, I sure hope it lasts for a while.

                    My friend Kelly sent me along this information, and I wanted to share it with everyone. Apparently Shaw Cable has been aggressively trying to hurt Novus in the Vancouver market. Here’s some information from the 10buckstoo.com website:
Shaw has been offering residents in buildings wired for Novus wildly aggressive rates that it’s not offering anyone else. This appears to be an attempt to eliminate Novus, its only local cable TV competition, which is unethical and unfair.
One of these offers is selling their Shaw Digital TV with:

For many families, the BC Children’s Hospital becomes a second home for a period time, often while they are helping a child of theirs get back to help:

                    I was one of the first people in Vancouver to experiment with HDR (high dynamic range) photography a few years ago. I definitely wasn’t *the* first, because I actually got a bit of inspiration from a few other photographers in Vancouver who had been dabbling with HDR.
For yucks, I thought I would include the very first HDR shot I ever put together. It’s a shot of Vancouver on a really storm day. I shot it from my balcony using a tripod, and merged three photos together using a tool on the Mac called Photomatix. Here’s the end result:

Things definitely seem a bit less active around here right now, probably because everyone’s stomachs are all full of food now. I wouldn’t be surprised though if people are losing a bit of stream — we’ve all been at this nearly 8 hours already, and still have 16 hours to go. If my brain were a car engine right now, it would probably be firing on only one cylinder. I’ve been having a hard time constructing complete sentences ...
