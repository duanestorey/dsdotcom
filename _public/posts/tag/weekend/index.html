                    A while ago I decided that I would take a little break and have a little ‘me time’. I’ve bounced around a few ideas in my head, and ultimately come up with a pretty good weekend adventure. I’ve been keeping the actual location to myself, simply because I want to just disappear for a few days, put the cell phone on vibrate, and get in a little rest and relaxation.
The last vacation I took was back at the end of last November, so it’s been nearly six months without a break. I don’t really feel like I need a week off at this point, but a nice relaxing weekend adventure complete with a ...

                    Other than the two days I spent down in Oregon a while ago, I really haven’t taken any time off this summer. Truthfully, I’m a bit bagged to be honest. We had a couple big projects on the go there, and thankfully they’re pretty much done at this point. I’ll be doing up a posting on BraveNewCode next week talking a bit about some of the recent things we’ve been involved in.
In the meantime though I’m shutting everything off that beeps or glows and going to enjoy this weekend reading books and watching movies. Anything that doesn’t involve typing. ...

                    About a month ago I got an email from Coast Hotels asking if I’d like to partake in an all-inclusive weekend in Victoria with a few other bloggers and social media people from Vancouver. Given how much fun I had in Victoria last summer with Arieanna and Ianiv for the BC Festival 150 concert, I jumped at the opportunity, especially since Coast Hotels was supplying the accommodation and transportation.

The trip will start off on Friday morning at the Coast Hotel in Vancouver — everyone is meeting and boarding a bus for the Tsawwassen Ferry terminal. From there, we’ll all travel to the Tsawwassen ...

                    This is the first weekend in ages where I really don’t have a pile of plans. Given that it’s absolutely horrible outside, I think I’m going to get some groceries, make some coffee, and watch movies on the couch most of the weekend.
If I do watch a movie, I’ll probably pop in the extended edition of the Fellowship Of The Ring, since I haven’t watched it in ages. What better way to spend your weekend than going on a 12 hour journey into the heart of Middle Earth?

Right now I’m working from home, waiting patiently for the guys at Pender Auto Body to come grab me so I can pick up my car. ...

                    Tonight I met up with the gang to celebrate Amy’s birthday down at Wing’s on Granville Street. We had a few pitchers of beer and demolished somewhere on the order of 16 pounds of wings as a group (I’m now officially “winged out”, so I probably won’t go back there for a while). It was tons of fun, even though I ate that one hot wing that melted my mouth.


Afterwards we ended up down at the Bowling Alley on Granville and played a few games. My head was still a tad sore from the night before (the danger of drinking for free at a bar), so my game was a bit off.

I took a pile of photos ...

                    Yesterday I didn’t really have much time to blog, and I doubt I will today either. I’ve just been a bit busy with everything.
Looking outside right now, it looks like there’s an official snow line in the mountains around downtown, which probably means skiing and snowboarding will start soon. It’s a fairly nice day in Vancouver (in fact, it’s been really nice this winter so far), and you can check out a live feed if you want at KatKam.ca:

                    Well, here we are, at the end of another week. I’m so looking forward to relaxing a bit. There’s a show tonight down at the Media Club I might go check out, but I haven’t decided yet. Other than that, I’m probably going to stay close to home and get caught up on rest. December will probably be filled with lots of Christmas type things and a few parties, so I’m going to do my best not to wear myself down this month, considering I’m still on antibiotics. Good news is I saw a guy this morning who knows his stuff, and he said I should be fine and is gonna mix things up again. So in theory ...

I’m so far behind on everything, it’s not even funny. Being in the hospital set me back over a week, and my recent trip out east set me back even further. I’m going to try and use this weekend to catch up. Here’s what I need to do.

Tidy apartment and do laundry. I hate this part.
Unfuck photoshop some how
Mail photos to everyone
Backup computer and free some space
Install XP via boot camp so I can play games
Finish wedding photos for Mike and Kim (sorry guys)
Answer a bazillion emails that I haven’t yet. If I haven’t answered you, I’m sorry 🙁 If I have, feel lucky!
Drink ...
