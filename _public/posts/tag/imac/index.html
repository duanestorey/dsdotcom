I just realized I don’t own any glasses, just mugs
My plants are all dead or dying
My christmas tree is still up
I don’t look at bills before I pay them, I typically just pay a random amount and hope it’s right
I’ve lived in my current apartment for two and a half years, and I still don’t have a bedroom suite or a dresser for my clothes
I have the boxes for my iMac and my Macbook pro still in the corner of my living room. They make me happy
I collect wine. But I don’t really drink it.
I get groceries once a month, and my fridge is about 50% beer
I have nine cores worth of computing ...

                    I set up my computer to do backups using Apple’s Time Machine a while ago. The good news is that it appears to be working just fine. The bad news is it seems to fire up my external USB drive far more than I would like, especially during the evenings. Since my iMac is right in my bedroom, the spinning, chugging drive doesn’t make my sleep situation any better. If I can’t find a way to dial down how often it does a backup, I might have to look at getting a quieter drive. ...

                    I was walking around my apartment this evening, and came to the realization that I have a ton of computer equipment. So much in fact that some of it is piled is various corners of my place. Here’s a small list of what I have sitting around:
1) iMac Core2-Duo 2.0 GHz Desktop
2) Macbook Pro Core2-Duo 1.8 GHz Laptop
3) Intel based 1.6 GHz mini-server running debian linux
4) Quad Core 2.4 GHz Centos-based mini-server with 1 TB raid 5 storage (I use this for storing photos and other things I don’t want to lose)
5) External 350 GB USB 2.0 drive, used for time machine backups
6) Apple TV
7) External ...

                    My iMac has been a bit slow when using photoshop or garageband, so today, after picking up Hesty from the airport, I stopped at NCIX and picked up some more memory for it.
When I got home, I actually had a hard time figuring out just where the memory went. I finally found out where — there’s a little panel on the very bottom of the iMac that comes off easily with one screw. After that, you just slide in the SODIMM chip and you’re up and running again in just a few minutes. Pretty slick, especially compared to how much trouble it was to upgrade the Mac Mini at work (I actually had to use ...

                    As everyone knows, I’ve spent the last six months battling my Macbook Pro. It’s been plagued with various problems, the most severe of which lately is intermittent connectivity wherever I go. Not coming back whenever it sleeps it pretty lame too.
Anyways, I went to drop it off at the repair facility, and they said it would be gone for at least two weeks. So, being the impulsive buyer that I am, I decided to pick up an iMac for home. And to be honest, I used to always use a desktop computer, even though I had a Windows laptop before. But when I got my Mac, I ended up formatting my Windows machine ...

                    Well, now that I’ve gotten all my weekend fun out of the way, I think I’m going to take it easy and relax. Of course, the first thing I’m going to do is warm up some left over lasagna, but then I have a bunch of web work I really want to get done. Plus, Sunday is usually laundry day, and I need to catch up on that.

  
I set up by Gmail/IMAP account on my Apple Mac Mail program. I’m not sure if I’m going to use it though. At least for me, it seems pretty slow. Not only does it seem to take forever to sync, but the CPU is fairly high even with the Mail program is idling. It might be related ...
