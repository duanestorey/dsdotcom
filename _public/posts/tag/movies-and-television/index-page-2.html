                    Today I went out for a nice walk, thinking I was going to get a few housewares for my place, and maybe pick up a new shirt or two. While out and about, I decided to swing by Future Shop and see what was new and exciting. When I walked in, I headed over to the DVD player area to see if anything was happening in the Blue-Ray or HD-DVD markets, since I’ve been looking to pick something up for a while.
Last week, there was a sale on the highly regarded Toshiba HD-A2 DVD player for $399, and I almost picked one up. However, that was still a little steep for my liking, and I decided to pass on it. ...

                    Today I met a few people down at the Paramount Theatre to watch the new Transformers movie. Rebecca, John Bollwitt, John Biehler and a few others (from the Facebook group we set up) all showed up to hear the infamous “cho-choo-cho-choo” transformation sound, and see Optimus up on the big screen again.

What we immediately commented on is that despite 21 people replying and saying they were coming, only seven or so showed up. After discussing it for a while, we sort of came to the conclusion that it’s pretty easy to just accept an invitation ...

                    Ok, it seems like almost 90% of all traffic hitting my website in the last week or so has been related to a blog posting I did a few months ago on the forth coming Transformers movie by Michael Bay. For those of you living in a cave, Michael Bay (director of Armageddon and Pearl Harbour) chose to turn the lovable, clickable toys from the 1980’s into a full-fledged, live-action movie.

The movie premieres on June 20th around the world, and opens on July 3rd here in North America. If you head over to Ain’t it Cool News, you can check out a few early reviews from people who have seen it already.

                    On Friday, I met up briefly with Rebecca down at the Six Acres in Gastown for a few drinks on a patio. It was a good way to start a Friday afternoon, and since I had only woken up a few hours prior, I was definitely in the mood to drink and grab something to eat. Afterwards, we went down to the west-end for some pizza, and to hang out with John, who was busy playing with Dave Olsen’s new microphone on his computer.
A bunch of my new blogger-type friends (most of which I originally ran into down at Northern Voice) were down at DemoCamp the other day, but unfortunately I wasn’t feeling up to ...

                    Ok, so this is super geeky, but as a kid I used to love playing Transformers. For those of you who don’t know, Michael Bay (Armageddon) has been working on a full length action movie about the transformers, and it’s coming out July 4th.

The new exclusive trailer was just released a few minutes ago on Yahoo, and it looks pretty wild. It will probably suck as a movie, but it should be entertaining.
Check it out here.
