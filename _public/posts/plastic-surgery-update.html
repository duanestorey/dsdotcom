                    <p>I just got back from an appointment with my plastic surgeon. After two surgeries, I am still left with a few problems, the first of which is a slight visual dissimilarity between my left and right eye, and the second is double vision above my mid line.</p>
                    <p>Based on some recent measurements I had done, my surgeon proposed four courses of action:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Do nothing</li>
                        <li>Remove a bit of skin from eyelid on my “good” eye to make it sort of match the appearance of my “bad” eye</li>
                        <li>Adjust the eyelid of my “bad” eye to make it better match my “good” eye.</li>
                        <li>Open me back up and either adjust the current implant, augment it with another piece of plastic, or rebuild the orbital floor using a titanium mesh</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>So, it’s decision time. I have no idea what I’m going to do, but since option #4 has the ability to restore my vision to close to perfection as well as the appearance, it’s the one I’m leaning towards right now, even though it’s slightly riskier than the others. Options #2 and #3 just seem like hacks to me, and if they don’t work there’s no going back. Even though full on surgery is a pain, in theory every operation can be undone just be removing the offending implants, which just somehow seems like a better option.</p>
                    <p>I don’t have to make a decision for some time, so I’m going to think about it a bit more. I’m currently scheduled to have a full MRI done of my left eye out at UBC to see the scarring of my eye muscles along with the current position of the implants. Based on that, my doctor will better be able to gauge the potential outcome if we go ahead with another surgery.</p>
                    <p>The wait time on the MRI is a few months, so it’s unlikely that anything will happen before the spring. But in a few months I’ll know more. So it seems that this journey isn’t completely over yet.</p>
