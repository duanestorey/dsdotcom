                <p>Well, maybe not *above*, but at least *at* Starbucks. Feels weird being back into the groove again to be honest. I have never been on a two week vacation before, and it’s strange coming back again and trying to fire the engines up again, especially when the engines have been soaked in beer for two weeks.</p>
<p>I’m down at my local Starbucks in Vedder Crossing here trying to get everything in order so that I can hit everything hard again starting tomorrow. I started the evening with 400 messages in my inbox, and am down to around 15 now, which is a nice improvement. Once my inbox gets past about 50 messages, I start losing track of things I’ve replied to, so I like having it down to a more manageable level.</p>
<p>Dale and I planned out a six month strategy for BraveNewCode over the holidays, and tomorrow we’re going to start executing on it. Lots of exciting things coming down the pipe, and I don’t plan on sharing any of them until we’re done. But definitely <a href="http://www.bravenewcode.com">follow along with us</a>, especially if you’re using WordPress or any of our plugins (WPtouch, WordTwit, etc.).</p>
<p>I managed to hit the gym quite a few times while down in the Dominican, enough that I didn’t feel super guilty drinking beer most evenings. Thankfully when I got back I was the exact same weight I was when I left, so my strategy seemed to have worked. I’ve been to the gym twice here since getting back, and plan on trying to go five days a week again starting tomorrow. I’m pretty sure I get a free consult at the gym, so I’ll probably take advantage of it and try to get some kind of realistic five-day workout plan going.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who gave me some new music suggestions — I’m going to start buying/borrowing some of them over the next few weeks. Anyways, back at it.</p>
