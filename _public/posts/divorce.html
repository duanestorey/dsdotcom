<blockquote>
<p>A 43-year-old German decided to settle his imminent divorce by chainsawing a family home in two and making off with his half in a forklift truck.</p>
<p>Police in the eastern town of Sonneberg said on Friday the trained mason measured the single-storey summer house — which was some 8 meters (26 feet) long and 6 meters wide — before chainsawing through the wooden roof and walls.</p>
<p>“The man said he was just taking his due,” said a police spokesman. “But I don’t think his wife was too pleased.”</p>
<p>After finishing the job, the man picked up his half with the forklift truck and drove to his brother’s house where he has since been staying.</p>
