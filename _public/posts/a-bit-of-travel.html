                    <p>I wrote a blog entry a few weeks ago where I toyed with the idea of maybe doing some traveling in the next year or so. While sitting on the couch here today watching movies, I started thinking about that idea more and more.</p>
                    <p>The reality is that I can work from anywhere. All I need is a backpack with some clothes in it and my trusty MacBook Pro, and there’s really no reason why I couldn’t work from any little coffee shop I encounter. Now that my car and student loans are mostly paid off, my monthly expenses have dropped significantly.</p>
                    <p>In an ideal world, I’d be able to rent my apartment out furnished and go on a working vacation for a few months. Unfortunately, I suspect that renting a furnished apartment isn’t very appealing out in the country here, as you don’t really get a lot of business travelers where that makes sense. But given how my lease is up in January, I could simply move my stuff into a local storage facility here for a while.</p>
                    <p>It’s something I’ve always wanted to do to be honest, and it seems like the opportunity is sitting right there in front of me waiting to be grabbed. I remember reading how <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com">Darren and his wife</a> went to Malta for a while, and that seems like a pretty cool adventure.</p>
                    <p>I’ve been telling my friend in Serbia I was going to visit him for years now, so it’s definitely a place I’d like to end up, especially during the summer and Exit Festival. Also, I bought a book on Montenegro last year, and it’s a place I’d like to visit as well. If anyone has any great ideas for somewhere to go that has a cheap cost of living and reliable internet access, please drop me a line.</p>
