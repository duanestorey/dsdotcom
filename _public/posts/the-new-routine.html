                <p>Part of the reason I moved back to Chilliwack was so that I can finally have the proper time to eat decent food and hopefully get some exercise on a regular basis. While my current apartment is the only place I ended up considering, part of the reason I did so was because it’s only about a 5 minute walk from a gym. And while I did my best to go outside and get exercise in Vancouver, I generally worked a lot of hours and didn’t really have a ton of time. I’ve had a gym membership out here since about April, but haven’t really been going more than once or twice a week. My main problem is that I’m not really much of a morning person, and by the time the evening rolled around, I always found myself pretty tired.</p>
<p>Last week I decided to try setting my alarm for 7am to see if I could manage to go to the gym then. The first day was actually surprisingly easy, most likely because I had a really frustrating sleep and was ready to get up anyways. Other than day two (where I actually hit snooze a few times), I’ve gone to the gym at 7am pretty much every day for the last week and a bit. Surprisingly it’s something I actually look forward to in the mornings at this point. I’m generally back home around 8am, at which point I take a shower, cook a decent breakfast, then do a bit of reading with a coffee. Somewhere around 8:45 or so I hop online and sync up with Dale.</p>
<p>At least for the foreseeable future I’m going to try and keep the routine up. In addition, I’ve been trying to also fit in something small in the evenings as well. Tonight I went for a 30 minute rollerblade around my neighborhood, but I’ve also been hitting a tennis court occasionally and practicing a bit. I’m going to keep most of the fitness activities confined to the weekdays I think, since I’m hoping to start doing some road trips and/or camping trips pretty soon on the weekends.</p>
<p>So, with any luck I’ll slowly start wasting away here over the summer.</p>
