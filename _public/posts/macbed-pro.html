                <p>So last week I decided that I was going to try and break my whole staying up late, getting up late routine and actually make an effort to go to bed early and get up early. For the most part (except for getting in a bit later today, which is excusable but unfortunately not bloggable), I’ve been keeping to a routine of hitting the sack around 11, reading on my laptop until 11:30 or so, and getting up at 7am.</p>
<p>Now, I have a queen sized bed. I’ve had one for years now I guess, ever since university. But the funny thing is, I will never ever be able to sleep like I have a queen sized bed. For the most part, I curl up in a ball and stick to my one side, even on the nights where I toss and turn. When I clean my sheets, one side is always crumpled and messy, and the other is relatively pristine. It’s almost sad in a way, since it’s a constant reminder that half of my bed is perpetually empty. Sure, I could probably switch sides from time to time, but then not only would I not have a blog entry, but it would also just be weird sleeping on that side of the bed. I guess when you’re in a relationship everone forms little sleeping habits, and mine unfortunately are hard to break.</p>
<p>So, since I’m now trying to read more in bed, both in the morning when I wake up, and at night before I go to bed, I’ve sort of gotten in the habit of just letting my laptop sleep beside me. I don’t really have a night table (well it’s more like a filing cabinet, but it has a fan on it, which I sometimes turn on just to help me sleep), so it’s either getting up to put my laptop on my desk, or just setting it beside me and passing out when I’m tired. So, lately I just slide it to the other side of the bed, roll over and hit the hay. When I wake up, it’s always still got lots of battery power (having actually been in “sleep” mode most of the night, unlike my Vista box which still runs full tilt when sleeping), so I can flip it on and slowly regain consciousness over the morning news.</p>
<p>Would I rather have a warm body sleeping against me every night instead of a warm battery? You bet. But for now it will have to do.</p>
