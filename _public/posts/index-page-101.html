They had some good martini specials, and even though I don’t like martinis, I managed to down one before I was forced to switch to beers. After we were slightly drunk, we made our way up to Doolins for another drink, and then I headed over to the Morrisey with Tiffany and her friend Jenn. I had a really great time hanging out with them, and we finished the night with three jumbo things of poutine down at Fritz on Davie.

                    An update from spaceweather:
HARVEST MOON: Tonight’s full moon has a special name–the “Harvest
Moon.” It is the full moon closest to the northern autumnal equinox.
Long ago, before electric lights, farmers relied on the Harvest Moon to
light up their fields at night, allowing them to harvest autumn crops
even after sunset.
The Harvest Moon of 2006 is a big one–almost 12% wider than some full
Moons we’ve seen earlier this year. Why? Because the Moon is near
perigee, the side of the Moon’s lopsided orbit that comes closest to
Earth.
When the Harvest Moon rises tonight, go outside and ...

                    I remember I was complaining a while ago that September was going to be a brutal month, and that I’d be glad when it was all over.. I hardly even realized we were into October until today (shows how little attention I pay to dates), but I guess that means I’m in the clear. This is a pretty relaxed month in terms of things going on for me (which is a nice change), but November more than makes up for it (a stag, a wedding reception, and a trip to Mexico are the highlights next month).

The climax of this month will undoubtedly be Halloween. There are some bets floating around work, and for sure ...

                    After watching Clay kick some ass at the Marine Club the other night, I decided to go home and wipe the dust off of my guitars and play a bit.. It’s funny — I used to play all the time, but for some reason I rarely pick them up anymore.. I think part of the reason is that I just don’t like either of my guitars. My acoustic was just a cheap piece of garbage I picked up in Chilliwack when I was about 20 years old (it’s not bad to take camping, since you really don’t care what happens to it), and my electric needs some TLC in the electronics that I just don’t have time for (it has developed ...

                    For the last few months, I’ve been telling everyone just how wicked the TV show “24” was. I got hooked a few months ago on the show at Jason’s recommendation, and spent about two weeks straight on the couch watching episode after episode until I finished all four seasons. I’m eagerly waiting for season 5 to come out on DVD so I can kiss another full weekend goodbye watching it.
When my dad was in the hospital, Cathy rented the first four episodes of season one for him. I tried to talk to him online tonight and he was like “sorry, gotta go, episode 13 just started.” That’s 13 episodes ...

                    I read this link tonight, and it reminded me of my friend Jeff’s cousin who died while running from the police in California (not sure why he ran, but the police didn’t really seem to care — they just shot him a few times and he stopped running). Now the guy in this article I just read *was suspected* of killing a cop, but seriously: did they really need to shoot him 68 times?
Here’s a great quote:
“I suspect the only reason 110 rounds was all that was fired was that’s all the ammunition they had,” Judd said. “We were not going to take any chance of him shooting back.”

And let me tell you — what a refreshing sleep. I sometimes forget just how comfy my couch really is. I woke up at like noon, with the sounds of birds chirping and the fresh air blowing through my apartment (ok, maybe no birds were chirping, but you get the idea). I decided that it was a really good day to go for a walk, and what better destination than to head to Kits to see Dustin and Dori.
I grabbed my iPod and my camera and walked down to the little ferry to ...

                    Wow, I just woke up. Not a very exciting day, but it’s nice to have a good rest. I got up earlier and went for a walk, stopped by the plant shop, and headed home to see what was on TV. I was pleasantly surprised that Garden State was on, so I watched that (I saw it about 6 months ago, and really liked it — although Natalie Portman was a bit stiff as always). Several things stuck out this time:

Natalie Portman isn’t a very good actress (IMO)
Zach Braff directed the movie (I didn’t know that the first time around)
He also looks a lot like John Ritter did when he was younger
The soundtrack ...

                    Today is hopefully the day that my dad gets to go home from the ICU in Chilliwack. He went into New West. yesterday for angioplasty, and the initial word is that the surgery was a complete success. He’s got another 50 years of camping with the current hardware now. I spoke to him last night in the hospital via phone and he’s relieved and obviously happy to be going home. ...

                    Well, the time has come for me to give up caffeine once again. Why you might ask? Because I’m way too addicted to it, and I know how completely shitty it is for the body. Here are some reasons why caffeine sucks:

It disrupts REM sleep, making you feel tired in the morning
It increases cortisol, making you feel stressed out
It distrupts the body’s glucose system, increasing insulin levels by as much as 50%
It makes weight loss difficult since the body can’t burn fat with high levels of insulin in the blood

The problem with working in a high tech industry is that there’s free pop. So, ...

                    Why is it that hairdressers just can’t follow simple instructions? How does “just a little off the top” translate into “shave my head bald?” I just don’t get it. I’ve been trying to grow my hair a bit longer for like six months now, and yet whenever I go in to clean the sides up a bit, they always chop like a full inch off the top, even though they always promise not to.
It doesn’t start that way either, which is what I don’t get. The hairdresser always says “yeah, don’t worry, I’ll just take a quarter inch off the top to clean up your ends.” And then, it all just goes ...
