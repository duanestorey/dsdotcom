                    <p>As everyone knows, Rogers announced their lackluster iPhone plans not that long ago, and were immediately criticized by most Canadian wireless customers as being far too expensive. In addition, the lack of an unlimited data plan, a feature that Bell and Telus have for some of their phones, is also fairly disappointing give the web-based nature of the device.</p>
                    <p>In response to the data rates, <a href="http://www.ruinediphone.com/">RuinediPhone</a> set up an online petition asking Rogers to change their data rates. Since going live nearly a week ago, they’ve amassed nearly 36,000 signatures, and have been featured on several mainstream news segments.</p>
                    <p><a href="http://johnbiehler.com/2008/07/04/is-rogers-getting-the-message/">John Biehler</a> recently posted a great article on how Rogers may actually be starting to listen to these various complaints. The main wireless provider in Sweden also <a href="http://www.ipodnn.com/articles/08/07/03/telia.reworks.iphone.plans/">recently revised their iPhone data plans</a> to include an unlimited data option, mostly to appease customer complaints. I actually don’t think Rogers will do something similar based on their history, but I’m obviously hoping they do.</p>
                    <p>So, where does all this leave me? The thing is, I really don’t want to pay $100 a month for 3 years, even as much as I want the iPhone. Had it come with an unlimited data plan, I might have considered it. Given that most of the plans leave much to be desired, that there’s no unlimited data plan, and that Rogers requires a 3 year contract (something I told myself I’d never sign again), I really have no choice but to vote with my wallet. If you want to protest Roger’s iPhone plans, I suggest you do the same.</p>
                    <p>The other day I walked into a wireless store and picked up a cheap Solo phone with no contract. It’s no iPhone, but it’ll cost me about $40/mo, and should be all that I need. I would love nothing more than to be able to huck it in the garbage in July and pick up the 3G iPhone, but for that to happen Rogers will need to make a few changes to their plans. Given their history of gauging customers, I’m not so certain that they will, at least not unless they have fairly disappointing sales figures in July. So we’ll see.</p>
                    <p>Like I said above, if you are against Roger’s pricing and policies regarding the 3G iPhone, then the best thing you can do is not walk into a store next week and buy one.</p>
                    <p>If you have made a decision regarding the iPhone, I’d love to hear it here.</p>
