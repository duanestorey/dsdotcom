So tonight [John](http://www.audihertz.net/blog) and [Rebecca](http://www.miss604.com) stopped by for some moral support, and we spent the night hanging out, eating BBQ food, watching Trailer Park Boys, listening to music, and of course, having some drinks. It was a really awesome night, and I laughed enough that my face really, really hurts now. I'm definitely chewing two T3's before bed.

I'll be spending the rest of the weekend close to home, watching movies and hopefully relaxing.
