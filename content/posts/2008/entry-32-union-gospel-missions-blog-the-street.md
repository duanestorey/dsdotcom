As you well know by now, I am supporting the Union Gospel Mission for Blogathon. The Union Gospel Mission provides assistance to the homeless people in Vancouver, and those who are in the most need. At last count, this blog has raised at least $320 or so towards the charity, and I'm hoping to bring it closer to $1000 as the event continues. As I mentioned in my last two posts, anyone that donates at least $50 to the United Gospel Mission will receive a free 8x12 print from my HDR gallery. It can be a permanent reminder for you of the contribution you made to help some of the less fortunate in Vancouver.

For those of you that are interested in some of the things going on within Union Gospel Mission, I encourage you to check out their blog called [The Street](http://www.ugm.ca/blog/).

They recently posted a blog entry [regarding Blogathon](http://www.ugm.ca/blog/UGM1_07250801.aspx) and the hard work Rebecca has put into pulling it off. Given that The Street ultimately represents a forum where Union Gospel Mission can potentially share stories of some of the real-life impact of their efforts, I think it's an amazing thing to have and to share with others.

This entry was written for [Blogathon 2008](http://www.migratorynerd.com/tag/blogathon), and in support of the [Union Gospel Mission](http://ugm.ca) charity.
