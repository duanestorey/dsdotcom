Last couple days have been a bit busy for me. Started a new project at work which is fairly interesting, and have spent a lot of time catching up in that area. Rest of the week should be about the same. I've been meaning to head down to the lab to get another run of tests to see where I stand with all the health garbage I was dealing with. Maybe on Friday.

This weekend there are two birthdays going on, Kasia and Rebecca, which should be a lot of fun. Rebecca is just about to breach "cougar territory" and I'm glad I get to be around to see the start of the transition.
