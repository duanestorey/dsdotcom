It appears that things are almost back to normal with regards to my blog. I had to juggle the DNS entries around a bit the other day, and that caused a period of time where both versions of my blog existed on the internet for a while. I think for the most part most people will be directed to this one, which is the way it should be.

I went out last night to a roof top patio BBQ, courtesy of [Invoke Media](http://www.invokemedia.com/). I went along with [Arieanna](http://www.blogaholics.ca), [Raul](http://hummingbird604.com) and Ianiv, and eventually we met up with [Jenn](http://www.lowtherrinserepeat.com/) for some good conversation. Invoke has a pretty cool office, complete with a nice view of the North Shore mountains.

Afterwards, we all headed over to [Tanya's new condo](http://netchick.ca) for some rock band. I arrived just in time to see [Raul](http://hummingbird604.com) bust a beer bottle all over the floor, which happens to the best of us from time to time. I rocked the singing part of rock band by singing in the ever popular key of Duane-minor all night. Good times.

I actually was pretty beat last night, so I ended up bailing early and coming home. I don't really have any plans for today, except for the ever-lingering desire to hit up a theatre and watch the Dark Knight. Arieanna and Ianiv and I might hit it later tonight. I also might try and hit the Apple store to drop my laptop off, although given that I might be heading to Serbia for a month, I'm not sure I can handle them taking my laptop off my hands right now.
