It seems that after eight years of university I've acquired a fairy large array of engineering books. Since I haven't read any of them in years, I figure I might as well sell a few of them off. Here's a list of some of them. If you're interested, drop me a comment. Also, please feel free to forward this list on to any physics or electrical engineering students.

- Materials Science and Engineering, William D. Callister
- Digital Signal Processing, Emmanuel C. Ifeachor
- Introduction to Electrodymanics, Griffiths
- Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Griffiths
- Microprocessor Systems Design, Clements
- Computer Networks, Andrew Tanenbaum
- Modern Control Systems, Dorf & Bishop
- Digital Image Processing, Gonzalez & woods
- Fluid Mechanics, White - **SOLD**
- Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems, Boyce and DiPrima
- Optics, Hecht
- Microelectronic Circuits, Sedra and Smith
- Contemporary Logic Design, Katz
- Micro-Optics, Elements, Systems and Applications, Herzig
