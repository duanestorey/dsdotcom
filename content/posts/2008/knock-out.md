I haven't been sleeping well at all this week, and on Monday night only got about three hours of sleep. So last night I picked up some Sleep-Aid from the pharmacy on my way home from work. I was originally going to force myself to stay up until 11pm before hitting the sack, but actually passed out on the couch at around 7:30pm and woke up around 10:30pm. I did a bit of work on the computer until 11:30pm, then popped a Sleep Aid for the win.

I woke up at around 6:30am this morning feeling rather good actually. It's nice to have a full sleep for a change.

This weekend is easter (I think), and I'm heading home to spend some time with the family. My nephew's birthday is on Saturday, so I'm going to stroll by and hang out with him for a while. Sounds like most people at work are taking Monday off and making it a four day weekend, so I'll probably fill out the paperwork today and do the same.
