Yesterday morning I found myself in Pacific Center mall doing a bit of shopping for Brennen's daughter, Kaede. I ended up getting her this pretty cool Canucks shirt (thanks to Beth for the idea):

I ran into Ianiv in the mall, and we ended up chatting for a bit. One of the things I've been debating for quite some time now is moving out of the downtown core. My first choice is somewhere on the North Shore, hopefully fairly close to the Seabus (since I work downtown). Whenever I'm out that way, it just seems more community oriented, and easier to get around than downtown. My second choice is the West End, but I was reading that vacancy rates in the West End are less than 1%, so it's probably harder to find a decent priced place there.

So, if anyone has a line on anything in the next few months that goes for less than $1200/month, please let me know. As long as it's relatively clean and quiet, it'll probably be fine.
