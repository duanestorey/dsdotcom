Since it's rather apparent that our blogalicious friend, Duane, has such a deep love for the spirit of all things Christmas (and in particular the Christmas tree), I thought I'd share a few fun facts about Christmas trees I managed to dig up online.

Notice That My Christmas Tree Is Still Up In The Background

- Most parts of pine, spruce and fir trees can be _eaten_! In fact, they're a great source of vitamin C, which will come in great for that Christmastime cold...

- Christmas trees date back to the mid-1500s, with some of the first decorations being apples. The apple was representative of the pitfall of Adam and Eve

- In many cultures it's considered bad luck to put your Christmas tree up before December 1. Either this is untrue, or Duane's safe on account of the fact that, well, his tree is up 365 days a year.

- The first retail Christmas trees were sold in North America in New York City in 1851. Come to think of it, I think this is where Duane's came from.

- One square acre of planted Christmas trees provides enough oxygen for one day for 18 people.

- In [1-6 days](http://www.premiumchristmastree.com/), you too can be just like Duane.

As much as I hassle him about the tree in July, it's really rather charming. The truth is, Christmas is my favourite time of year; Christmas is Duane's favourite time all year...
