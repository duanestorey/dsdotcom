Can anyone recommend a good accountant to me for doing personal taxes? I've typically always done them myself, but due to the odd web and photography gig I've had over the last year, they are starting to get a bit complicated in terms of write-offs etc.

If you can let me know, that would be great. Preferably someone close to the downtown core.
