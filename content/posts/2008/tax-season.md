For those that are interested, I finally found an account downtown that I think is willing to do my taxes. I've typically always done them myself, except for one year when I had a bunch of stock and moving expenses I wasn't sure how to deal with. I have income from multiple sources this year (thanks to photography and the odd web job), which should mean (in theory) that I'm eligible to write off some of my photography and computer expenses.

Unfortunately, I'm not the most organized person in the world, and I somehow have to track down all my tax stuff from last year, along with everything from this year, prior to my Wednesday meeting with the accountant. So tomorrow night is undoubtedly going to be fairly crazy.
