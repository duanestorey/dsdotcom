I'm currently at the internet cafe on Davie street killing some time waiting for a Dr's appointment next door. I've been waiting for some test results from that whole stupid bacterial infection thing I got in the hospital last year. Not really sure what's going to happen there.

Tonight I'm also the official photographer for the Facebook Developer Meetup down at the Vancouver Film School. [Rebecca (aka Miss604)](http://miss604.com) will be down there doing the official live-blog, so make sure you check it out if you want to follow remotely.

I'm looking forward to taking it easy next weekend. One of the things I'm historically not very good at is saying no to people. Lately I've been involved in so many things that I'm starting to feel spread a little thin. I'm not sure what I'll end up doing next weekend, but I'm probably going to turn my cell phone off and maybe get out of town. I'd love to go camping, but it's still a bit cold, and getting ready for camping is a lot of work. So I'll probably find something else to do.

Check Rebecca's blog later for some of the photos from the event.
