I rarely dream, or remember them at least. Last night however, I had one of the best nights of dreaming in a long time. Most of them were a bit messed up, and a few of them were of the past. I woke up at around 5am this morning actually feeling like it was about ten years ago based on some dreams I was having. That's a strange feeling.

Then, at 6am, the fire alarm went off, so I spent the first few minutes trying to find something to wear downstairs, and then evetually stumbled down 15 flights of stairs in some jeans, I think. Thankfully the cute girl from 14 was there too in her jammies, so I got to hang out with her for a while and chat.

In other exciting news, I somehow lost my bank card on the trip home, probably on the plane. So, I'm currently without access to money. I might have to take a run out to Superstore tonight and get a new PC Financial card, otherwise I'm going to start starving soon.

Back at work now. A bit tired, but looking forward to another year.
