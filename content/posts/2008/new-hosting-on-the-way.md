As some of you know, last year I went from having my blog hosted on GoDaddy to using shared hosting services over at HostMonster (and before that, I went from having a Linux box on the floor of my bedroom to GoDaddy). Shared hosting is a fairly cheap way to set up a website, and you can usually get away with it for less than $10/mo. For the most part, I was pretty happy with [HostMonster shared hosting](http://hostmonster.com), although in these last few months their databases kept falling over, and I had intermittent connection problems. To their credit though, they always answered the phone and fixed everything in a timely manner.

That being said, I'm going to try someone new this time. I asked a few people who they use, and a couple people recommended the next step which is shared computing on a grid computer. The concept seems pretty cool. Instead of having one system where your website is allocated on, you actually run on a large cluster. If you suddenly get Dugg or tons of traffic, you automatically scale to accommodate the new traffic. I'm not really worried about falling down due to traffic, but since I host multiple websites on my accounts, I'd like to have a bit more peace of mind when it comes to them staying online.

Last night I signed up for an account at [Media Temple](http://www.mediatemple.net/). I'll probably attempt to move my main domain over tomorrow sometime and some of my other smaller sites over the next few days. There may be some temporary drop outs as things move over, but I'm fairly certain I can make it transparent.

Also, if you sign up on Media Temple, feel free to use my domain name (duanestorey.com) as the referral site -- much appreciated!
