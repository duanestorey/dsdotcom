So, this in this day and age this is probably a rhetorical post. I imagine most guys wear boxer shorts these days, and I typically do as well. That being said, I couldn't find any that were clean this morning so I was forced to put on a pair of briefs that were hiding in my closet.

Surprisingly, they are far comfier than I remembered. It sort of feels like I've just reunited with an old childhood friend. Even though that friend is going to go away as soon as the laundry machine spins back up, it's bound to be a good visit.
