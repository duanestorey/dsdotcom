Tuesday evening, Toronto blogger and artist [Raymi](http://raymitheminx.com) (Lauren White) will be down at the [Crooked Star](http://www.torontolife.com/guide/bars-and-clubs/bars/crooked-star/) showing off some of her art and meeting people. If you're in the Toronto area, make sure you pop by with lots of money. The event kicks off at 7pm, and looks like it will go into the wee hours of the morning.
