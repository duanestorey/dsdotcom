I'm sitting here with John and Rebecca waiting for the Northern Voice keynote to begin. This year it's Wordpress' own Matt Mullenweg, who will be talking about blogging and Wordpress 2.5.

Keynote is over. It was really entertaining and enlightening, and I thought some of the points about advertising overload with sites like Facebook were interesting.
