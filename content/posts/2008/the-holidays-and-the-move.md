On Monday I made the trek to Chilliwack out from Vancouver. The timing was actually perfect, since the roads were fairly bare when I left Vancouver, and are now pretty clogged up with snow. It's been snowing off and on here in Chilliwack, but at least driving around is feasible. The forecast is currently calling for rain for the next few days, followed by more snow probably on Monday. That basically means I'll be making the journey back into Vancouver sometime this weekend, hopefully before the next wave of God's winter-fury hit's British Columbia.

So far, it's been a very relaxing time out at home. I've been bouncing between my dad's house and my sister's house, and have had a chance to visit most family members so far, which is great. I have to say though, it's a bit strange being out here knowing that in just a few weeks I'm going to be a local again.

My family doesn't really do the whole present exchange thing in any capacity any more, so I don't really end up with much at Christmas time. That being said though, I did get a new duvet cover for my bed (which is great since I'm going to buy new sheets and pillows after the move as well), some gift cards, and a bunch of towels and bath accessories from my mom, which will hopefully help make my new place a bit more homely.

My official moving date is on January 18th, and I've already reserved a U-Haul for the purpose. I still haven't decided how I'm going to do the actual deed, or how I'm going to get my car out to Chilliwack, but I guess I'll figure it out as it gets closer to the date. I have next week off, and then it's back to work for me on the 5th. As of January 16th, I'll be self-employed, and then it's onward to Chilliwack on the 18th. I'll probably hit a pub one night before then and try to meet up with as many people as possible for a few drinks.
