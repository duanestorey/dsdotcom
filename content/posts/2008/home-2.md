Well, I'm back home.. Currently I'm lying on a bed in the spare room at my dad's house. Last night I hung out with my grandma and my mom, and then ended up drinking and playing pool at my uncle's. Unfortunately, I drank a wee-bit too much, and woke up with a splitting headache today.

I think I'm going to take a nap and then hopefully be rested up enough again to do a bit of web work. On another note, the alarm on my car has started going off for apparently no reason. I almost had to disconnect the battery the other night because I couldn't figure out how to turn it off. Turns out you have to stick the key in the driver's-side door and turn it.
