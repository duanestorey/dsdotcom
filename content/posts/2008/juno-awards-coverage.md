On Friday morning I'll be flying out to the Juno awards in Calgary. There's a press conference at noon sharp where the media will get to view the entire setup as well as talk to Russell Peters, the host of the Juno Awards. I was originally going to fly out around noon, but I just got the email about the press conference so I might take the full day off and fly out at 7am, assuming I can change my flight.

I'm still waiting on a few image assets from the Juno organization, but I've started putting together a page that I'll use when I'm out there. If you can, please throw some link love at my [2008 Canadian Juno Awards Coverage](http://www.migratorynerd.com/2008-juno-awards/) page so that people can find it, and I don't feel like an idiot writing entirely for myself.

I'll probably promote it to the front page (something I've never done in Wordpress before, although the option exists) during the event, but I'm hoping to flesh out my page with a few cool surprises before I get on the plane.

I'll also be doing the odd post over at [Urban Vancouver](http://urbanvancouver.com), and probably a guest post over at [Miss604.com](http://miss604.com). [John Bollwitt](http://johnbollwitt.com) is also going to lend me his iPod podcasting setup, so hopefully there will be an interview or two, should the opportunity arise.
