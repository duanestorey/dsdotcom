As you can see, my little advertising experiment with Commission Junction is pretty failtastic.

Which is strange, because the ads are fairly targeted based on a few specific, popular pages of mine. I'm not a big fan of advertising to tell you the truth -- I ripped Google Adsense off here a few months ago. To me, it's worth $10 a month or whatever not to have them pollute my main page. I was testing a new concept though with more targeted ads that I choose, but so far it's not working.

Is anyone here actually making money with your blog (i.e, enough at least to pay for hosting)?
