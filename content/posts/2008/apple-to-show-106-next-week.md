I've seen a few rumour sites suggest that Apple is preparing to seed developers with an early 10.6 release of their operating system. You can [read about it here.](http://www.tuaw.com/2008/06/03/rumor-mac-os-x-10-6-to-debut-at-wwdc-08/) If true, it sounds like it's more of a maintenance/stability release, which makes me really wonder why they would name it a 10.6 instead of a 10.5.4. And to be honest, I'd be really disappointed if they were to release 10.6 as a real, full fledged (i.e. you have to pay more money) update to the operating system, considering Leopard isn't that old and that it's far from stable as it is.

It's obviously just a rumour, so I'm not going to worry too much about it, but I'm starting to question some of Apple's business practices of late.
