Wordpress 2.5.1 came out today. Wordpress 2.5 was actually a bit buggy (IMO), so I'm happy to incorporate this new release. I was for some reason still running a 2.6 beta version, and now I'm officially back on the stable line. If you're a Wordpress user, you might want to download it and install it -- apparently it has a few rather important security releases.
