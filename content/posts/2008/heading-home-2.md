Wow, it feels like I've been disconnected from the Internet for a very long time. I spent today somewhere between Los Angeles and San Diego, hanging out at Legoland with my family. I actually wasn't really sure what to expect, given that I haven't really been into lego in a long time. But the good news is that Legoland was a lot of fun, and it was a nice change from the line-ups and the pace of Disneyland. Also, Legoland was near the water, and was a nice change from the hot weather down in Anaheim.

My nephew Derek spent about $150 on Lego in Legoland, and it was the happiest I've seen the little guy in a long time. Since he was having so much fun buying Lego, I thought hey, I might as well buy some too. I had my heart set on some Star Wars lego, but one of the workers said they were down to the last couple boxes of the limited edition Indiana Jones lego, after which they wouldn't be making any more. So based on that, I picked up a $50 set of Indiana Jones Lego. I'm actually looking forward to curling up with a movie one night and putting it together back in Vancouver.

I said goodbye to the family tonight, and made the drive back to Los Angeles airport. The first order of business was to drop off the rental car, which was rather uneventful. After that I took a quick cab and ended up down at the Sheraton Gateway hotel, my home for the evening. I have an early morning flight back to Vancouver, and get in shortly before noon. Even though I had a pile of fun down here with the kids and my family, I'm looking forward to heading back home and away from this 39C heat wave they've had down here.

I officially start my two weeks of vacation tomorrow, which means I have a pile of time ahead of me to do stuff. I really haven't given much thought to what I'm going to do, but I'm sure I'll sort it out in the next few days. Matt's show in on Thursday, so I have to stick around for that, but I'm about 90% certain I'm going to leave Friday morning and disappear into the mountains somewhere with my tent.

Right now, I'm going to curl up in bed with my laptop and a movie. Next stop, Vancouver.
