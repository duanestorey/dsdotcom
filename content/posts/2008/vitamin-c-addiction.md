Yes, it's true. I'm officially addicted to vitamin C. I'm not sure how it happened really. I started taking vitamins recently to go along with my diet. Since the store had these fun sugar-free grape ones I thought, hey, what the hell. Turns out, they are like the best tasting things ever.

They recommend two per day, but I'm sure I had at least twenty over the course of the day today. It's basically impossible to OD on vitamin C, so I'm not worried at all. Unfortunately though, the sweetening ingredient in these little bad boys is sorbitol, which is a type of sugar alcohol. Sugar alcohols taste good and don't metabolize like sugar, but unfortunately lead to some pretty major gastro-intestinal distress.

If you see me dash out of PhotoCamp on Friday in a hurry, it's nothing personal. It just means I stocked up on vitamins in the morning.
