A big thanks to the following people who recently pledged support for the Union Gospel Mission

Wow. To say I am completely exhausted at this point would be an understatement. I've essentially been awake since yesterday at 9am. That means I've been awake for around 30 hours now. Blogathon ends for me at 10pm tonight, which means I still have nearly eight hours left to go. I'm really not entirely sure how I'm going to make it, but hopefully I get my third or fourth wind soon.

This Is Me When I'm Tired

I've been listening to music rather loudly in my living room, hoping the aural stimulation will somehow keep me awake. Despite pounding back a full 2-litre of diet pepsi today, a coffee, and two energy drinks, I feel like I could just close my eyes and not wake up until tomorrow. I somehow managed to figure out how to pair my new iPhone with my Apple TV, and now I can control the music on my stereo simply by pressing buttons on my iPhone -- pretty slick.

I won't know what the total is for this website until Rebecca lands in Vancouver, which should be shortly. I suspect it's around $350 now, and I want to thank everyone who has contributed so far. Your donations will undoubtedly help some of the homeless in Vancouver, either by helping them secure shelter, or possibly by giving them a warm meal from time to time.

I have a host of articles that I could potentially write about, but I'm really not sure what people are interesting in at this point. Please drop a comment if there's any thing you'd like to know more about, and I'll do some due diligence and try to do a comprehensive post about it.

Thanks.
