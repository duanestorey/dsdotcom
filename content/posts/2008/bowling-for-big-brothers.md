Rebecca fired me off a link this morning asking if I'd like to be a part of Team Blogging for a big bowling charity fundraiser. Since I like bowling and I like blogging, I figured it would be a cool idea.

You can read more about the details [over on Rebecca's blog](http://www.miss604.com/2008/02/bowl-for-big-brothers-classic-blog-and-bowl-with-us.html). I'm trying to raise $150 to go towards the event, so if you can help out by sponsoring me, I would really appreciate it.
