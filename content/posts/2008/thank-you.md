I've been lying in bed for about 20 minutes now, trying to slow my brain down enough so that I can finally catch up on sleep. Unfortunately, my mind has been racing ever since blogathon, and it's been rather difficult to shut it off.

While in bed tonight, I started thinking about the day I had today, the people I spent it with, and the events of this past weekend. Like a hiker nearing the end of a long trek, I forced myself to stop and survey the trail from which I've come; the moments of exhaustion, the long rainy nights, the hills and the valleys, and the painful blisters that may never fully heal. And while the road has been long, it has been a journey filled with sunsets and sunrises, the scent of fresh mountain air, and nighttime skies where the stars go on forever.

The last two years of my life were incredibly challenging. And yet, despite the many bumps in the road, I have thankfully managed to endure, and to grow. And for that, I owe a great deal to this blog and to many of the wonderful people I have met as a result of it.

This weekend, with all of your help, [Rebecca and I](http://miss604.com) raised well over $2000 that will ultimately help the [Union Gospel Mission](http://ugm.ca) and the homeless in Vancouver. It is a number, I feel, that is rather impressive, given that it was acquired from the comfort of our own homes, and from the pledges of all of you.

Over the last few years this blog has become a rather large part of my life. Not just for the content and the outlet that it provides, but most importantly, for all of you - the discussions we've had, the contacts I've made, and most importantly, the many friendships that have come as a result of it.

And for all of that, I thank each and everyone of you.
