You know, it's hard to believe that there was a time when Andie was actually taller than me, but it's true. I think I passed him at the age of 16 or so, but Andie could always hold his own in a wrestling match.

As you can tell, today is my brother-in-law, Andie's, birthday. Andie started dating my sister when I was 14 or 15, and he's been an integral part of the family ever since. I'm proud to call him my brother-in-law.

Happy Birthday Bud.
