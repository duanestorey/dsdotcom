Wow, that seems like a title from 24. Anyways, Ryland Haggis was by tonight for a few beers, which was definitely cool, since we've been talking about it for a while now. For those of you who don't know Ryland, he's an extremely talented photographer who also happens to be an amazing bass player -- he's currently in [Jessie Farrell](http://www.jessiefarrell.com)'s band, and has been touring with her this last year.

If you haven't heard of him, go [add him on Twitter](http://twitter.com/rylandh), or also check out his [professional musician website](http://www.rylandhaggis.com).

Also, make sure to check out [Jessie's website](http://www.jessiefarrell.com) -- Jessie's currently down in Nashville writing some of her next album.
