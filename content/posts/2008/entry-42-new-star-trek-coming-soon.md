I've a die hard Star Trek fan -- always have been, and always will be. My dad and I used to sit around every Sunday watching Star Trek The Next Generation in the old days, and I've fairly certain I've seen every episode of the original series. That's why I'm looking forward to the new Star Trek movie coming out, which is essentially an origin story.

Even though the trailer doesn't really show anything, I'm fairly certain it's going to be awesome!
