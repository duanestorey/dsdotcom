I have to ask -- what is it with everyone's obsession to feed each other stuff that's really bad for you? Every day at work is a constant battle of having to tell people you don't want cookies, or chocolate, or donuts. It seems like everywhere I go someone is trying to ram a cookie down my throat.

I like sweets as much as the next guy, but I'm not sure where this fad came from. I really hate having to tell someone "no" ten times. It's fun for the first two, and then it's just super annoying. As someone who has basically had to watch my weight my entire life, I really get upset when people hammer me for 10 minutes straight about some goodies that I clearly don't want.

Ok, I'm done ranting, and no I don't want any cookies, thanks.
