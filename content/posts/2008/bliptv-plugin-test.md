So I'm pretty stoked on blip.tv. Here's a short video from my patio that I uploaded. The conversion was done is less than 60 seconds. Plus, using my blip.tv plugin, this video should render properly on the iPhone or iPod Touch as well (so try it if you have one).

Here's the video I shot the other day:

\[blipit id=789757\]

And another one I just converted:

\[blipit id=795411\]
