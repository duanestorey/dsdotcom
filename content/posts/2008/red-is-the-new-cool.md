I started playing with a new look and feel for my blog last week, and finished most of it off tonight. I had hacked my other one quite a few times and ended up breaking a few things on it. Hopefully this one will stay lean and mean a little while longer.

I still have to fix up the content on many of the subpages, but the main pages should be working mostly. I'm also going to be modifying the content to reflect my move out to Chilliwack in a few weeks, and of course going full time with [BraveNewCode](http://www.bravenewcode.com).

I have a few more ideas with regards to showing images and what not, but this is a pretty good start I think.
