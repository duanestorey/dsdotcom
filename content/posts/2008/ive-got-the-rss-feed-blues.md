I woke up this morning and had a few people email me saying that there were a bunch of duplicate entries in my RSS feed. I really have no idea why, but since I installed WordPress 2.7 RC1 last night, I suspect that it's related to that. I might spend a bit of time trying to figure out why. More likely is that I do nothing though and simply let it work itself out naturally. I'll scan the WordPress forums in a few minutes and see if anyone else is having this issue, otherwise I'll spend a bit of time debugging.

Thanks to everyone who emailed me to let me know that my website sucked. Much appreciated.
