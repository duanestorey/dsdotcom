[Rebecca](http://miss604.com) has come up with a pretty cool idea with regards to web awards locally. She's set up [BestOf604.com](http://bestof604.com/) where people can currently nominate websites for various categories. Afterwards people will be able to vote on who they think deserves to win. Sometime in the near future there will be an awards ceremony.

Make sure your head on over and check it out.
