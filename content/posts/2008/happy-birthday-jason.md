Today is Jason's 40th birthday. Jason's a good friend of mine currently living down in the San Francisco area. I used to be really bad at remembering birthdays, but now Facebook is pretty decent at reminding me.

Have a good birthday, dude. Don't drink too much -- at your age I'm not sure your liver can handle it.
