After playing with my photos this evening, I decided it was about time I put together my official media kit. As most people know, I've been fortunate enough to cover a lot of great events in the last year or so. Thankfully, it's a trend that seems to be continuing. With that in mind, I slapped together the first little bit of my [Media Kit](http://www.migratorynerd.com/media-kit) tonight. I also integrated the jQuery image gallery, which is pretty slick if you ask me.

I still have quite a bit to add, but it's slowly shaping up. If anyone sees anything I missed, please let me know.

Also, looks like [Martina Franko](http://www.martinafranko.com/) (the olympic soccer player I did a photoshoot for last year) has a blog up, and she's covering the team's events in China right now. So head on over and take a look!
