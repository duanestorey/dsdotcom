I woke up to my phone ringing basically non-stop thanks to Hesty and Sean at work. There's a big career fair out at UBC today, and I guess they are all going and wanted me to go too. I woke up with a nasty sore throat though, so I'm going to leave the recruiting to those guys.

I'm going to pass around a bit of link-juice this morning. First, we have [Rebecca](http://miss604.com) and [Keira](http://keira-anne.com), who are packing up and heading to the island for some licking and snowboarding.

That means [John](http://audiohertz.net/blog) is currently wifeless, so I think him and I are going to figure out something fun to do this weekend. Judging by the weather, I'm guessing we'll be watching movies and nerding out on the laptops for some of it. If anyone is around and into nerd sessions, drop me a nerdmail. I'm pretty sure whatever we end up doing will involve computers, beer, and a plastic chicken.

[John Biehler](http://johnbiehler.com) just twittered some of the first Apple Air laptop photos from some guy unpacking his. I like how they tapered the edges to make it seem a lot thinner than it is. That Steve Jobs, he's a smart cookie. Of course, nobody is quoting how thick it is in the middle. Everyone is focused on how thin it is at the outer edges, something that's obviously important should you ever try to dock it with a piece of paper.

You can take [a look at the rest of the photos](http://uneasysilence.com/archive/2008/01/12919/) over there.

Also, I'm somehow started using twitter again, so if you're on there, you can [check me out at duanestorey](http://twitter.com/duanestorey). I have to get some food into me before I dissolve like the witch in the Wizard of Oz, but I'll be back shortly and will probably post something else mildly more exciting in a bit.

Also, two out of three of these are my new motto in life. Can you guess which two?

Ok really, I have to eat. I'm going to get a muffin from downstairs. They are so good, and yet so bad.
