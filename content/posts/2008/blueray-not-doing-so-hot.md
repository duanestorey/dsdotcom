This isn't really a huge surprise to me, but apparently BlueRay sales aren't doing very well at all. In fact, [sales of BlueRay went down last month](http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/007792.html) compared to the month before.

There are probably a lot of reasons why other people aren't buying them, namely the high price of current BlueRay players. But in terms of me, I'm not buying one simply because I'm still pissed off from the whole HD-DVD/BlueRay battle. On my shelf at home is a now useless HD-DVD player, which I purchased thinking HD-DVD would be around a little while longer. Since the industry basically screwed consumers with that whole debacle, I'm fighting back a bit with my wallet.

Sony hoped to have a 50% market share this year, and right now they are sitting around 8% I think. Given that internet speeds are climbing fast, and that Apple TV now rents pseudo HD films, I'm not really sure the BlueRay HD market is ever going to take off.
