I set up a Linux box at home a while ago, mainly so that I'd have a stable place to run my blog. To that end, I installed Centos on it, which is an enterprise grade version of Linux (many hosting companies use it).

The one downside to using Centos is that most of the packages in the repositories are rather old (although they are usually stable). So if you want to stay on the cutting edge, it's fairly hard using this distribution.

While trying to install PHP 5.2 tonight, I stumbled upon a [a really great up-to-date Centos repository](http://www.jasonlitka.com/yum-repository/). Thankfully it has prebuilt PHP and MYSQL versions.
