Here's a recent form letter I got from Lingo:

> Dear {RECIPIENT\_NAME}, When promoting Lingo, please understand there should be no outbound calls made for any reason. If it is found outbound calls are being made, you will be kicked out of the program and legal action will also be taken. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email. Thank you, The Lingo Affiliate Team

For future reference, if you're going to mass email all your subscribers, you might want to make sure the code behind it all does the right thing.
