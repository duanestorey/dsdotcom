It's slow, but the sun is slowly going down out here in Vancouver, which means we're not only past the half-way point, but it'll soon be dark. I imagine it'll be a lot harder to stay awake when it gets dark here, but who knows. Here's my current view in Vancouver:

I'm going to venture down to the Lamplighter in a bit and grab some beers. I probably won't crack any until the wee hours of the morning, mainly because my stomach feels like it's about to burst from all the food that's in it. But it would be nice to have a beer or two at the end of the night in celebration of a very long day.

In terms of donations, a big thank you goes out to everyone -- we're currently up to $1,145 for the BC Children's Hospital Foundation. I still have 12 hours to go, so if you're still looking to donate, you have lots of time. Thanks again to everyone who has read, commented, and donated.
