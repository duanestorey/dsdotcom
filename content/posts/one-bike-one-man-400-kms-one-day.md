A friend of mine at work, Rob Brown, is trying to raise both awareness and some money to support Cancer research here in Canada. I personally lost my grandfather to prostate cancer, and I think most people at some point or another have had someone close to them who has suffered with cancer as well.

Rob is part of a team that has taken it upon themselves to bike from Kelowna to Vancouver, a distance of roughly 400 kms (a route that goes through not one, but two large mountain passes), in one day to raise money for cancer research. If you wish to donate, please visit [this secure link](https://www.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=228634&lis=1&kntae228634=11939B6E368F4326AD5FF2CAB49D2A80&supId=124729243) to make a donation, or drop a comment or two here for support.

Good luck Rob.
