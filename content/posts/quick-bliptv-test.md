Good news is I'm fairly happy with the outcome, especially with the branding part of it. Plus transcoding only took about 3 or 4 minutes. I signed up for a Pro Account on a month by month basis for this upcoming weekend. It gives me priority transcoding and the ability to automatically generate iPod specific versions at the same time.

The only question left is weather to shoot at 320x240 or 640x480. If I were at home, I'd just shoot 640x480, but the files end up rather large, and if I'm limited to a crappy hotel connection, might prefer speed over quality. Plus, 320x240 is basically iPod/iPhone resolution, so the conversion is easier (it's going on 15 minutes trying to convert my 640x480 into an iPhone version). I'll have to think about this one some more.

Here's an embed link which should (in theory) bring up an iPhone media player. It seems to work awesome on my iPod Touch, so I imagine it will also work on the iPhone. Which means I may have to write a quick plugin to show the proper one if you're on the iPhone or not. Maybe I'll use the new short-code system in WP 2.5 to do it:
