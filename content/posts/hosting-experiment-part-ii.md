A while ago I did a quick and dirty hosting experiment with some of my readers. I actually need a bit more data, although what I'm after is a bit easier this time.

So, if you have a blog, all I ask is that you let me know the following:

- The URL for your blog
- The name of the hosting company that you're on
- If you like it or not

So please post a comment if you have some of that info, or send me an email if you don't really want it public. If you know of any friends and where they are at, let me know too. Thanks!
