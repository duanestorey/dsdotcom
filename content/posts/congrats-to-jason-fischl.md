My good friend Jason Fischl (who coincidentally used to be my old boss for while) [just joined the Skype team](http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2009/04/jason_fischl_joins_skype_as_di.html) down in the Bay Area as the Director of Developer Relations.

I think it's a great role, and I'm looking forward to seeing what Skype continues to do in the future now that Jason is involved. Congrats Jason.
