I realized I removed most of my contact information a while ago. I actually briefly had my phone number available on my Facebook page, and acquired two stalkers in the process last year, so I basically removed everything but my email. Thankfully that's passed, and I'm less timid now. So, if you're looking to get a hold of me, here are a few ways:

- You can try email on my contact page
- Check out [my facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=626915636)
- My [recently resurrected MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/duanestorey) (warning, may disappear without notice)
- My [Twitter page](http://twitter.com/duanestorey)
- My [Jaiku Page](http://duanestorey.jaiku.com/)
