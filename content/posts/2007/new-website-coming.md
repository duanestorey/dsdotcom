Hey guys.. I've been thinking about completely revamping this website for quite a long time. Unfortunately, every time I start it, I always get sidetracked and end up throwing away a lot of the changes that I've made before.

However, I'm going to make some pretty major changes to it soon. Which means, I'm probably gonna take the site down for a while, probably starting this weekend. I have some pretty big ideas about what I want to do, and I'm not even sure I have the skill set to do them all. Some of the things I want to do:

1) new theme for the look and feel that I want - it will probably be a dark background, even though most people seem to hate them 2) more ajax 3) photo-centric posts 4) better flickr/youtube integration 5) updated content 6) new hosting location (godaddy is sooooo slow)

I'm hoping to get alot of it done this weekend, but the reality is it may take me longer than that. I could leave the website up, but I think I'll be far more motivated to actually finish all these changes off if I take it down. Also, changing hosting locations can be a bit of a pain due to DNS changes etc, so it's probably better to just take it down and get it done.

So, I'm probably gonna find some pub or coffee shop this weekend with wireless access and see what I can come up with.
