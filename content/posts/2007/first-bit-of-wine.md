So, as promised, Sheila and I went out today and purchased a pile of wine down at the Alberni liquor store. Here's a list of what I picked up:

- 2004 Las Rocas (Spain)
- 2003 Altos de Luxon, Jumilla (Spain)
- 2003 Chateauneuf du Pape (France)
- 2005 Wits End, Cabernet Franc, The Procrastinator
- 2003 Renwood Zinfandel (California)
- 2003 Woodhenge Shiraz (Australia)
- [2000 Cote de Nuits "Le Vaucrain" (France)](http://www.wills-burgundy.com/lesvins/details.asp?item=106)
- 2005 Malbec, Achaval Ferrer (Argintina)
- [2004 Glen Carlou Syrah (South Africa)](http://www.spittoon.biz/glen_carlou_platters_wine_of_t.html)

Tomorrow I'm gonna head down to a place on 4th and figure out how to do this home brew stuff. I've been told that it tastes pretty good, and the price really can't be beat for the day to day stuff.
