If you love to eat, or are in desperate need of some new recipes, check out [FoodLikeThat.com](http://www.foodlikethat.com/). Dreamed up by internet guru [Boris Mann](http://www.bmannconsulting.com), here's a little low-down on what it's about:

> Food Like That is a new kind of recipe sharing site. It's designed to rank highly in Google. When people find your recipe, and click on the ads on your recipe page, we share the revenue with you.
> 
> But that's not really the cool part. The cool part is that it helps you find more food you like. Do you like dishes with eggs? You'll probably like quiche or maybe a frittata.

Check it out. I added my world famous nacho recipe there.
