As I mentioned yesterday, I have launched a photography website at [photography.duanestorey.com](http://photography.duanestorey.com). I'm going to give the first 20 people who link to it with a small write-up a free 8x12 of their choosing from the galleries. So, if you're interested, do a quick blog entry and then post a comment here. Send me an email with which one you want and where you want it sent to, and I'll take care of the rest.

Thanks everyone.

\*\* UPDATE - Thanks to everyone for linking. With the emails and comments here I've received, I'm pretty sure I have more than 20. So while I appreciate all incoming links should you choose to write about it, the original 20 photos are already allocated to people.

Thanks everyone!
