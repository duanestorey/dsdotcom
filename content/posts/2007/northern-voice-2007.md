[![](images/monte_badge.jpg)](http://www.northernvoice.ca)Northern Voice is a conference geared towards personal bloggers who want to get together and share good ideas. This is the third event of this nature in Canada, and it looks like it's going to be a great event. [Kasia](http://purplegables.wordpress.com) and I both signed up today to check out the conference and meet all the other bloggers out there. The conference runs from Feb 23 - 24, out at the [University of British Columbia](http://www.ubc.ca).

As a testament to the people who are running it, [they've even offered travel bursaries for those people who live out of town](http://www.northernvoice.ca/news/2007/01/12/get-a-travel-bursary-for-northern-voice), but would really like to attend the event. Also, here's a testimonial about last year's event:

> When I think about going to Northern Voice, I think about the community. I think about sharing secrets over sushi lunches and hanging out in the hallways. I think about discussions, dialogues that happen during the sessions, and quieter one-on-one conversations in corners. I think about some of my favorite bloggers, some of the people who inspired me most, who all happen to be together in one room in Vancouver on a Saturday in February.

I'm pretty excited to go down and check it out, meet some people, and learn a little more about blogging. Click on the link of Basco to read more about Northern Voice and to get your moose on. The photos are from last year's event.
