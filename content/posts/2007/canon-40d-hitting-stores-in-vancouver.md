So, I called around this morning, and the first trickle of the Canon 40Ds are hitting stores. Unfortunately, Canon is behind on manufacturing them, and there are tons of pre-orders, so the average Joe won't be able to buy one for some time. I have my name on a wait list, and I'm pretty sure I'll get mine on Tuesday, should I still want it. But since today was payday, and I have money sitting aside for it, I think I'll probably get it.
