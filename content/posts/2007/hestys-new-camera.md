So Hesty picked up a new Canon Digital Rebel XTi last week, and has been slowly uploading his new photos onto flickr. I love watching the photos that naturally come out of a purchase like this, and to see how everyone puts their own style and content into the photos they do.

Here's a shot Hesty took last night of his dog "playing" with a pillow.

You're a natural buddy.
