Recently I've written quite a lot about photography, and it's a trend that I intend to carry on. So, I've gone ahead and created a new photography RSS feed over on the top right for those people who wish to only subscribe to photography related information. If you know of any photography-related aggregators, feel free to pass that information on.

I have also added the photography subdomain, so you can view only the photography related entries by visiting [photography.duanestorey.com](http://photography.duanestorey.com). If you can pass some link love my way in the area of photography, that would be appreciated.

Thanks everyone.
