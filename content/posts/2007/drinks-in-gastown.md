So yesterday after work I strolled by the offices of [Bryght](http://www.bryght.com/) to say hi to Boris and Kris. We demolished a bunch of beers in pretty short order, and Boris and I got to catch up since the last time we hung out (which was well over a year ago). Afterwards, Andre and I headed over to [Six Acres](http://www.martiniboys.com/Vancouver/Six-Acres-review.html) in gastown to keep the beer flowing. When Andre left, I invited myself over to hang out with some flickr people that I hadn't really hung out with before. So, I got to finally put some faces to some names and make some new friends.

I'm not sure what's up for the rest of the weekend. I'm gonna take it pretty easy today and maybe just veg by the TV for a few hours.
