I'm in a hotel in Langley, and I've started to sort the photos from tonight. Having been to the location and having spent some time with old friends, I'm feeling a lot better about tomorrow.

I'm really glad I got a chance to try out a bunch of photos in a real setting, because I made a few mistakes that I likely won't make tomorrow. I'm gonna keep this short, because I still have lots to do. Next blog entry will probably be Sunday after everything is over.
