So everyone else is blogging this, so fuck it, I might as well too.

My friend [Raymi](http://raymitheminx.com) in Toronto has a very unique, and often copied, blog. So tonight, after getting a bit tipsy, I attempted to recreate some of her brilliance myself.

The end result is a funny parody, complete with drunk dancing by myself. You can check it out at [duanetheminx.com](http://duanetheminx.com).

Thanks to [Keira](http://www.keira-anne.com) for helping me put the header together. Clearly I need massive help.
