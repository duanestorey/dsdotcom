Now that I'm officially done what I came to do here in Finland, it's really time to let loose and party it up a bit... I just demolished my first beer here in the Oulu airport, and am now working on beer #2 waiting patiently for my plane to board. I've spent the last hour researching cool spots to go drink beer tonight in Helsinki, and I have a few in mind that I'm going to check out later.. I can't be too drunk or out too late tonight since I have lots to do in London tomorrow, but I'm going to do my best to drink as the locals do. Jari and Seppo impressed me with their drinking ability the other night, and I imagine the locals might be able to keep up with me tonight (perhaps even best me, although I haven't been bested in years). I remember the last person who said they could outdrink me (a certain 21 yr old guy at work), and how he stumbled away from the bar in shame, long before I had even started mumbling.

I would really love to take my DSLR out tonight, but I'm always really afraid of what's going to happen to it when I drink. Whenever I don't bring it out, I'm always disappointed with the great photo-ops that I miss. So I'm not really sure.. Van was really nice to lend me his $1500 24-70 f/2.8L lens, and it's been great having that lens here, since it's really an ideal walk around lens.

Anyways, just thought I'd drop a quick note here.. Next blog entry will probably be in Heathrow airport before my connecting flight to Vancouver.
