Years ago, while looking for something to read along the lines of fantasy, I encountered the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. Jordan's writing style is similar to Tolkien's in that he takes great efforts to relate back stories and flesh out all his characters. While I lost interest in the series a few years ago (mainly due to my impatience for waiting for a book to be written), I did enjoy it tremendously when I first started.

Today, Robert Jordan passed away from complications from primary amyloidosis. Rest in peace.
