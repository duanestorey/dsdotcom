When I lived in Ottawa, there were times when I used to get a little homesick and miss Vancouver and Chilliwack. When that happened, I was fortunate enough to stumble across a little website called [KatKam.ca](http://www.katkam.ca). It's a live webcam that points into the direction of the evening sunset, only a block or so away from my apartment in Vancouver. To this day, I always religiously check it out from time to time when I'm out of town, just to see what I'm missing back home.

Here's a shot of the sunset tonight that I missed. I'm heading to the airport now to fly up North. See you guys in about a week.
