Well, now that I've gotten all my weekend fun out of the way, I think I'm going to take it easy and relax. Of course, the first thing I'm going to do is warm up some left over lasagna, but then I have a bunch of web work I really want to get done. Plus, Sunday is usually laundry day, and I need to catch up on that.

I set up by Gmail/IMAP account on my Apple Mac Mail program. I'm not sure if I'm going to use it though. At least for me, it seems pretty slow. Not only does it seem to take forever to sync, but the CPU is fairly high even with the Mail program is idling. It might be related to the fact I have 16,000 emails in my gmail inbox, or maybe just another symptom of my dying Mac problems.

The backlog of Macs to fix in this city is fairly high, and there's still a one week wait at MacStation before they'll even look at it. So, I'm playing the waiting game now.
