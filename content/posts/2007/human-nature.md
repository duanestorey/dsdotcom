This is without a doubt one of the [most horrible things I have read in a while](http://asia.news.yahoo.com/070411/3/305uj.html).

> Watcharaporn Boonmak, 26, was ambushed by gunmen as she rode her motorcycle through a Muslim village in Yala, one of the three southern provinces roiled by three years of separatist insurgency in which more than 2,000 people have been killed.
> 
> "She might have been shot in the stomach before they set fire to her and her motorcycle," a Yala police officer, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters by telephone.
> 
> One of her relatives told Reuters that witnesses at the scene heard Watcharaporn, a garage clerk, screaming and crawling along the road for help but nobody dared respond for fear of reprisals.

I find it nearly incomprehensible that there are people out there that would do this to another human being. What has this world become?
