On May 5th, Flickr is having a big world-wide event were everyone is being asked to [record a day of their life in photos](http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2007/04/its_coming_24_h.html). I think this is a pretty cool idea, and it should make for some really interesting browsing when it's all over. Unfortunately for me, May 5th will probably involve mostly sleeping and chewing pain killers, but I'm definitely going to try and participate if I can.
