I went to my second of the Vancouver Young Professionals bi-weekly brunches today. Today was sushi down at Nikko Sushi on Robson Street, and the 12:15 start time allowed me to sleep in until about 11:30am or so (I love Sundays). Afterwards, a bunch of us braved the cold with some Starbucks and good laughter. Here are some shots from today.

The next big event is snowshoeing up on Grouse in a few weeks.
