On Friday night a bunch of us from work took Jari and Seppo out for one last night on the town in Vancouver. Since we basically accomplished everything we set out to do this week, we started drinking at around 4pm Friday afternoon at work. From there, we made our way to the Yaletown Brew Pub for dinner and some more drinks. I wasn't really sure what these guys would like to see (apparently at the end of the night it turns out they kind of wanted to see a strip club, affectionately called "The Titty Bar" in Finnish), so I sort of did a mini pub crawl with them. After YBC, we decided to hit up Glowbal briefly, which is a sort of pretentious martini bar smack in the middle of Yaletown (however, the bar definitely has its share of eye candy). We finished the night off down at the Atlantic Trap and Gill in a sea of cheap beer.

I spent the better part of my off work hours hanging out with Jari and Seppo and showing them around Vancouver this week. Despite living here for over ten years now, I was still suprised how beautiful I found the city as I was walking around the various areas. It's not very often I do a full tour of the entire downtown core, so it was really nice to see everything again, especially when the sunshine was out. On Wednesday night we even had a nice dinner at the top of Grouse Mountain.

While searching for interesting things for them to do, I actually even stumbled upon my old [Virtual Tourist](http://members.virtualtourist.com/m/3f98c/) page, complete with my own Vancouver tour guide. It was an intersting trip down memory lane. Now that they are gone, I'm going to settle back into my routine briefly while I await surgery, which could be as early as Tuesday now.
