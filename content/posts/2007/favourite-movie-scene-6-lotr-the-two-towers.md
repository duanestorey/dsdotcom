There are so many incredible scenes in The Lord Of The Rings, it's really difficult to single any of them out. The books were pretty influential in my early childhood, as well as shaping some of my literary and cinematic preferences in my teens. I am totally a LOTR geek, and even wore a little ring around my neck for a few months after reading the series for the first time. Actually, the first thing you see when you walk in the door at my Vancouver apartment is a framed poster of Aragorn from The Return of the King (so cool, I know).

When the movies came out, I was totally excited, and ended up seeing The Fellowship Of The Ring in Ottawa with a group of about ten people. We waited about four hours to see it on opening night. I saw the other two films on opening night as well, and caught the first showing in Vancouver of the Return Of The King, which started at midnight and ended around 3am.

I'll post a few other scenes in the future, but here's the final segment in the battle of Helm's Deep which is totally amazing. I love Shore's score for this part, along the vivid imagery from the hillside charge when the sun is rising.
