My friends Jason and Sheila had twins the other night (well technically, Sheila had twins, but I'm sure Jason did his part).

Jason sent an update email yesterday:

> Sheila and I are very proud to announce that the twins were born at 11:44 and 11:45 on Thursday, July 19th, 2007. Their names are Louis Marc Fischl and Hanna Michelle Fischl. Louis was born 6 lbs and Hanna was 5 lbs 7 ounces. Both babies and Mom are doing well and should be home from the hospital on Monday.

So drop Jason and Sheila a comment and congratulate them on their new family. Also, for all you old timers, give them some advice -- they'll need it!
