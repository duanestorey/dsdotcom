For all of you people who upgraded to Leopard and are using GMail, you have have noticed a few weird things going on. For me, my contacts no longer auto complete properly, and periodically all the javascript in gmail stops working.

I've checked a lot of newsgroups and many people are having the same problems. Apparently gmail has tried moving to a newer version that isn't really compatible with Safari 3.0 yet. The solution is to just go up to the top right in gmail and click "old version", which will roll back your GMail version to one that does work with Safari.

You're welcome :)
