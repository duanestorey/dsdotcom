Last night Jason and I went down to Morton's Steakhouse here in Vancouver for dinner. I've heard about it alot from friends and business people -- apparently it's one of the top three steak houses in Vancouver. I've been to Gotham before (which is also very nice), but it was my first time being at Morton's. Jason and I both agreed that it was better than Gotham, at least for the meal we had.

Afterwards, we met up with Cisco down at Cardero's on the water and had a few more drinks. All in all, a nice relaxing night on the town.
