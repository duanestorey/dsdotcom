Sometime in January, I thought I would finally throw some Google Adsense onto a few of my pages and see if I could make any cash at all. I didn't really have any expectations going into it, which is good because I'm sort of been pleasantly suprirsed.

In January, my adsense revenue was around $7, which is almost enough to cover the hosting costs in one month. In Feburary, the adsense revenue was around $22, which puts me squarely into the black for hosting costs. It'll be interesting to see what March holds, and how long it will take until I get that Google Beer Check.

I'll keep everyone updated as this cash cow continues to moo.
