One of my favourite movies of all time is a science fiction flick called "Dark City." Brennen and Jeff took me to it at the UBC theatre years ago, and we were all blown away. Surprisingly, not many people have watched it or even heard of it. When it came out, Roger Ebert took notice and gave it four stars, even going on to compare it to Pulp Fiction in terms of its cinematic perfection.

If you haven't seen it, I strongly suggest that you check it out. The row boat scene near the end is one of my favourite all time scenes in any movie I've watched (along the lines of the DeNiro - Pacino coffee-shop banter in "Heat"). Here's a decent [write up](http://www.doubleviking.com/real-men-love-i-dark-city-i--6512-p.html) about it as well.
