Last week, [John](http://www.audihertz.net/blog) got a hold of me on iChat and let me know about a Wordpress plugin competition. Since I have written a few of them, I thought I might as well enter the Crossroads Flickr plugin into the competition.

While the contest winners haven't been announced yet, they have announced all the participants [over at one of the sites](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/08/06/07-plugin-competition-prize-and-plugins-list/). If you are a user of the plugin, head on over and give it an honest rating.
