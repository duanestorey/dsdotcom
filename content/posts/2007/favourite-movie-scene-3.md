I hung out with some of my old high school friends tonight at a little Christmas dinner, and a few people brought up my recent blog posts about favourite movies scenes. We immediately launched into a big discussion about which other scenes were pretty awesome from our childhood memories, and I think we ended up with a list of about 20 or 30.

First movie we talked about was one Brennen and I totally loved years ago: Tombstone. Here's is the scene where Johnny Ringo and Doc Holliday have their final battle. Obvious spoilers ahead.
