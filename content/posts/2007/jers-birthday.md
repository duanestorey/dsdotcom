After work I swung by the Alibi room in Gastown to help celebrate Jeremy Crowle's birthday. I was a bit tired from this whole week so didn't end up staying out super late, but I managed to drink a few rum and diet cokes and buy Jer a beer.

There's another party tonight that I was invited to, but I'm not sure if I'll hit that. I think I really need a nice night inside with some movies. I have to hit the airport in a sec and drop my friend Hesty off for the start of his vacation. After that I'll probably check out the [Eastside Culture Crawl](http://www.eastsideculturecrawl.com/) with some friends.

Also, [Rebecca](http://www.miss604.com) and [John](http://www.audihertz.net/blog) are currently airborne heading down to Iowa for a week -- you guys better bring me back something really cool, like a cow.
