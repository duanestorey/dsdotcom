So in about 24 hours, I'll be boarding a plane and heading to Ottawa for Rob and Anna's wedding.. I'm getting pretty excited about the whole trip, and it will be good to check out Ottawa again after all these years. As I mentioned before, I'm flying the whole trip in business class (thanks for air miles), so I'm hoping it will be a pretty enjoyable flight. Sunday I fly to the Dominican Republic for a well deserved week of rest and relaxation.

Tonight I had a few friends over for what will probably be my last BBQ of the summer. [Keira](http://www.keira-anne.com), [Rebecca and](http://www.miss604.com) [John](http://www.audihertz.net/blog) swung by for a pretty meat-heavy evening of lamb, rib-eye and maui steak. Once I finish cleaning up, I'm going to pack my bags and get ready to head east.

Make sure you stay tuned for next week, as I'm hoping to get a bunch of wicked shots from around the Dominican Republic.
