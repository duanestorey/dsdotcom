I first met Vancouver's own [Miss604](http://www.miss604.com), Rebecca Bollwitt, last year at the Northern Voice blogging conference. I had checked out her blog occasionally, and I recognized her from photos both on her blog, and ones taken during Matthew Good's living room show last year. Being the social guy I am, and fueled by some liquid courage, I walked up to Rebecca (who was also on her way to acquire booze) and started chatting.

Since that time, I have gotten to know Rebecca and John quite well, and am proud to call them both good friends of mine.

Rebecca's blog is a witty ensemble of local Vancouver happenings, Surrey reflections, and of course, tons of Canucks related entries during hockey season. It's a daily pleasure to read, and it definitely presents a unique flare on what Vancouver life is like living in the downtown core.

So if you haven't ever gone over there, do yourself a favour and [go check it out](http://www.miss604.com).
