A new study says people who have full-fat milk gain \*less\* weight over time. I hate to say I told you so, but I'm not a big believer in the whole "fat makes you fat" belief. I agree saturated fat isn't very good for you, but the other types of fat are. As long as you don't eat the grissle in a steak, over 2/3 of the fat in it is good fat, which is better than most other things. Which gives me an idea for another blog entry later tonight.
