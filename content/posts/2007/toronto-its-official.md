[Tony](http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/bloggy.htm) officially booked all his flights and everything for New Year's in Toronto, at which point he tossed the email-gauntlet towards me and said "what's up now?' So, I have stepped up to the challenge and have also booked a flight for Toronto. Unfortunately, flying in Canada at that time of year is pretty pricy, so my flights are all at weird times to save money (and coming home it's a three-city milk-run).

I'll be spending Christmas at home with the family, and then heading out to Toronto to enjoy the cold for a few days. I'll probably have to call in a few favours and find a few couches to crash on out there, but I will definitely be showing up and enjoying some snow amongst friends.
