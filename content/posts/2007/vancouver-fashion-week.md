This weekend in Vancouver is the annual [Vancouver Fashion Week](http://www.vanfashionweek.com/main.php). I had the opportunity the other night to attend the opening bash down at Bar None in Yaletown. I had a really great time taking photographs and interacting with a lot of the local models and clothing designers.

There are events all weekend, so make sure to check out their main web site if you are interested in seeing some local fashion. I just got an email saying I was on the guest list for the swim suit portion today, so I may have to head out and check that out, even though I really don't have much time this weekend.

I also did a small post over at [Urban Vancouver](http://www.urbanvancouver.com/node/5631) if anyone is interested.
