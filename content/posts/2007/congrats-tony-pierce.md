I heard little bits of pieces of this last night, but just managed to read the real blog entry today. [Tony Pierce](http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/bloggy.htm) is going to be leaving LAist and will be heading over to the LA Times to run all of their blogs.

Congrats Tony, that's really awesome. First beer's on me out in TO bud.
