Easily one of my top ten films ever (well maybe top 20) is the rare gem that is Cameron Crowe's "Almost Famous." If you haven't seen it, you should immediately head out to the movie store and rent it. It's full of touching moments, laughter, self discovery and even a dash of romance.

Not only is the writing and story telling superb, but the photography and cinematography are both outstanding. I'll post a few scenes here I really like (obvious spoilers).

The scene on the bus after the Golden God bit is also classic:

It's all happening folks.
