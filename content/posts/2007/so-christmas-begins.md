Chad's party last weekend was the first of the Christmas bashes, but they are coming hard and fast starting tomorrow. I just picked up a new pair of dress pants and my altered jacket from the tailor, and tomorrow I'm spiffing it all out down on Granville Island. There should be a small little pre-party at my pad near False Creek, and then a small little ferry ride over to Bridges, which is a fairly nice seafood restaurant right on the edge of the marina. Kasia won't be coming to my place beforehand because she apparently needs a gazillion hours to get ready before hand, so we'll just have to manage without her.

Should be about 100 people or so, taking over the entire upper floor, so it's bound to be a pretty fun time. This year they up'ed the ante a bit and set up a dance floor along with a DJ. Considering I work for a company of mostly geeks, this is bound to be great entertainment. I'm bringing my camera, so I'll do my best to document it.

Afterwards, like usual, we'll all make our way to a pub or a club somewhere and start the second party of the evening (memories of me dancing on a speaker come to mind). Check back in a day or so for all the photos from the parties. I'm going to be fairly busy for the next few days so I'm not sure how much I'll be blogging.

I tried my best to enjoy last year's party, but considering four weeks prior I was in the hospital, and still had a pile of bruises on my face from my first surgery, I wasn't really in a total partying mood. But I'm fairly excited about tomorrow, and it should be great.
