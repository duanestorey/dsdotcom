As I was browsing the internet tonight and accidentally ran into a photo of mine on a website. So, while I was there, I figured I might as well see where else some of my photos have ended up.

- [Chris Blackburn used one of my HDR shots in a blog posting](http://www.chrisblackburn.com/blog/2007/01/pictures_in_lumina.php)
- [A shot of Boris used in a blog entry](http://www.buffmuthers.com/~midge/archives/2007_05.html)
- [My HDR shot of Kitsilano used on the Kitsilano.ca website](http://kitsilano.typepad.com/kitsilano/2007/01/twilight_over_k.html)
- [My aurora shots on the NASA website](http://science.nasa.gov/spaceweather/aurora/gallery_01oct03_page3.html)
- [A photo of Rebecca on her blog](http://www.miss604.com/2007/05/blogging-to-a-job.html)
- [Las Vegas Travel Blog](http://city-guide.cc/index.php?s=vancouver)

As I was tracking these down in Google, I realized how nice a feature it would be if [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) had some sort of trackback mechanism, then you could see who was using your photos on the web.
