Well, it's now official -- not only am I officially 30, but I have also survived my 30th birthday party. Thanks to everyone who came out to enjoy a few beers. In my case, thanks to all the shots, I drank way more than I'm used to. While I had a great time, unfortunately I slipped down the stairs at Honey and lost my glasses long enough for a few people to step on them. So, apparently I'll be visiting the eyeglass store this week to put in a new order.

Thanks everyone who popped by.

I have a meeting with my plastic surgeon on Friday, and from there I'll know when I'll have my second surgery, which will most likely be within about 10 days after the meeting.
