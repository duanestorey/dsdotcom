Heat is a totally awesome movie starring both Al Pacino and Robert Deniro. There are many classic scenes in it, but one that stands out is the coffee shop banter between Pacino and Deniro where we learn a pile about both characters. This type of scene has been used in countless movies since then, but they all basically pay homage to this part.

Why I think it's so fascinating is that both characters open up to each other and somehow relate, even though they are basically enemies by trade. And let's be honest, Deniro and Pacino both kick ass.
