Rebecca (aka [Miss604](http://www.miss604.com)) is participating in a blogathon tomorrow to support a local Surrey charity.. So, I'd appreciate it if you spend tomorrow over on her site, reading her posts (one every 30 minutes for 24 hours straight), and hopefully dropping a small contribution her way.

I plan to submit an entry or two during the day to help her out, so please drop by and give her some moral support! Thanks!
