So, I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but whatever. I've been messing in garage band for about six months now, wanting to record something but just not sure what to record. I used to be in choir over 20 years ago, and I can sort of carry a tune. I know I need to have a ton of practice to get anywhere close to where I used to be as a kid (and most of my practice was pre-puberty, so I have to re-learn a deeper voice), but I decided to get over the hump and just quickly record something and take my beats for it.

When I was out in Toronto visiting everyone, Raymi pointed me at this song called Mad World by Gary Jules. I decided to cover it quickly in Garage Band using an acoustic guitar. I recorded everything using a shitty USB condenser microphone (resting sideways on my desk) I picked up at Tom Lee a while ago. I know I'm out of key in a pile of places (this is definitely at the top edge of my vocal range), but considering this is my second take, and I haven't even tried singing in about 15 years, I don't think it's horrible.

I know John hates the reverb, so I'll try and do another version on the weekend with a better vocal track and less reverb.
