I accidentally ran into this song the other day on my iPod (yes, I have lots of music I haven't heard before on my iPod), and there's something about it I really liked. I've been working on playing it myself, and I'm pretty close. It's rather hard (for me) to pick this song and try singing at the same time, but I'm getting better. In the video the other guy is doing most of the guitar work.

Check it out. It's an acoustic version they recorded at MTV.
