This is [hot off the presses](http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/12/18/film.thehobbit.ap/index.html).

> Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema have reached agreement to make J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit," a planned prequel to the blockbuster trilogy "The Lord of the Rings."
> 
> Peter Jackson is set to oversee the film adaptation of "The Hobbit."
> 
> Jackson, who directed the "Rings" trilogy, will serve as executive producer for "The Hobbit." A director for the prequel films has yet to be named.
> 
> Relations between Jackson and New Line had soured after "Rings," despite a collective worldwide box office gross of nearly $3 billion -- an enormous success. The two sides nevertheless were able to reconcile, with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios (MGM) splitting "The Hobbit" 50/50, spokemen for both studios said Tuesday.

I'm definitely glad that Peter Jackson is involved in this project. I think the potential to completely screw it up, especially given the commercial success of the first trilogy, is huge.
