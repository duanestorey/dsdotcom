![](images/apple%20logo.jpg)I've been waiting patiently for this update, since I've had quite a few problems with wireless since switching to Leopard. I also need to drop my Mac off at the repair facility to probably replace the logic board in it, since I've been having weird LCD and sleep problems on my Mac. Unfortunately, there seems to be over a week delay at MacStation for even looking at these things, which means I'll basically be computerless for a while. I'm sure I'll survive, but will be weird not to have a computer at home. Maybe I can go back to doing "normal" things again for a while.

To get the new update, just go to the Apple Menu and pick Software Update. You can read about [some of the changes here.](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/os-x-leopard/leopard-1051-update-coming-heres-the-list-of-fixes-323268.php)

I'll let everyone know how it goes when I'm all done.
