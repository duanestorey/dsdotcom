I've sort of gotten tired of dragging my big digital SLR with me everywhere, so lately I've been taking along my little Canon point and shoot, which by comparison takes garbage photos, but the size and weight of it is attractive. I've been thinking I might start taking a pile more videos just for the hell of it.

While this video is completely boring, I just decided to give a quick virtual tour of my apartment, with a quick video of how nice a day it is in Vancouver.

Don't worry, they'll get better.
