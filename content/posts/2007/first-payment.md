Today I got paid for my first photo gig, which is pretty exciting. I'm currently setting up an area dedicated to photography, and it should be done sometime this weekend. I've set up a professional account at [smugmug.com](http://www.smugmug.com) where I can put some of my better photos from around Vancouver and make them available for purchase. This will also let me sell wedding photos etc when the time comes.

I'll post more information when it's all done.
