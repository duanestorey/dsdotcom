I don't think it's really possible. Clearly a $5 Santa hat is what I was missing in life.

Normally I'd just leave it as that, but I just did a semi-buzzed iChat with [Rebecca](http://www.miss604.com) and [John](http://www.audihertz.net/blog), and we all just laid the smack down on the word [CUTE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cute), so I'm gonna post it here.
