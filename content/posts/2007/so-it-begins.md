My mom just emailed me and asked if I had started decorating my apartment yet. I figured I'd throw a photo up just to show her and everyone else.

Still have a ways to go, but it's looking not bad. I have another strand of lights to put up somewhere, and I might get some for my patio. I also have some of those Christmas house things to put up, and I even have some fake snow for them.
