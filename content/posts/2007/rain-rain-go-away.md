Is it just me, or was this one of the shittiest summers we've had in a long time? It seems like anytime I looked out my window in the morning with thoughts of doing something outdoors it was either cold or rainy. Obviously today is no exception.

Interestingly enough, while down in the Dominican Republic, most people there said the same thing -- that this was one of the worst summers they can remember. I'm fairly certain the UK set a rain record this summer, based on something I heard and read while down in the Caribbean.

Unlike most of my friends, I'm not particular fond of summer. It's nice that it's clear outside and to have the sun shining, but my kind of weather is more like last week, where it was sunny but not to warm. I'm more of a jeans guy than a shorts guy, so it's nice to be able to walk around without a jacket.

While the forecast for the weekend is still sunshine, I've been watching the HIGH temperatures on my Mac widget dropping steadily, and I'm fairly certain we've seen the end of summer. Which is obviously a bit sad since I wanted to get in one more quick camping trip before the rain takes over again.
