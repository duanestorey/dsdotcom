This bad boy is going through the Caribbean right now. I sure hope it's gone by the time I get there. My trip to Cuba in 2001 had to be postponed due to [Hurricane Michelle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Michelle), and I made it as far as Toronto before they sent us home. Back then they gave us a full refund, but usually when this happens you lose your money entirely.
