I was out at Waves Coffee until around 2:10am last night, which was an interesting experience unto itself. The first question I have is for all you ladies -- how come the majority of you are dating dipshits? Pretty much every girl that walked in last night had some idiot guy attached to her. This one in particular reminded me of the typical drug dealer back home -- you know, with the fancy phone, crooked hat, tons of jewelry, and an attitude that just wouldn't quit. The guy had his girlfriend running errands in the coffeeshop for him while he sat and tried to degrade her verbally. Even after she put a package lunch together for him (apparently so he'd have something to eat the next day), he still cut her down. Thankfully they left as I was approaching my "idiot-tolerance-level", but not before the girl shot a look at me and muttered under her breath "what an asshole," referring of course to that guy.

Later this one couple came in and did a Lady and the Tramp at the table using a cup of coffee. It was one of the most disturbing things I have seen in a long time.

In other news, I also picked up a new driver's license today. A few years ago one of the local nightclubs ran it through one of their machines and tossed it back at me in two pieces. I was like "ok great, you're going to replace that for me right?" Three years later I finally got a new one, and no longer have to use my passport as ID, which is rather nice.

Other than that, I'm just going to lay low for the rest of the weekend. I have a nice pan of bacon sizzling right now, and will pound it back with some coffee. I might even venture outside at get some sun at some point, which will be rather nice.
