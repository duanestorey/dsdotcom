I just got off the phone with Shaw Cable, and have finally completed my disconnection. I basically only watched 24 on TV, and now that it's over, I really can't justify paying $70/mo for it.

So, so long Shaw, and thanks for the memories.

To that end, I'm now selling the following:

1) Sony Progressive Scan DVD player with Remote 2) Shaw High Definition Digital Cable Box

My dad gets first dibs on #2, but if he doesn't want it, I'm open to offers before it goes on eBay. I paid $400 new for it, and $120 for the DVD player.
