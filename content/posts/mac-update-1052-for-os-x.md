For all of you who have been waiting patiently for the new 10.5.2 update, the wait is over. 10.5.2 is now available on software update. I'm installing all 350 MB of it right now.

For all of you about to update, I salute you.

Oh, and for all you people on shitty broadband, you should know I just downloaded 352 MB in 4 minutes here.
