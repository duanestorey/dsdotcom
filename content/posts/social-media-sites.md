I'm planning to hit Vancouver on Saturday sometime and spend a week or so in the city checking things out. As I mentioned before, I'll be working during the days, most likely near Gastown. At lunch and in the evenings I'll hopefully be bouncing around with my camera, taking photos or checking out what's going on outside of most official venues.

I made a few small changes to this site to facilitate me writing posts during the Olympics. [The main page](/) has been changed to show Olympic related posts, and I've added a Flickr gallery to the bottom which will ultimately start showing all the photos I'll be taking. I also set up a 2010 Posterous account over a [2010.duanestorey.com](http://2010.duanestorey.com), which I'll use to post things on the fly from my iPhone mainly. I've also set up an aggregated feed of all my content on this site as well as over on 2010.duanestorey.com. If you're interested in that, [subscribe to it here](feed://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=ebfccaf99a8aed225bf384631de7a7e3&_render=rss).
