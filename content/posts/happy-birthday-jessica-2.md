![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3465/3699825457_6d4b922540.jpg?v=1247033526)Years ago I was in the lab at UBC when I got a call telling me that my sister was in labour. A few hours later I was back in Chilliwack, and Jessica, my niece, was welcomed into this world. Over the course of her life, I unfortunately haven't been around as much as I would have liked. But thankfully now I'm in Chilliwack and I can spend more time with her.

One time I was back in Chilliwack visiting and decided I wanted to get a Whopper from Burger King. Jessica asked if she could come with me, so we went together. Here's a photo of Jessica with her jar of bees and her flower.

Happy Birthday Jessica -- your uncle loves you!
