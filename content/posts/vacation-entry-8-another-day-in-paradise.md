This will be a short entry, but I just wanted to say how great this place is. The people I've met have been super friendly, and the weather is pretty amazing. I took a pile of photos yesterday from around the pool.

Unfortunately, upon waking up this morning, I've encountered some fairly serious camera problems. The first is that my DLSR body refuses to turn on now. It was working last night when I went to sleep, but now it just refuses to do anything. I suspect that due to the heat and humidity it's being stubborn, but it's not looking good right now. The other serious issue is that my 70-200mm f/2.8L is full of water vapour. I have no idea how that happened, since it was in my bag the entire day, and my bag wasn't really near the pool. I was taking shots with the 17-40mm f/4L all day, and that one is completely fine. What sucks is that the L-series lenses are Canon's professional line, and they are supposed to be weather sealed so things like that can't happen.

So, as of right now, I'm completely cameraless. I didn't even bring my back-up film body, so I'm stuck trying to sort this out. I'm going to put everything under the A/C this afternoon for a few hours and see if that helps, but I suspect both the camera body and the lens will require servicing when I get back to Canada. If the body has been damaged by water, it's probably close to being a write-off. That's not completely bad, since I've been saving for a new body this year anyways. The lens however needs to be fixed, as it's my favourite one in my kit, and costs $1600 new. I'll keep everyone up to date.

I'm gonna head back to my room and read for a while and try to air out my camera. After that, I'm not sure -- maybe head to the plaza to see about going on a trip tomorrow somewhere.

**Update - the DLSR body appears to be working again. A little time under the A/C seems to have recharged it. The lens is pretty screwed though, so I dunno what to do about that. I still don't really understand how it happened.**
