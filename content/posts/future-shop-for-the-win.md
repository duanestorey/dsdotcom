I went out tonight and bought a new digital camera, the [Canon SD 870 IS](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canonsd870is/). I did some basic research before hand and that was one of about three cameras I considered buying for this upcoming weekend. What sold me on it was that a guy at work recently picked it up and heaped a pile of praise on it. Also, it's the only camera in it's class that had image stabilization \*and\* a useful wideangle end (something most cameras lack of this size).

This is, unfortunately, probably the 8th digital camera I've purchased in about as many years. Several of them had untimely deaths, and one was even the victim of a previous girlfriend's stupidity. I have an older model Canon Digital ELPH that hit the floor hard in a New York bar a few years ago, and it's never been the same. So hopefully this one doesn't break on me.

After I got home tonight, I unpacked the camera, only to realize that it was missing the battery. It's obviously a major bummer to come home with a new tech toy only to realize you can't use it. I called Future Shop and they said to just come back and they'd get me another one.

When I got to Future Shop, I explained what happened to one of the sale's people, who immediately went and talked to the manager. I wasn't sure what was going on, but I really wasn't in the mood to have to argue my case with anyone. When the guy returned, he apologized for what happened and then threw $80 worth of free stuff at me for my time. I didn't even ask.

I don't really have a lot of love for Future Shop, but it was pretty cool of them to give me a new battery pack and throw in some free stuff, including a nice leather case. I've done some bashing of those guys on my blog in the past, so I figure it's only fair to point out this time when they actually came through.
