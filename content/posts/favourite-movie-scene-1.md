No, the number 1 doesn't mean this is my all time favourite movie scene, because I plan to post a lot of these over the next few weeks, and I haven't even thought about ranking them yet. However, I've always really liked this one scene. I could care less if you hate Tom Cruise or think his religion is bogus (even though it is) -- this scene is pretty high up there in terms of cinematic perfection in my mind.

As a whole, Vanilla Sky wasn't that great, but this last scene, with the music, the wisps of romance, the vibrant vanilla sky, the New York landscape, and the thought of what it must be like to suddenly realize your life is nothing more than a dream makes for a powerful ending IMO - the realization that everything you ever loved died a long time ago along with the excitement of having a second chance at life.

Maybe some of that is the hopeless romantic in me, but this is one of the few scenes that I can watch over and over again.

Feel free to chime in on what you thought about the movie or the scene.
