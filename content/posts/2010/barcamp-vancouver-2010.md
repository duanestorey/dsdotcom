Tomorrow is the kick-off party for BarCamp Vancouver. While I do indeed have a ticket, I'm not entirely sure I'm going to be able to make it at this point. I'm right at the end of a huge client deliverable, and my attendance will depend on whether or not I can get it all done tomorrow. In addition, I'm also hoping to start moving things into storage this weekend if I can.

That said, I've been to a few other BarCamp Vancouver events before, and am hoping to make an appearance at the party if I can. BarCamp is an _unconference_ - attendees put conference suggestions on a board, and everyone votes on what they'd like to hear about. It's a great concept, and most people come away not only learning about new concepts, but also helping others to learn new concepts.

Tomorrow night is the party down at the Waldorf Hotel. Afterwards, many of the hardcores will start hacking away on some projects, ultimately spending the night at the facility and waking up for the unconference in the morning.

It's a great time, and I'm really hoping to make it out for at least a beer or two. If you see me there, make sure you come by and say hi.

I'll be the really tired guy with two beers.
