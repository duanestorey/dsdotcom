Given that summer is just around the corner (at least, I hope it is -- it's really hard to tell with this weather), I decided about 6 weeks ago to try and get in better shape. One of the things I wanted to do when I moved out to Chilliwack was to be a bit healthier. I've definitely done that in terms of what I eat, but not so much in terms of how much exercise I get in a typical week. Summer is usually better for me as I like hiking and playing tennis, so I'm sure it'll increase.

When I got back from Hamilton at the start of March I decided to start hitting the gym hard and being very critical of what I eat or drink. I've had the occasional beer, but for the most part I haven't really been drinking all that much (burning 400 calories at the gym and then drinking 1,500 calories worth of beer seems counterproductive, even by engineering math).

Anyways, down 12 pounds so far and I'm on the last hole on my belt. Like the tortoise, slow and steady wins the race.
