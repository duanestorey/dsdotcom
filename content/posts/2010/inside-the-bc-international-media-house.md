I actually didn't apply for a media pass, so I technically do not have access to the BC International Media Center. That said, if you have access, you can sign people in as visitors, so I'm currently down here as a guest of [John Biehler](http://www.johnbiehler.com).

Here's a quick video that John and I shot to give everyone a little tour of what it's like inside.
