I have a portable hard drive that I'm taking with me on my travels, partially to back up my main laptop from time to time, and partially because it contains a large percentage of my personal movie collection on it.

That said, I'm going to try and get a pile of movies on there that I haven't seen yet so I have something when I'm on train rides or in hostels and what-not.

So, I'd appreciate it if people can leave a list in the comments of some of their favourite movies, or anything they've seen in the last few years they thought was really awesome. Thanks!
