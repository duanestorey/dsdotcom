I've made a few posts about the little tube amp project I'm probably going to tackle in the fall, but decided to put the entries on its own blog, as I want it to be a single glimpse into a big design and build process. If you want to follow along, subscribe to the feed over at [tubeamp.posterous.com](http://tubeamp.posterous.com/). It'll probably only be an entry every week or so for the next few months as I debate things in my head, but I'm hoping to be in a position to build something in the fall or early winter.
