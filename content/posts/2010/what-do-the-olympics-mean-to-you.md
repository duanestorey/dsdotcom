I went down to the Atlantic House the other day with [Rebecca](http://www.miss604.com), [John Bollwitt](http://www.johnbollwitt.com), and [John Biehler](http://www.johnbiehler.com). We did our best to help the Atlantic House with their excess beer problem, and eventually had to solicit the help of a few other people, namely Robert Scales and Kris Krug, who happened to be in the area and swung by.

Since I had my video camera on me, I thought I would take a quick stroll and see if I could find out what some of the people in Atlantic House thought about the Olympics. The end result is this 13 minute video, which I'm hoping to have on Blip.TV and/or YouTube sometime soon.
