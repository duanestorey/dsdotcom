A while ago I decided that I would take a little break and have a little 'me time'. I've bounced around a few ideas in my head, and ultimately come up with a pretty good weekend adventure. I've been keeping the actual location to myself, simply because I want to just disappear for a few days, put the cell phone on vibrate, and get in a little rest and relaxation.

The last vacation I took was back at the end of last November, so it's been nearly six months without a break. I don't really feel like I need a week off at this point, but a nice relaxing weekend adventure complete with a few days of sleeping in is going to be pretty nice. I cashed in some points on travel VISA and purchased two nights in a one bedroom suite in a lakeside hotel. It has a full kitchen and a gas fireplace, so I'm looking forward to dabbling a bit in the kitchen with some (hopefully) local foods, and reading a few chapters on my iPad. I haven't really taken many photos in months, so I'll probably haul my camera along with me and do a few photowalks.

I have a few weeks off planned for the summer, one of which I'll spend bouncing around Vancouver Island, and probably another one later in the summer where I can bounce around locally and maybe do some camping close to home. But prior to then, I have my little weekend adventure coming up. I'm actually pretty excited about it.
