About a year ago I reverted this site to a simple theme, mainly because I haven't been entirely sure what to do with it. I set out about six weeks ago to do a refresh of this site that would cater to some of my upcoming travel adventures. As I got about half way on it, I realized it probably would make more sense to do a dedicated travel site catering to people who want to explore world travel and also for traveling techies like my self to get more information about some of the places I've visited.

So, that's what I ended up doing. My new site is called _The Migratory Nerd_, and is at [themigratorynerd.com](http://themigratorynerd.com). It also has a dedicated Twitter account at [@migratorynerd](http://twitter.com/migratorynerd).

I'll still update this site from time to time, mostly about personal items, but most of my blog entries going forward (at least over the next year) will be over on [themigratorynerd.com](http://themigratorynerd.com). So if you're interested in travel or seeing what I get up to as I bounce around South America and Europe, check it out!
