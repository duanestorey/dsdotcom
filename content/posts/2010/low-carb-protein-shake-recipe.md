Now that I have a blender, I've been experimenting with a few variations of a low-carb protein shake at home. My best iteration so far is a chocolate and banana flavoured protein shake. Here's how to make it:

- 125 ml of normal or unsweetened soy milk
- 6 ice cubes
- 2 tablespoons of whey protein isolate
- 2 tablespoons of ground flax seed
- 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder
- 1 cap-full of banana extract
- 3/4 of a teaspoon of stevia sweetener
- 1/4 teaspoon of Xanthan gum

Put all of that in a blender and chop/mix it all up. It's actually pretty tasty.
