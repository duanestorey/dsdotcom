John Biehler and I decided to grab some grub around 7pm tonight, but unfortunately, had a hard time finding a place that could initially accommodate us. The first pub we tried to get into (on the corner of Robson and Granville) was completely full, so we decided to try the Kingston Pub on Richards street.

While it was also extremely full, they managed to find room for the two of us downstairs near the large screen TV. Shortly afterwards Rebecca and John showed up, and we watched the Women's Mogul event while sipping a few beers. When Jenn Heil started her final run, I turned my video camera on, thinking we might be catching a piece of Canadian and Olympic history (Canada has never won a gold medal while hosting the games at home).

Unfortunately, we didn't get the gold, but it was still an amazing achievement for Jenn Heil and for Canada. If you're on Twitter, feel free to send [JennHeil](http://twitter.com/jennheil) a message.
