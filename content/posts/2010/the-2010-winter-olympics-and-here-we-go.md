Well, here we are, two days away from the start of the Winter Olympics. As everyone knows, the event is massively over budget. The last time I checked, the total cost (thus far) of the Winter Olympics was at 6 billion dollars, the majority of which was paid for by the people of British Columbia.

I've been on the fence for a while now about whether or not I want to be in town for the Olympics. I didn't vote for them, but at the same time, here they are, and there's no going back now. So to that end, I finally decided that I'm going to try to be in Vancouver for at least a week during the games to ultimately see what they are all about, and see if I can help bring exposure to what it's like to be a tourist in your own city for a period of time.

As many people know, Dave O. started the [True North Media House](http://truenorthmediahouse.com) initiative last year as a way to have social media band together to tell the real story behind the games from a semi-grassroots perspective. Many other of my friends are part of the initiative, including [Rebecca Bollwitt](http://www.miss604.com), [John Bollwitt](http://www.johnbollwitt), and [John Biehler](http://www.johnbiehler.com). So to that end, I'm going to head into the city on the weekend and probably set up shop for a week or so, spending my evenings walking around town with my camera and hopefully bringing a people's perspective to the event, similar to what I did when I was backstage at the 2008 Canadian Juno Awards in Calgary.

Dave O. has graciously offered me a piece of floor where I can set up an air mattress, so as of this moment, that'll probably be home for next week. Boris Mann and [Bootup Labs](http://www.bootuplabs.com) have offered me a place to work during the week, so I'll have a place with WiFi for my normal day-to-day activities. But other than that, I'll probably switch into Olympics mode on this site in the near future.

I'm still working out the logistics of everything, including debating buying a Canon 5D Mark II in the next day or two to finally have a full frame camera. Once I have my plans finalized I'll switch a few things around on this site and head out into the city with my camera.
