Almost time to get in a plane. Tomorrow night I'll pack everything up and get ready for a trip down to the states on Friday. Definitely looking forward to the weekend, and also being on the other side of it since it's the last real event of the summer before I can downshift a few gears and take things a bit slower again.

I probably won't post again until WordCamp, but who knows.
