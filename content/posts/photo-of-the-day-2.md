So I just checked, and 17 people have joined my photo of the day flickr group, which is totally awesome. If you know of anyone else, please invite them, because I'm pretty sure I'm going to get some prizes going, and it's a great way to have fun and learn off each other.

I did a bit more work on the site tonight, so check out [the photo of the day website](http://photooftheday.duanestorey.com) to see what has changed. Today's photo of the day is below, and it's by [Keira](http://http://keira-annemellis.blogspot.com/). Keep those photos coming everyone. If you have a blog and want to throw some link love to the photo of the day site, that would be awesome. I actually have some really cool ideas for it once it starts getting a bit more traffic. Also, if you like what you see, drop a few comments to let the photo taker know that you liked it.

Keep up the good work fellow photo takers!
