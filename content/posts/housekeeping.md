A few people convinced me to finally ante up and get a house keeper, since a) my place is usually messy and b) I don't really have much time to spend cleaning.

She's in the bathroom right now, and she stepped out for a brief second to say: "wow, you're pretty messy eh?" with a cute smile.

I think I can get used to having cute girls come to my place every few weeks and clean. Thankfully my place is going to be (and stay) spotless after all this.

One girl came on Friday to clean the living room and kitchen, but ran out of time before finishing it all off (due to a prior constraint). So, the other girl is here now finishing it all off.

At first, the whole idea of spending money to have someone clean my place seemed a bit pretentious, but having lived in a really clean kitchen and living room this weekend, it's really pretty awesome reading a book on the couch in a clean and fresh smelling room. Since I suck at cleaning, it easily takes me 3 or 4 hours a week to keep my apartment in a somewhat screwed up state. So, paying someone $100 a month to free up that time each week to do something else is a pretty good investment I'm thinking.
