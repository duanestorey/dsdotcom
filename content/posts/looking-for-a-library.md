As I mentioned before, I have tons of engineering and science books here, most of which I'm looking to get rid of. I could of course just drop them all off at the library, but I'm aware that some libraries actually give receipts for charitable donations, and I would prefer to use one of those (for obvious tax purposes). Can anyone recommend any library in the Fraser Valley or Greater Vancouver Area that might offer something like that?

Thanks.
