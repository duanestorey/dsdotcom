I'm a big fan of American IPAs, and it's usually what I drink when I'm lounging around home and I feel the need for a beer. Here are the target stats for this brew:

- ABV: 6.5%
- Color: 8

**Water Treatment**

I recently checked out my town's (Chilliwack's) water report and have been experimenting with brew-salt additions. Based on my water and a target profile of a hop-forward beer, these were the additions I made.

- 7g Gypsum
- 1g Salt

**Fermentation**

- Yeast: Wyeast 1056
- Temperature: 68F
- Duration: 2 Weeks
- Dry-hopping: 2oz, as listed above

### Notes

I haven't tasted this one yet, as it's still in the fermenter at home (6 weeks basically). I'll dry-hop it when I get back, cold-crash it, and then keg it. I'll have my first pint in a few weeks and update this post.
