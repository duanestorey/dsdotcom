I watched Test The Nation tonight to see how the Bloggers and Rebecca faired on the show. The bloggers, in pure geeky awesomeness, managed the win!

Here's a shot of Rebecca holding the winning trophy!

Congrats guys! You did us all proud.

[John Biehler](http://johnbiehler.com/) posted some great clips of Rebecca rocking Test The Nation. Check it out (and listen to the idiots booing in the background -- I guess they thought they'd win?)

I'm bookmarking your blog too.
