I've been busy lately, busier in fact that I've been in quite some time. WPtouch 2.0 Pro has been a lot of work and a lot of fun, and we're getting ready to release it shortly. If you're interested in checking it out, [sign up for updates](http://wptouch.com).

WordCamp Vancouver is this weekend as well, and the last week especially has been a lot of work. The event is shaping up to be really great, so I'm definitely looking forward to being there. That said, I'm also looking forward to being on the other side of it so I can get back into my normal routine. With everything going on these last few weeks, I haven't really been sleeping as much as my body would like. As a result I find I'm pretty drained, and have unfortunately been relying pretty heavy on caffeine, something I'm looking forward to reducing again shortly.

I haven't had a real break since my trip to Punta Cana at the end of November, so I'm looking forward to having a little downtime. If the weather is nice next week, I'll probably head up to the lake and spend a few nights by a campfire. I have a family camping trip coming up in a few weeks that should be fun, as well as a few random weeks off in the coming months.

As soon as I have a bit of free time, I'm going to change things around here. In fact, given that I don't really need this site to help get jobs or to have my resume online, I'm thinking about getting rid of it entirely. I still like writing, and plan to do some more, but I'd actually like to start with a clean slate, and start writing content that's a bit more focused. For example, I really enjoy writing about finances and business, so I'd like to start writing more routinely in that area. I'm pretty fond of how Posterous works, so I may try using that for a while. But who knows.

I've also been seriously debating killing my Facebook and Twitter accounts. Truthfully, I don't really see a lot of value in either of them these days, and find that in both cases they are pretty big distractions. I've been trying to reduce all my notifications from them, which helps, but it's still too much traffic for my liking. Obviously I wouldn't delete either them, but I may try weening myself off of both and seeing how life is without either of them again.

But that said, I'm in good spirits and looking forward to the summer and for the release of WPtouch. BraveNewCode's second year-end is actually coming to a close, which seems strange considering it doesn't seem that long ago we started it up.

For those of you going to WordCamp Vancouver, see you in a few days.
