I [read this a few minutes ago](http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/12/06/missing.family/index.html). I can only imagine the courage a father must have to sit in a car for nine days with his family, and then venture out alone in the cold snowy wilderness to find help. He made it eight miles on his own, even though search guys could hardly cover any ground themselves in those conditions.

> "It seems superhuman to me that he was able to cover that amount of distance given what he had and also that he had nine days in the car" before setting out, Josephine County Undersheriff Brian Anderson said.

> "I'm amazed," searcher Robert Graham told reporters. "We spent hours down there and made very little distance. ... The conditions were very rough. It's been cold, the terrain is so rugged, just spending one day out here is very exhausting."

Unfortunately, he didn't make it. He was a senior editor for CNET, and he had two kids.
