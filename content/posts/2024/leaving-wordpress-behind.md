This is my first post in a long time, as you can tell. One of the reasons I'm writing 
an entry is due to what's been going on in the WordPress world. In case you've been living under a rock,
there is currently a big public battle going on between Matt Mullenweg, the company he runs, 'Automattic', and a rival 
called WP Engine.

I can only speculate as to the real reasons for this public spat. On its surface, one side claims it's about a trademark dispute. But based on the actions of 
that same side, it seems to be some poorly thought out plan to exert more control over the community, and to attempt to extract revenue out of hosting providers 
in the WordPress sphere under the guise of a trademark license. 

Many members of the WordPress community, myself included, feel that recent actions taken by Matt and Automattic have been 
been unethical and against the very principles of open-source itself.  As a previous plugin author that once had
over five million downloads of one of my plugins, I was completely shocked that WordPress would usurp someone else's plugin and call it a fork
(without changing the slug).  In addition, many of the communications from the official WordPress channels have shown complete contempt for the 
very community it claims to represent. I find this all repulsive.

My modus operandi is pretty simple - I believe what's fair and true for one person or group should be fair and true for any other group or individual.  That's it.
I believe if we have rules and guidelines that they should apply to everyone, and not be enforced selectively.  

That's why I don't think it's right that someone can go up
on stage at WordCamp US and disparage a $75,000 sponsor, when any other member of that same community would have likely received a ban for that same episode. I don't 
think it's fair to provide WordPress.org services to some users, and not to others due to a business disagreement (especially since there are literaly 1500 hardcoded references in the WordPress source code 
pointing to WordPress.org).  If the WordPress.org services are to be pay to play, that's fine, simply set a price so we can all pay and continue to use it. Or transfer it 
all to the Foundation and do a proper fundraising campaign so businesses help pay for it.  But no business or individual should ever have to worry about 
accessing the WordPress.org site, especially one who is alledgedly on the receiving end of an extortion campaign.  If we are to believe that WordPress.org isn't a critical part of using WordPress, then Automattic should set about removing all 1500 instances of it within the code and simply have configurable update services.

I have been pretty vocal on X over the last few weeks due to all of this, partially to support the many community members who have been ostracized for expressing displeasure, and
partially to continue to help advocate for the community that did so much to help me over the last 15 years.  It's been extremely hard to watch members of the 
community, many of whom I've had beers with or been at WordCamps with, be selectively discarded for having opposing viewpoints. I have personally been blocked on 
X by Matt, Automattic, and by the WordPress account itself. Sadly, it's become somewhat of a badge of honour, meaning at least we went out 
standing up for what we believed in instead of staying silent.

With that in mind, I've been personally saddened that many of the more popular plugin 
authors (many of which I traded emails with and calls back in the day) have refused to publicy have a stance on this, probably hoping that this will all go
away soon and they can just get back to business as usual.  These are trusted members of the community whose opinions and guidance would be appreciated at a time like this.
And yet, their defeaning silence has reverberated through the fractured community.  

I do not believe this is the time for silence in the WordPress community. It's fine to not take a side, but it's not
fine to act like nothing is happening.  Not while contributors are quitting, members on Slack are getting banned, community members on X are getting blocked, 
and the official WordPress accounts continue to talk down to their followers. Everybody should be speaking up now and advocating for what they believe in.

WordPress isn't a spring chicken anymore - it's been around over 20 years now, and powers 43% of the web. The codebase and the community owes much of its success to the thousands of 
core, plugin, and theme contributors who submitted their work for free. I'd tried to do my part to contribute
the success of WordPress in the early days, helping in the following ways:
* I co-organized and ran three separate WordCamps in the Vancouver area (the photo above is from WordCamp Whistler, an event I 
was not able to do twice due to the excessive limitations imposed by the WordPress Foundation). 
* In the early days, I helped sponsor many WordCamp events around the world, the majority of which I never even attended
* I co-developed several popular plugins, one of which 
for a time provided the default mobile experience on WordPress.com.  Several plugin contributors on X (including the author of WPGraphQL) recently told me that my plugin code was their first real introduction
to the WordPress plugin ecosystem, and that they learned a lot from it. That's was a huge compliment to me that I loved to hear.
* I did the first few iterations of the profiles.wordpress.org site, the first on bbPress, and the second on BuddyPress

As such, I'm saddened by what has been taking place and what's apparently happened to WordPress, primarily through the actions of its apparently not-so-benevolent 
dictator. 

It's clear we have all come to a very visible fork 
in the road, one which may ultimately lead in other directions within WordPress, and for some people, outside of it.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if one or more 
forks emerge shortly, along with other plugin/theme repositories and third party update servers.  While I still intend to do what I can to help
the WordPress community recover from the current fracturing, I'm also no longer motivated to keep promoting or using WordPress. 

And that's why for the first time since 2006, this website no longer runs WordPress.
