I took a quick break this afternoon from work and decided to hash out a quick Wordpress plugin that would push my blog entries into my Twitter feed. The end result is [WordTwit](http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordtwit), and it's available for download if anyone wants to try it on their Wordpress blog.

Drop me a comment or two and let me know what you think.
