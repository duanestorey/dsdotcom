I religiously watched the cartoon show every afternoon after school, I owned about 50% of all the toys (which I stupidly sold for about $50 one summer to fund my arcade game playing). Now, there's a new movie coming to the big screen about these guys -- I hope it doesn't suck too bad.

Here's a little teaser trailer for it:
