Throughout my life, I have always had a hard time sleeping in the evenings. Although in the odd instance I can put my head on the pillow and wake up in the morning refreshed, most evenings I not only have trouble falling asleep, I have a hard time staying asleep.

While I have gotten used to not sleeping very well (during the eight years I was in university staying up late and getting up early was a requirement), this week has been particularly difficult for some reason. On average I think I've had about three hours of sleep an evening, and I find myself running completely on fumes during the days. I've dropped my caffeine intake to try and counter it, but it's not making much of a difference. Last night I took a mild sedative to try and help, but it was like throwing paper into the wind. Needless to say I'm going to do my best to sleep in this weekend and get my sleep schedule back on course.

In other news, [it was just announced that Heath Ledger's death](http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/02/06/heath.ledger/index.html) was accidental, the result of combining several prescription medications together. It's pretty sad so many media outlets and shows (Entertainment Tonight almost shot themselves in the head last week by attempting to air a video that they were hoping would make Heath look like a drug user - but Hollywood nearly boycotted the show for doing so) basically assumed he ODed on non-prescription drugs.

It was just a tragic accident, the result of some guy simply trying to get some sleep.
