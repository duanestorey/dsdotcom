We've finally managed to pull the shrink-wrap off of the official WordCamp Whistler website, and launch it to the world. So [head on over and take a look](http://www.wordcampwhistler.com/).

The event will officially take place on January 24, 2009 at the luxurious Fairmont Chateau Whistler in the Whistler village. It's an awesome venue, and we're hoping to make this an event that everyone will really enjoy. We've secured [Lorelle Van Fossen](http://lorelle.wordpress.com) as our keynote speaker, and we're all really excited that she's making the trek up from Portland for our event.

We think this is going to be really great WordCamp, and are looking forward to having it in such a picturesque setting. Tickets for the event are $35, and available on the [EventBrite](http://wordcampwhistler.eventbrite.com) page. We're also accepting corporate sponsorship for the event, so if you're a company that's interested in being a part of WordCamp Whistler, please head on over to [the sponsorship page](http://www.wordcampwhistler.com/sponsorship/) and take a look at our sponsorship packages.

I want to thank [Rebecca Bollwitt](http://miss604.com) and [John Bollwitt](http://www.johnbollwitt.com) for all the hard work they've put in so far. We're all committed to making this a really awesome event, and are hoping to have some really great WordPress related talks. I hope to see the majority of Vancouver's WordPress community at the event!
