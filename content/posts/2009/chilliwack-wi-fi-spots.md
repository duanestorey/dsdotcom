Well, given that [Rebecca](http://www.miss604.com) has Surrey covered in terms of blogging, I might as well take the reins here with Chilliwack. I've spent most of my time here at home since I moved back, but I'm going to start venturing out more and more.

I've been keeping my eye out for Wi-Fi spots in town, and wanted to present a list for anyone ever looking for where they are. I'll keep updating this post over time as Chilliwack slowly emerges from the dark ages.

I have a hard time going to a Chilliwack pub and pulling out my laptop, which is why I have yet to test the Wi-Fi at Major Leagues. It's sort of normal in Vancouver to be in a pub having a beer and computing, but out here, not so much. But the Java hut is a pretty nice spot, and they have a cool gas fireplace I usually plop myself next to.
