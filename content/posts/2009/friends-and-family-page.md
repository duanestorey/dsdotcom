One of the things we've done with WPtouch for a while is to include a Friends and Family page for all the people who have donated to the project. To that end, I wanted to start recognizing companies that have helped me out for travel and events by either comping me items or giving me great deals on things like meals, drinks and/or accommodations. With that in mind, I've started putting together a duanestorey.com [Friends and Family](http://www.migratorynerd.com/about/friends-family/) section that will permanently be on this site. I'm sure I still have lots of entries to add, but I've added the first few to that page.

Big thanks for all the help from the various companies.
