Everyone keeps asking me if there's going to be another WordCamp Whistler this year. Unfortunately the answer is no (at least for the January - March period), not because there's not enough interest (in fact, many people approached me during the social last year and said what a great time they had, and how they wanted to do it again), but because the 2010 Olympics are happening around the same time, and the logistics of that event will basically make it impossible to pull off this year.

So while I make no promises, perhaps there will be a late 2010 version or and early 2011 version of WordCamp Whistler again if there's interest. If you would be interested in that, then drop a line here. If there's enough interest, I'll try to rally the crew and see if we can pull something off.
