Don't have much time this morning, but I wanted to give a quick update. First off, I had a shower before I went to bed last night. Unfortunately, I left the floor a little bit wet, something I realized at around 4am when I went to the bathroom and complete wiped out. Somehow I busted my hand open trying to stop myself from falling, and I bruised my shoulder pretty bad. I woke up with dried blood on my hand this morning, so I must have whacked it pretty good.

This is my sixth last day of work, and then I'm done. I haven't even begun to think about packing yet, and probably won't get a chance to until late next week. WordCamp Whistler is trucking along at a decent pace, and hopefully everyone is coming up. There is only one day left of early bird tickets for WordCamp Whistler, so make sure you [grab your tickets today](http://tinyurl.com/9dv9q8).
