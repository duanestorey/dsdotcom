Today is my mom's 55th birthday, although she doesn't look a day past 30! Last night we gathered over at her place for some prime rib and to sit around and have a few drinks.

When I gave my mom a hug at the end of the night she told me it's been about 10 years since I've been able to make it to her birthday, something that hadn't even crossed my mind until she had said it. But definitely one of the nice things about being back home is that attending family events like birthdays will be a whole lot easier for me.

So have a great day today mom, and enjoy your birthday!
