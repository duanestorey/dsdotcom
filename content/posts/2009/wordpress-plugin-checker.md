We whipped together a little script to scan the WordPress plugin repository for common errors. You can check out the end result [here](http://plugincheck.bravenewcode.com/). Hopefully plugin developers can use it as a resource to improve plugins and let them be used by a wider audience. If you click the link and it doesn't work, try again in a bit -- I've been having a few server problems today.
