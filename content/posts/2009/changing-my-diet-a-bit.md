With regards to my post from yesterday regarding c. diff. First, I want to thank my mom for the eighty or so phone calls and emails she's sent me regarding the subject since that blog entry went up: thanks for caring, mom. Don't worry, I'm ok.

Second, I've decided to change my diet in the short term to see if I can find a food trigger. Pretty much the only time I've felt normal again for a period of time was actually when I was in Cancun in March. For basically a whole week, my stomach problems went away and I felt pretty much 100% for a while.

I spent about 30 minutes today making a mental list of probable causes. Sure, it could be stress, but it's pretty hard to stress me out so I don't think it's that. In terms of diet, what I ate in Cancun was pretty much radically different than what I'd eat at home here. First, I hardly had any coffee and/or cream in Cancun. Not because I didn't want to, but because it just wasn't around very often. Second, I ate a lot more fruits and vegetables down in Cancun, something I haven't had a lot of around the house recently (my nutrition level is basically inversely proportional to how busy I am with work). Third, I drank less soda/pop down in Cancun (but really, not that much -- I was drinking rum and diet coke down there mostly, and was sipping on diet coke as well from time to time). What wasn't available down there though was Splenda (aka sucralose), and I was forced to use real sugar most of the time.

So while I'd normally be tempted to play with a few variables to see what the offender is, for now I'm going to change two items at once, and worry about which one it was later (assuming it helps). I'm going to take a break from all carbonated beverages for a while, and also from Splenda. If that helps, I'll tweak things a bit to see if I can figure out which one it is, and if it doesn't, I'll scratch a few items off the list.
