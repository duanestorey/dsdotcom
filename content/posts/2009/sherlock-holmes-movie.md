![Sherlock Holmes](images/sherlock-holmes-robert-downey-poster.jpg)I just got back from watching Sherlock Holmes with my dad here in Chilliwack. Strangely enough, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie in the theatre, let alone a movie in the Chilliwack theatre. In true retro style, the Chilliwack theatre has yet to discover the true beauty that is cup-holders, but no matter.

I really had no expectations with regards to the movie, but found that I really enjoyed it. I find it a little implausible that Sherlock appears to be a bit of a martial artist, but I guess you can't be a hero nowadays without knowing a bit of kung-fu or karate. Truthfully, there were some really awesome parts of the movie, mainly to do with Sherlock's deductive reasoning and some of the camera angles.

I didn't realize Rachel McAdams was in the movie, so that was a pleasant surprise. They also set the movie up for a sequel, which I think is pretty awesome. Truthfully, I liked this Sherlock Holmes movie far more than the last Bond movie, so I hope they make a few more. If you've seen it, let me know what you think.
