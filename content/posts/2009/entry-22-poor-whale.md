I posted a photo of a cruise ship this morning surrounded by the mountains:

I was just reading the news though, and apparently [that very same ship ended up killing a baby whale](http://www.vancouversun.com/travel/Cruise+ship+impales+baby+whale+docks+Vancouver+port/1829102/story.html):

> What appears to be a baby minke or fin whale has been impaled and killed on a cruise ship that docked in Vancouver Saturday morning.
> 
> The whale, about 20 metres long, was wrapped around the bow of the ship in full view of tourists at Canada Place.
> 
> A worker from the cruise ship, who didn’t want to be named, said he was not sure when the whale had been hit. The boat — the Sapphire Princess — had come in from Alaska on the Inside Passage, he said.
> 
> “From what I hear there was a bit of a rumbling this morning,” he said. “It’s too bad; I wish we had some system to detect them.

John Biehler actually got a good shot of the whale being pulled off the ship:
