Not a good idea. I had some of the craziest dreams I've had in a long time last night.

Back in the day I used to work at McDonalds. I remember one time I went to take the garbage out and hucked a big green bag full into the compactor into the back. Part of it missed and the bag exploded over the concrete. Since I was only making $5/hour, I didn't really care.

A few hours later I came out and looked at some of the stuff that had landed on the concrete. Where a few McChicken used to be was now a big puddle of chicken juice. So, I don't know much, but I'm pretty sure normal chicken doesn't melt out in the sun. So whatever a McChicken is, it does fairly well in the melting department.
