I just heard this on the news, and it's the kind of thing that makes my blood boil. [The Hastings Racetrack is being forced to close](http://www.news1130.com/more.jsp?content=20090309_183842_6652) for a month during the Olympics due to security concerns by VANOC. Lots of employees will be out of work, and some may even lose their jobs.

Given the Olympics are supposed to help the economy, it's rather ironic that VANOC is forcing some people out of work. Shouldn't the rights of the individual business owners be respected, regardless of what VANOC wants?
