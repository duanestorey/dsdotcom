Heading to the beach in a sec, but wanted to do a quick entry. So far I'm having lots of fun down here. This is easily the nicest resort I've ever been at, and the food has been pretty stellar. I was a tad hungover yesterday, more so because of the heat and lack of water than the beer, so I took it easy. Today is a pool day at one of our sister resorts, Coba. So I'm just going to read and relax.

Tomorrow we're heading to [Chichen Itza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen_Itza), which is one of the seven wonders of the world. So I'm definitely looking forward to that. I haven't pulled out my SLR yet, and have been using my little powershot instead. So tomorrow will be a good opportunity to take out my SLR and maybe even try a HDR or too.
