I'm updating WordTwit right now to be able to show responses to Tweets in a blog post. A use case for this would be someone asking a question on Twitter related to a particular blog post, and wanting to incorporate Twitter feedback to that question into a post. Hopefully in a few minutes you'll start to see some tweets show up here.
