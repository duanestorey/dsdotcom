This is pretty stupid. The US government sanctioned the flight of a low-flying 747 over New York city the other day. Obviously seeing a large commercial airliner flying low over New York City set a lot of people into a panic. For whatever reason, that flight was deemed somewhat classified so nobody could tell the people living in New York City about it.
