For whatever reason, I didn't end up falling asleep until around 4am last night. Obviously waking up this morning after about four hours of sleep was pretty crappy. I'm out of cream at home so I meandered my way down to one of my two favorite coffee shops and set up shop.

Unfortunately, I forgot my wallet and my cell phone at home (at least I'm hoping my wallet is at home). Thankfully I had a few bucks worth of change in my pocket so I could order a coffee. The problem with lack of sleep is that it typically forces me into a caffeine cycle. Basically I wake up tired, so I have lots of coffee, then at night I can't sleep, and the next day I'm tired again. So I'm basically going to drink water for the rest of the day and try to break the cycle over the next few days. I might try to hit the gym tonight again, since I haven't really gone in about a week. Pretty hard to go to the gym when you're beat though.
