Other than the two days I spent down in Oregon a while ago, I really haven't taken any time off this summer. Truthfully, I'm a bit bagged to be honest. We had a couple big projects on the go there, and thankfully they're pretty much done at this point. I'll be doing up a posting on BraveNewCode next week talking a bit about some of the recent things we've been involved in.

In the meantime though I'm shutting everything off that beeps or glows and going to enjoy this weekend reading books and watching movies. Anything that doesn't involve typing.
