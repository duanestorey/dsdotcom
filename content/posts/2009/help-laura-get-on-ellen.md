Ellen Degeneres recently signed up on Twitter and somehow managed to get 100,000 twitter followers in a relatively short amount of time. She's fairly new to Twitter, and a few people think she might need a bit of help.

[Laura Roeder](http://twitter.com/lkr) is hoping that Ellen will bring her onto the show to try to learn a few things about using Twitter. I've exchanged a few emails with Laura with regards to WordPress and WordCamp over the past few months, and think it's a pretty cool attempt by her to get on national TV. So I thought I'd give her a hand by blogging her video on YouTube.

Good luck Laura!
