This morning I was thinking about Blogathon while hopping in the shower, and I had that image in my head of the joker from The Dark Knight saying "And Here.... We... Go... "

In less than 48 hours Blogathon 2009 will officially kick off. Some people will be down at WorkSpace in Vancouver hanging out, and others will be congregating in the Valley somewhere. I still haven't decided where I'll end up, although I'm leaning towards the WorkSpace route, as it would be nice to hang out with some friends for the day, and cross the finish line as a group. Free Ice Cream is pretty rad too, so.

There are currently 200 blogs registered for the event, and so far pledges/donations are sitting at close to the $20,000 mark, which is obviously awesome. Considering every person will be generating 48 blog entries within the next 72 hour period, that means there will approximately 9,600 new blog postings by the end of the weekend, all in the spirit of Blogathon. If donations carry on at the current pace, I suspect the total amount raised for charity over the course of the weekend will approach $100,000, a staggering amount, considering it's being raised in a 24 hour period by a group of people sitting at their computers.

I am currently sitting at $160 raised so far, and my goal is currently $1,000. So basically I'm 16% of the way towards my goal. Thanks to everyone who has donated so far -- if you'd like to donate towards the charity of my choice, the [BC Children's Hospital Foundation](http://www.bcchf.ca/main/index.php), then [please do so here](http://www.canadahelps.org/GivingPages/GivingPage.aspx?gpID=4875) (if you get an error, simply go to the web page again -- the website is a bit strange that way).

I haven't done a single bit of prep-work for the event, which means right now I'm coming up with all 48 blog completely from scratch. While I'm a decent enough writer, I think I'm in for a world of hurt if I don't spend at least some time coming up with blog concepts. To that end, I'd like to solicit the help of my readers. If you run across any article you think would be interesting for me to write about, please email it to me at blogathon (at) duanestorey (dot) com. It can be funny, it can be sad, mostly it just has to be interesting, and I'll try to put a spin on it.

I'm looking forward to the event on Saturday, and one again, want to thank everyone who is planning on following along, and for those of you who have already donated.
