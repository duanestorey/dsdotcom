Peter Jackson's next film is "The Lovely Bones", based on the novel with the same name.

Other than that, I don't really know that much. But given how much I liked Lord of the Rings, I'm anxious to see how Peter Jackson does with a new film. Truthfully, I thought his King Kong remake was a little weak.
