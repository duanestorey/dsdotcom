I'm trying to include some stats in my WordCamp Portland presentation. I was hoping everyone who reads this might be able to answer a few questions (please only vote for the topics that are relevant to you):

\[poll id="16"\]

\[poll id="17"\]

\[poll id="18"\]

\[poll id="19"\]

\[poll id="20"\]

Based on the results from this, I might ask a few more questions. Thanks everyone.
