I wrote a blog entry a few weeks ago where I toyed with the idea of maybe doing some traveling in the next year or so. While sitting on the couch here today watching movies, I started thinking about that idea more and more.

The reality is that I can work from anywhere. All I need is a backpack with some clothes in it and my trusty MacBook Pro, and there's really no reason why I couldn't work from any little coffee shop I encounter. Now that my car and student loans are mostly paid off, my monthly expenses have dropped significantly.

In an ideal world, I'd be able to rent my apartment out furnished and go on a working vacation for a few months. Unfortunately, I suspect that renting a furnished apartment isn't very appealing out in the country here, as you don't really get a lot of business travelers where that makes sense. But given how my lease is up in January, I could simply move my stuff into a local storage facility here for a while.

It's something I've always wanted to do to be honest, and it seems like the opportunity is sitting right there in front of me waiting to be grabbed. I remember reading how [Darren and his wife](http://www.darrenbarefoot.com) went to Malta for a while, and that seems like a pretty cool adventure.

I've been telling my friend in Serbia I was going to visit him for years now, so it's definitely a place I'd like to end up, especially during the summer and Exit Festival. Also, I bought a book on Montenegro last year, and it's a place I'd like to visit as well. If anyone has any great ideas for somewhere to go that has a cheap cost of living and reliable internet access, please drop me a line.
