It's a long weekend here in Canada, and I really had no plans. Originally, Rebecca, John and I were gonna go camping, but weather dictates that that's no longer an option. Rebecca and John decided to come hang out for the weekend, which is obviously awesome, since I don't get to hang out with them as much anymore.
