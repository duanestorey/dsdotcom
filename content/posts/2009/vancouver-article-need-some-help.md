I've been asked to write an article for a European magazine about Vancouver. I'm keeping my particular angle under wraps until everything is completely done, but I'd like to solicit some help from my readers. In fact, I'm hoping I can use a few of these quotations in the article, along with possibly a photo or two of some of the people who quoted them.

So, in one or two sentences, please feel free to answer any of the following:

1. What do you like the most about Vancouver?
2. What is your least favourite thing about this city?
3. What is your best memory from living in the city?
4. Do you think Vancouver does enough to help the less fortunate members of the community?
5. How do you feel about the 2010 Olympics, and what do you think the impact will be on the city?
6. Who are some of your favourite local bands?
7. What does Vancouver mean to you?

Also, feel free to ramble, and I'll try to make sense of it.
