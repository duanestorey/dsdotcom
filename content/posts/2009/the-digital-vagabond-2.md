As I've mentioned in previous posts, I've seriously been considering doing a bit of travel. Part of that is complicated by my desire (at some level at least) to purchase an apartment sometime soon. I met with a realtor today to go over some listings in the area, and am slowly transitioning from passive looking into active looking. I'm really not sure of my timeline yet if I were to buy something, but probably sometime in the next 3 to 6 months.

I'm also seriously debating heading to Serbia for a few months in the spring or summer. My friend Milan lives in a little town called Novi Sad, and he's been trying to get me to come visit for quite a while now. I actually was about 3 hours away from getting on a plane to go visit Novi Sad when my previous job canceled my trip on me (which sucked, because I was already packed and ready to go). Every person who has visited Novi Sad or Belgrade has fallen in love with it, and I'm really anxious to visit that part of the world. One of the directors of our previous company went over there for a week for business, and ended up liking it so much that he packed his family up when he got back home and took them there for their holidays.

One of the major benefits of that part of the world is the cost of living. A nice one bedroom apartment will run you around $300 a month, and many of the pubs have beer and wine for around $1. My friend Milan has offered me a place to stay and an office to work at during the days, so it's pretty sweet deal. In addition, pretty much the best concert in Europe happens in Novi Sad in the summer. It's called [Exit Fest](http://eng.exitfest.org/), and it's held in an ancient castle.

So anyways, I'll know more in a few months. But it would be kind of cool to spend a bit of time in Serbia this spring or summer.
