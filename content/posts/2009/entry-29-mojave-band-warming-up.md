Mojave band is here doing a photo shoot right now. Once they're done they're going to be playing a few songs for us, which will totally be cool. Paul is actually a web designer too, and we almost had an opportunity to work with each other a few months ago. But we still hang out from time to time at coffee shops whenever I'm in town:

I'll take some photos during their set and post a few online. But I recently bought Mojave's new CD from iTunes, and it's a great listen, so make sure you pick it up.
