Just a quick question to the photography crowd out there. Does anyone have any experience selling photos on microstock websites? A couple of people have asked me if I've ever put any photographs on microstock sites. I haven't, mainly because I feel pretty strange selling photos for 50 cents each. Truthfully though, most of my photos sit there collecting dust anyways and don't make any money, so I was just curious if there's enough volume on those sites to turn over any non-trivial cash-flow.

Drop a comment if you have any idea. Thanks.
