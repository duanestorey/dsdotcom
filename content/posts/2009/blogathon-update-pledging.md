I've been approved on the official Blogathon website, which means people can actually start pledging for me now. Strangely enough, I've already received about $80 in pledges, several of which came in before I was approved on the website. They appear to be legit, but I can't for the life of me figure out where they came from.

But anyways, as I've pointed out in previous postings, I'll be supporting the BC Children's Hospital on July 25th. So if you'd like to support my efforts and the children at BC Children's Hospital, then please consider [pledging](http://www.blogathon.org/pledge.php?blogid=156). Thanks for the support!
