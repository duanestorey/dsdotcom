I posted this a long time ago on another site, but stumbled across it tonight and thought I'd post it again. It's a short film that was based on a recording of John Lennon made by 14 year old Jerry Levitan in Toronto. Jerry was a huge fan of the Beatles, particularly Lennon, and managed to sneak into the hotel to interview him about world issues. Since being released in 2007, it has been nominated for several awards, including an Oscar.
