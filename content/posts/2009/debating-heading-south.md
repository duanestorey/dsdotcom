So yesterday I was sitting on my patio trying to figure out when to take a vacation. I still have a few small client-related items to finish off, so I've been waiting around for that. While going over everything in my head though I remembered that because I work from a laptop, there's really no reason why I can't work remotely. All I need is an internet connection once and a while to check email, and I'm basically golden.

With that in mind, I'm thinking about testing my Nexus pass out in the next few days and heading south. Pretty much every KOA nowadays has free Wi-Fi, so I could easily do a bunch of work while camping on the coast. Given that I have some friends in Seattle and Portland, I'm debating loading my camping stuff and a guitar in the car and leisurely making my way down to Oregon, camping along the way and doing some work next to various KOA pools.

It's only about a three hour drive from my place to a little KOA south of Seattle, so that would probably be my first stop. I've always wanted to see Mount St. Helens as well, so I definitely want to check that out on my way to Portland.

I'm still toying everything over in my head, but so far I think that's what I might do. I'll probably wait another day or two to wrap a few more things up on my end and figure out who will water my plants, but after that I'd like to hit the road and have a bit of relaxation time.
