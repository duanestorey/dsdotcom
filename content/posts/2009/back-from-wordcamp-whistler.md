As I'm pretty beat, I'll post in more detail about WordCamp Whistler over the next few days. But I wanted to just say that it was a really great success in my opinion, and for the most part, went off without any hitches. I want to thank [John Bollwitt](http://www.johnbollwitt.com) and [Rebecca Bollwitt](http://www.miss604.com) for all their hard work over the last two months to help make it possible. I also want to thank all of the sponsors, speakers, and of course, the attendees who came up and made it a success.

We were hoping that at least 50 people would ultimately show up. The official turn out was somewhere around 105 people, which was really awesome. I was approached by various people over the course of the weekend and told how great it was to have a conference of this nature in Whistler.

It's going to take me a few days to came down off the WordCamp Whistler high, but I just wanted to give an update for everyone who was following along. Hopefully we'll be able to put another event on next year as well, as it really turned out better than I could have expected.
