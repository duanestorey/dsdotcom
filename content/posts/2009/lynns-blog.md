![Lynn](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/155/404402328_c8fa056be7.jpg?v=0)Turns out that my friend Lynn down in Seattle has had a blog for years and years, but for some reason I never knew about it until recently. It's actually a really good read, with quite a few personal entries as well. So if you're looking for some new reading material, definitely head on over and check it out. She'll probably kill me for posting this, but I like living dangerously, so.

Lynn was nice enough to send me some fruit flowers for my birthday years ago, and even though I'm not in Seattle very often we've kept in touch online (which is challenging, considering she doesn't use Facebook or MySpace). The last time I hung out with Lynn we did pretty well in the liquor department, which is always a good time.

You can read about Lynn's life over at the [Lair of the Curmdgette](http://naffoff.blogspot.com/). Maybe one of these days she'll take a break from blogging and finally get her butt up to BC for a visit!
