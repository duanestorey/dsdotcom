...has been announced, and it'll take place on August 28th. Make sure [you come out](http://vancouvertweetup.com/events/the-come-hang-out-with-duane) and meet all your fellow Twitter users in the Vancouver area. The event will be at the Two Parrots pub, which (in my humble opinion) has some of the best nachos in the city.

There will probably be a John Biehler endorsed photo walk afterwards for those of you without compact cameras that want to learn more about taking photos in the dark.
