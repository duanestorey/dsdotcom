I'm currently sitting in the Starbucks near my place, slowly hacking together what will eventually be my slideshow for WordCamp Portland. Truthfully, I'm a bit nervous about this presentation. While I've spoken at a few conferences here and there, most of my presentations were around the 20 - 30 minute mark. This time around, I have a full hour slot to fill, and crafting an hour-long presentation that doesn't completely suck is a rather delicate procedure. I'll be talking mostly about mobile blogging, both from a content producer and a content consumer perspective.

The good news is that apparently there's a big ice-cream pig out immediately preceding my presentation. I'm hoping that means everyone will be super happy and in a state of pure bliss.

I'll be driving down to Bellingham next Friday, and hoping on a plane. I have a slight lay-over in Seattle, finally reaching Portland just in time for the speakers and sponsors dinner on Friday night. WordCamp Portland is a two day event, so there will be a lot of great WordPress information being presented. I'm scheduled to fly back late Sunday night, and will probably be back in my bed sometime around 1am or so that night.

I'll post my slides over on BraveNewCode and here after the presentation. Until then, I have a lot of work and research still left to do.
