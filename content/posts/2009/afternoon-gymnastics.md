One of the best parts about living in Chilliwack is finally being able to hang out with my niece and nephew once and a while. I managed to make it down to Jessica's gymnastics performance this afternoon, which was cool.

I also snagged a pretty cute shot of a little **Jelly Bean** girl waiting to start rolling her ball.
