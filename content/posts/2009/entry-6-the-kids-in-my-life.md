While I don't have any kids of my own, what I do have are a really great niece and nephew that I love very much:

Despite not really spending much time with them over the last ten years (mostly because I lived in a different city), I'm actually fairly close to both of them, and have really been enjoying my time with them since moving back to Chilliwack. Last night my niece gave me a phone call and told me about all of the boy crushes she had while at summer camp (count 'em people, 11 boy crushes).

So this post is dedicated to all the kids in everyone's lives, and how special they all are. Feel free to post a link to any photos of your kids, or to drop a comment about how special the little ones are in your life.
