All my stitches are out. This is day five after surgery now. All the areas are a bit red, but they're healing. Was nice to take a real shower today and also shave.

It generally takes about 6 months for surgery sites to finish healing, so I still have lots of healing to do. A little bit of trivia - after 7 days, surgery sites only have about 7% of the tensile strength of normal skin. So still have to be careful for a while.
