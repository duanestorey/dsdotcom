As [Matt recently indicated](http://ma.tt/2009/05/wordcamp-developer-day/#comments), there will be a developer day on the Sunday after WordCamp San Francisco down at the Automattic offices on Pier 38. Should be a good time -- I'm looking forward to meeting some other developers. Hopefully the hangover won't be too bad that day.

Unlike last year, I actually scheduled a bit of breathing room this trip, so I'll have time to check out the event and also catch a few sights in the Bay Area.
