I was wondering why the term "happy star wars day" was trending on Twitter. Apparently today (May 4th) is, believe it or not, [Star Wars Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day). It's called that because of the play on words with "May the force be with you". Since today is May 4th, people say "May the 4th be with you".

So, happy Star Wars Day everyone!

May the 4th be with you. Always.
