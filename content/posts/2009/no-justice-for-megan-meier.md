![Megan Meier](images/46984939.jpg)I wrote an article last year about a girl named Megan who [committed suicide after a boy named Josh on MySpace](http://www.migratorynerd.com/2008/11/the-world-will-be-better-off-without-you/) told her that the world would be better off without her. The tragic element of that tale is that there was never a boy named Josh - it was always a fake person, invented by a friend of Megan's and Lori Drew, that girl's mother.

The two of them together gained Megan's confidence on MySpace, and then proceeded to toss insults at her, eventually leading directly to Megan wrapping some rope around her neck and hanging herself to death. Despite a previous jury ruling that Lori Drew was guilty, today a judge [reversed the decision](http://www.ktla.com/news/landing/ktla-myspace-suicide,0,1166066.story), and passed a full acquittal.

There's lots I could say right now, but I really don't have the heart. Maybe in the legal world Lori Drew deserves to be acquitted, but that doesn't change the fact that a 13 year old girl is now dead. She'll never get to attend her high-school prom, or to kiss another boy. She'll never graduate from college, and she'll never know the absolute delight of getting those braces off.

The world sure isn't fair sometimes.
