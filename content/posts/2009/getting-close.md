As you can see, things have changed around here a bit. I actually still have quite a bit left to do on this theme, but it's functional enough that I put it live. I'm going to do a custom template for the upcoming Blogathon event, and also flesh out the content in a few more areas. But it's definitely getting close. Thanks to Dale for his help with this too.
