I haven't really had much to say on here in a while. Other than maybe a camping trip this weekend, and WordCamp San Francisco at the end of the month, the next six weeks or so are pretty booked up solid with some client projects. After that I'm going to take a bit of a break for the summer and do some camping or maybe even head over to Europe to visit some friends.

So on that note, I'm going to take a break from traditional blog posts and do a week or so worth of photo entries. Comment if you like, don't comment if you like :) But enjoy!
