Today is day #13 down here in the Caribbean, and I noticed that the date was December 1st this morning. I gotta say, it's pretty hard to take December seriously when the humidex is 40C and there's not a cloud in the sky. This is probably the first December where I've ever been away on vacation, and it's a bit surreal to be honest.

After two weeks here, my clothes are starting to smell a bit like ass. I was hoping to use the laundry service here (where they pick stuff up in your room and bring it back, hopefully within a few days), but I just didn't trust it enough. So today I filled the bathtub up with some water and soap and tried washing a few shirts so I'd have something clean to wear for the next few days.

Dale and I are going to go for a nice steak dinner tonight, and then tomorrow will most likely be another day split between the pool and computing in the lobby. Tomorrow night I'll pack all my stuff up in my suitcase and get ready to head back home. I leave around 11am Thursday morning on the bus which will take me back to the airport. There I'll be meeting up with Rebecca and John who are on the same flight back to Vancouver. My dad is picking me up at the airport around 9:30pm on Thursday, and then him and I will head back to the wack.

Apparently there's free Wi-Fi in the Punta Cana airport, so I'll probably write a quick entry there while waiting for my flight to board (I'll have a 3 hour wait there, so I imagine I'll be absolutely bored). Until then.
