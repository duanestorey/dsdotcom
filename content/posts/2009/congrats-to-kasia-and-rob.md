I'm down here in Punta Cana, drinking a few beers with my friend Dale. I saw on Twitter that my good friend Kasia is expecting her first child, and I wanted to share.

There aren't really too many aspects of my old job I miss, but Kasia is definitely one of them. Despite our best efforts, we haven't been able to meet for lunch or anything since I left my job in January, but hopefully sometime soon. That said, I'm super happy for Kasia and her husband, Rob, on their recent announcement.

I wish you all the best, and I'm sure you're gonna make a kick-ass mom.
