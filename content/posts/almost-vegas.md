Right now, in Las Vegas, is the huge Blog World Expo. Most of the Vancouver tech-scene is down there, including [Rebecca](http://miss604.com), & [Arieanna and Ianiv](http://blogaholics.ca). Last night I decided to head down this morning and join them until Monday morning, since it looked like they were having such a great time. I actually found a pretty decent flight special late last night, and I booked it for this morning.

Unfortunately, when 5am rolled around and I had to get up for the airport this morning, I didn't really feel all that well. Plus, doing six hours worth of plane travel seemed less fun than it did the night before. So anyways, needless to say, I canceled my flight and went back to sleep, waking up shortly before noon.

The good news is that I feel fairly rested today, and am sitting around in my boxers listening to music, making breakfast and drinking coffee. I think I'm just going to stay close to home today and watch some movies. But I almost made it to Las Vegas this weekend, which would have been fun.
