I know everyone is absolutely dying to know the current state of my laptop, so here's an update. I called down this afternoon and they said the LCD is toast on it which is why I've probably been having a pile of problems with sleep and things of that nature. A new one has been ordered and hopefully I can pick it up in a few days. It will be weird having a laptop again as I've gotten fairly used to using my desktop machine at home now.

Also, I'm going to do a blog entry tonight on the end of Heroes season two. Should be awesomely nerdy.
