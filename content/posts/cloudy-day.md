It's cloudy here today, which is a nice change to be honest. While lots of people love summer, I'm not really one of them. Sure, I like sitting on a beach as much as the next person, but I hate being too hot. Fall is probably my favorite season to be honest, since I love walking around with a coffee and taking photos.

I'm off to do a few errands and to find a little coffee shop or something to do some work. Last night when I came back home my car smelt kind of burnt, so I'm not sure if I didn't full disengage the e-brake or if something is up. I'll be paying attention to it this time, so hopefully it's not borked.
