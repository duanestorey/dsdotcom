Yes sports fans, it's 3:46am and yours truly is still wide awake. I've been lying in bed since around midnight try to sleep, but it's just not happening. I caved in and popped a sedative a few minutes ago. I think I have to cut myself off from doing anything on the computer on Sunday nights and just read or watch movies instead. Whenever I get involved in something on my blog or some coding I've been meaning to do, I just have a really hard time turning my brain off when it's time to go to sleep. Maybe I need to lay off the caffeine for a bit as well. Who knows.

Needless to say I'll probably be a bit late getting into work tomorrow.
