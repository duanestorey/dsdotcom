Well, it's been a very busy couple of days. I got a call on Thursday at work from my step-mom telling me that my dad was in the hospital because he had a small heart attack during the night. I left work to go to Chilliwack and be with him in the hospital. He's doing really well, and is mostly just bored now. They're going to take him to New Westminster in the next few days to do an Angiogram and see what he looks like inside. Everyone is confident he's going to make a complete recovery, so that's great. I made several trips to Chilliwack over the weekend to visit him, and just got back an hour ago. I think he was really happy for the amount of support he has gotten over the last few days. People that he hadn't heard from in a while were showing up at the hospital to give their best wishes, to drop off a little basket of fruit or a card.

There's basically nothing to do in the intensive care unit, so mostly we've just been hanging out with him and keeping his spirits up. I went down to Future Shop yesterday and picked out a portable DVD player so that he could watch a movie or two during the night if he couldn't sleep (thanks to Cathy for paying for it). I don't think he's been sleeping very well since he has a blood pressure cuff on that inflates every hour or so during the night, which usually wakes him up.

I'll keep everyone in the loop with how he's doing, but it looks like he's going to be just fine after a few more days.

Other than that, not much else is new. I'm going to head out and return some movies in a second, and maybe grab another one to watch tonight.
