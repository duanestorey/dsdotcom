I've been getting a lot of notices from Air Canada's Aeroplan recently. Apparently they have changed their policy so that air miles accumulated on airlines actually expire after a period of time. What that means is my airmiles from a long time ago are going to start disappearing off my statement in the near future.

So, I guess the easiest way to get around that is to cash them in sometime in the next 6 months and go somewhere. I don't really have a lot of vacation at work, so I'll probably just have to go somewhere for an extended weekend. I have 40,000 miles right now, which will basically get me anywhere in the US (incl. Hawaii), Mexico, and Canada. Any suggestions for where to go in the next 6 months for a weekend trip?
