So tonight was a pre-party drinking adventure at Jason and Sheila's new apartment near Coal Harbour. They moved from near me down to a new place right on the water. There's a good party coming up here on Friday, so it should be a good time.. It will probably be the last big drinking adventure before we're having a few beers at the Westin Waterfront hotel in Boston. I'm actually getting really exciting about going to Boston.. I hate flying, but realizing I'm in a bar on the atlantic ocean at 2am always brings a smile to my face..

I went out today after work and snapped a few shots around Canada Place.
