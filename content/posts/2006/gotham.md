So, yesterday night Cisco and I met up with [Cullen](http://www.dial911anddie.com) at [Gotham](http://www.dinehere.ca/restaurant.asp?r=95) for dinner. Gotham is arguably Vancouver's finest steakhouse, and despite living here for 10 years or so, I had never been there. Steaks start at around $40, and go up to the $50 Porterhouse that I had. Apparently they cook them in some funky infrared chamber that can cook a steak in around 6 minutes. Anyways, it was fun, but I'm not sure my steak was worth $50.

Afterwards, we met up with Jason, Ecker and Derek for a few drinks. It was a fun night, but I wasn't looking forward to the 8am conference call in the morning.

Oh, another exciting piece of information -- in exactly one month I'll be sipping tequila and drinking coronas at the [Gala Beach Resort in Huatulco, Mexico.](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150789-d152279-Reviews-Gala_Beach_Resort_Huatulco-Huatulco_Pacific_Coast.html) So exciting.
