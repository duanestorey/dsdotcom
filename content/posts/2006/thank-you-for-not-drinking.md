Well, the whole no-drinking-for-thirty-days effort came to a crashing halt late last night as Derek, Chris, Alex, Dustin and myself managed to get ourselves pretty wrecked.? It started as a simple "just one drink, it won't kill you," and finished sometime around 4am as I passed out on the couch.? The good news is that I didn't break from low carbing, so I should still be on track.

I think the whole no-drinking effort was fundamentally flawed from the start.? That being said, I'm going to try and limit my drinking during week nights I think.
