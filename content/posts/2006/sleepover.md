Well, on Friday night Cole and Lexi came over for a sleep over. We hung out at my place, and then went down to Granville Cinemas to see Over the Hedge. I have to say, that's the one saving grace for movies these days -- that the animated shows still have heart and soul. I couldn't believe what amazing scenes I was seeing, even though it was completely computer generated. It makes a typical Hollywood look so dismal in comparison. Here's a shot of Lexi hanging out at my place.
