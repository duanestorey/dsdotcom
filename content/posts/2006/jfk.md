For those of you who are history buffs, John F. Kennedy was shot at 12:30 CST on November 22nd, 1963. I once spent a lot of time reading about JFK, years ago.

Also in the news lately is allegedly new evidence into the [assassination of RFK](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/6169006.stm) at the Ambassador Hotel right after the California Primary in 1968. Some info about that assassination is [here](http://homepages.tcp.co.uk/~dlewis/).

In 1976, the House Select Committee on Assassinations undertook an investigation into the deaths of JFK and Martin Luther King Jr. to help put the rest the publics' belief that these assassinations took place as a result of a conspiracy.

> The Final Report of the House Select Committee on Assassinations presents the HSCA's findings in the murders of both President John F. Kennedy and Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. The HSCA found a "probable conspiracy" in the JFK assassination, but was unable to determine its nature or participants (other than that Oswald was still deemed to have fired all the successful shots). In the King case, the HSCA similarly found that James Earl Ray assassinated Reverend King, but that there might have been a small-scale conspiracy involved.

Both JFK and RFK oppossed violence in Vietnam, while Lyndon Johnson (who succeeded Kennedy) dramatically increased the US involvement in the [Vietnam War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War).
