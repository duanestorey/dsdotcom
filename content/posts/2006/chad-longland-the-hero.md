Margo sent me this article about her brother Chad.? I guess him and his girlfriend were hanging out by the Vedder river in Chilliwack when Chad spotted a body floating in the river.? Chad pulled him out and performed CPR on him.

Here's the article in the [Chilliwack Times](http://www.chilliwacktimes.com/issues06/084106/news/084106nn5.html).

Wow to go Chad!
