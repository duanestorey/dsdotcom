Amanda called me last night and asked if I wanted to go to the Vancouver Aquarium with her, Andie and the kids. She had a free ticket, so I thought it would be fun. Traffic was a bitch getting to and from the Aquarium, but we all had fun while we were there. I'm thinking about maybe playing tennis tomorrow, and finally getting around to cleaning up my apartment.
