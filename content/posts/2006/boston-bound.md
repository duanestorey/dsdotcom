I got my flight confirmation today, so I'm officially heading to Boston in a few weeks for fall VON.? The only crimp in a otherwise fun trip is having to fly on September 11th.? For a guy who hates flying to begin with, it's not really an exciting thought.

On Friday night we completed our move into Bentall One.? Adrian was nice enough to blow his whole weekend setting up the network, so today was a fully productive day. ? Other than that, not much else is new -- I hung out with my dad and step-mom on Saturday down in Steveston (mmm fish and chips).? My dad took some good photos, so maybe he'll let me post one here tomorrow.
