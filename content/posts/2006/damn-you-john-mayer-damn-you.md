So, about a month ago I decided that I was going to pull my guitar out of retirement and try to get better at it again. I've been playing for about ten years now, but realistically I only spent about a year or two actively playing it, so I really can't play anything tha complicated. But I decided I'm going to try and get better.

So, I've pulled out all my recent music and have been trying to play it on my guitar. The only problem is most of the stuff I have been listening to is rather tough to play for me on the guitar. Take John Mayer for example. He's a really good guitarist, inspired by greats like Jimi Hendrix. He's really jazzy and bluesy, and his fingers are all over the fretboard most of the time. I have smallish hands, so it's pretty difficult for me to pull out some of the crazy shit he does.

I tried playing this one piece tonight, and my fingers were in some weird twister-like maneuver and I still couldn't get it right. It's a good thing I don't try singing, because that would mess me up even more. I'm determined to play some of his harder stuff though, even if I have to break a few fingers in the process (what's a few more broken bones anyways)?
