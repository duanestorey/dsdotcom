A few days ago, Brennen and Jessica had their first baby. What's sort of interesting is that they had an ultrasound done to find out the baby's sex, and were told it was going to be a boy. So, they got lots of boys clothes, painted the room blue, picked out names, etc. But, at the hospital, they were treated to a baby girl.

I popped by for a while today to see their currently unnamed baby girl. What a cutie.
