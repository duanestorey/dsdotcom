So, on Tuesday, December 5th, 24 Season Five comes out on DVD. I lost a few weeks to my life to the first four seasons, and plan to lose another week to this new season the moment it comes out. I'm pretty excited about it since it's supposed to be a pretty wicked season.

Hopefully they still have a few copies left at Future Shop when I get off of work on Tuesday.
