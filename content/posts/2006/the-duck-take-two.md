Tonight Chris is heading back to the Duck to regain his honour. In case you weren't around to follow the last time he went to the duck, you can [read about it here.](http://www.migratorynerd.com/index.php/archives/65) Needless to say, the Duck outdid the poor guy last time, but this time Chris swears he's going to demolish ten jars of their sludge. Jeff Giddens will be going along for the ride, so it should be a good time. I'm staying out of this one, because drinking ten+ beers doesn't seem like a good way to drop a few pounds in my opinion, but I'll write about it tomorrow.
