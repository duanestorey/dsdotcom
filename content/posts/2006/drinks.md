I went out with Jason, Hesty, Chris and Shiela tonight for a little while.. We bounced between a few bars and checked out some of the Vancouver nightlife.. It was pretty hard to get into most pubs, so we had to settle for a few lesser known places.. We started laying the groundwork for a wicked Canada day pub crawl on Sat. Should be great!

Also, Dustin show me this crazy ass video from a Norweigen band that uses kitchen appliances for their instruments.. This stuff is pretty messed:
