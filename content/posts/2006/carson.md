A few weeks ago, when I was back in Chilliwack for thanksgiving, [I stopped by Cory's house](http://www.migratorynerd.com/index.php/archives/114) to hang out and see his new kid. They just sent me a photo of Carson in his costume for Halloween.

Speaking of Halloween -- Chris and I are constructing our costumes this weekend. I'm pretty pumped.
