So, I figured it was about time for an update, since everyone has been asking how I'm doing. I had a bad episode today. I was sitting on the couch watching TV, when suddenly I felt a sneeze coming on. It really freaked me out, because I knew at that moment just how painful a sneeze would be. I couldn't stop it, and before I knew it my teeth were bashing together from the sneeze, and my whole head was in agony. That happened about three more times, and by the end of it I thought I was going to pass out. Luckily it hasn't happened again.

The swelling in my eye is down quite a bit, so my eye actually looks like an eye again. It was really freaky the first day, because my eye was basically black and swollen so large the skin was almost inverted. It's still pretty black, but some of the areas on the side have gone drained of blood and they're some sickly yellow now.

Moving my eye hurts quite a bit, especially upwards. I'm not really sure why that is.. It could be because part of the muscle is caught in the fracture, or it could just be part of the swelling. I still have no sensation in the lips, gum, and cheek on the left side of my face. On days 1 and 2, the swelling on the left side of my face was really large and gross, but it's starting to come down now. Tomorrow (Friday) I get to finally meet with the plastic surgeon to see what they need to do. My family thinks I'm being paranoid, but I think my left eye is now slightly lower than my right eye, which means they'll have to go in and adjust the bone to make it ok again (think metal plates and screws). Which sucks, but I really want everything done soon so I can get on with my life again. Hopefully the stitches on my face can come out at this point in time too, since they shouldn't be in more than five days. If they do an operation, it should be early next week I hope.

Thanks again for everyone who's been calling and sending emails. Hopefully I'll be back on my feet again in no time. I haven't posted any pics because, well, they're kind of gross. If anyone wants to see just send me an email and I'll show you.
