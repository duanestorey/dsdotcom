Man, I gotta save some money to get a new digital body next year.. These things are getting pretty awesome. Here are some specs:

- 2700 shots, **on a single battery charge!**
- powers on in 0.18 seconds
- 3 frames per second **for up to 100 consecutive shots**
- 10.2 megapixels

Here's a link to some news on it -[news](http://www.livingroom.org.au/photolog/reviews/nikon/nikon_d80.php)
