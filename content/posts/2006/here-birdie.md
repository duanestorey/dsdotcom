Last week, Tiffany invited me out to join her and Hanh for some karaoke down at the (yeah, that's right) the legion. It actually wasn't as bad as I thought, although the beer line was insanely long. Once we figured out how to 'shorten' the line, it was a far better evening. I didn't get up the guts to go sing anything crazy, but maybe next time. Afterwards, Derek and I went to Tiffany's place for an hour or so. Here's a shot of me, right before I ate her budgie. Actually, I think the budgie was giving me a kiss.
