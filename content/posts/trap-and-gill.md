Well, I haven't hung our with my pal [Mel](http://www.2bitstudios.com) in quite a while (actually, I haven't seen her since my birthday). Tonight she invited a pile of people down to the Trap and Gill near my place. I showed up, and definitely drank my share.

It was cool seeing Mel and company again, and I had a great time.

I'll be camping up in Cultus tomorrow with [Rebecca](http://www.miss604.com) and [John](http://www.audihertz.net/blog). If you're close by, bring beer.
