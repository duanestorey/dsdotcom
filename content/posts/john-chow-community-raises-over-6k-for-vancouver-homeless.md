I caught the tail end of John's offer on Twitter, but managed to get a donation in just in time. [John Chow](http://www.johnchow.com) offered to match everyone's donations (up to $1000 per person) towards the [Union Gospel Mission](http://www.ugm.ca) to help provide thanksgiving dinner to the homeless in Vancouver.

For those of you who follow along, [Rebecca Bollwitt](http://www.miss604.com), [Matthew Good](http://www.matthewgood.org) and myself recently sponsored the Union Gospel Mission during Blogathon in Vancouver. It was a really rewarding experience, and it was great helping a Vancouver charity dedicated to improving the lives of those who are less fortunate in this city.

John helped bring his community together, and managed to [raise over $6000 in the last few days](http://www.johnchow.com/613248-to-help-feed-the-hungry-this-thankgiving/), which amounts to thanskgiving dinner for approximately 2,300 people in Vancouver.

Obviously that's an impressive feat, and my hat goes off to John Chow for pulling it together with short notice. Thanks to John and the members of his website, 2,300 people on the streets will be able to have a warm meal on thanksgiving.
