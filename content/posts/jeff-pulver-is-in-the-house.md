[Jeff Pulver](http://www.pulver.com/) is not only one of the original pioneers of voice over IP (VoIP), but also a really great individual who dedicates himself to technology and meeting all the people involved in it. I first met Jeff in the lounge of the Fairmont San Jose where him, Erik Lagerway and myself all sat around drinking one night years ago. If I remember correctly, Jeff picked up the tab that night, so I definitely owe him a few beers.

Jeff will be up in Vancouver on the 10th and 11th of January. If you're around and want to grab breakfast with him on the morning of the 11th, check out [the Facebook event](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=41169664283&ref=mf) he set up.

I'm looking forward to catching up with Jeff again, and for helping contribute to a January 11th hangover for the guy.
