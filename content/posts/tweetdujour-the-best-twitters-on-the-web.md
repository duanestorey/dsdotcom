Over a few beers a few weeks ago at the [AdHack](http://adhack.com) launch party, [Jay Grandin](http://jaygrandin.com) and I started talking about Twitter and thought it would be pretty cool to have some place to showcase all the best tweets from the web. We did a quick domain name check and realized that [TweetDuJour.com](http://www.tweetdujour.com) was available. Since I had my iPhone with me, I quickly purchased it.

After work tonight I decided to finally whip something together really quick for it. We created a user on Twitter called [TDJ](http://twitter.com/tdj) (Tweet Du Jour) and tied its @replies into the TweetDuJour website. We're hoping people who encounter cool Tweet's during the day will retweet then, prefixing the tweet with **@tdj** so that it ends up showing on the TweetDuJour.com site.

Eventually we'll moderate the Tweet Du Jours, but for now we'll allow them all to go through. We think it's a pretty fun idea, and are hoping some people mess around with it and share interesting tweets with everyone else.
