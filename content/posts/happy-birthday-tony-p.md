Today is [Tony Pierce's](http://blog.tonypierce.com/) 104th birthday. Tony's a great guy who has built himself quite the media empire down in LA. The last time I saw Tony, it was at some dimly lit, somewhat seedy strip club in east Hollywood. Prior to that, Tony and I sat in his car in some parking lot, drinking cheap beer out of a brown bag and reminiscing about life. Good times.

Have yourself a good birthday dude, and try not to get into too much trouble.
