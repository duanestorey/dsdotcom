I went into my backpack tonight to look for my good buddy Waddles, but alas he's nowhere to be seen. I've looked everywhere, but I just can't find him :(

So, here's the official wanted poster.

Answers to the name of "Waddles". Last seen in Malta, but visited Rome briefly. Could be anywhere between Sliema, Malta and Novi Sad, Serbia. A handsome reward, in beer, for his discovery.

Thanks.
