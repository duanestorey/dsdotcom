I meant to post this earlier, but I've just been slammed these last few days. Today is a special day, as it's the birthday of two of my good friends.

The first is [Arieanna](http://blogaholics.ca), who I've been lucky enough to get to know a lot better over the course of this last year. The first time I really hung out with her was at the 2008 Canadian Juno Awards in Calgary, where her and I crashed a VIP party and proceeded to drink our weight in beer. Good times.

The second birthday is of course [Keira-anne](http://www.keira-anne.com)'s. One of the first times I ever hung out with Keira was on a little dog walk out in Stanley Park. Having never met her before, I remember being a little nervous for some reason. Since then, we've spent a lot of time hanging out, hitting the beach, and of course, eating nachos and her world famous guacamole.

I'm a lucky guy in that both of these great ladies are my friends. So on this day, I wish you both a very happy birthday!
