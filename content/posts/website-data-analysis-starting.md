Big thanks to all of you who pinged me about helping with my little web experiment. So far we have six hosts represented, but I'd love to have a lot more. So if you have any friends that have blogs and can help out, [please direct them to me](http://www.migratorynerd.com/2008/02/web-hosting-experiment/). I'm collecting data in real time right now, so it will be interesting to see what it'll all look like after a few days.

When this is done, we should all have a pretty intimate insight into all the various hosting companies out there and how they compare to each other during normal wear and tear.

**The teaser is over for now! Stay tuned, in a few days I'll post some detailed results.**
