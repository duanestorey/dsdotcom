Believe it or not, not one but two of my friends are celebrating birthdays today. First, is my good friend Jeff from Chilliwack. We've been friends for a long, long time now.

I actually sort of met Jeff in grade nine math class, when him and I would team up and blow spitballs into Margo's hair instead of doing derivatives. Good times indeed.

And of course, today is also Keira's birthday. I haven't known Keira as long as Jeff, but in the time I've known her she's been a good friend, and she's obviously a great gal -- I wish her the all best for her 27th birthday.

Last night a bunch of us had an impromptu gathering down in Gastown to celebrate:

Happy Birthday guys.. Go out and enjoy the snow today!
