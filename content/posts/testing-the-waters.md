Tonight I had the unusual desire to spend some time working on my blog. The last theme that was up was 100% written by me entirely from scratch. And while I really liked it when it went up, I've grown a bit tired of it. So for now, I'm using the [Balance](http://www.thoughtmechanics.com/2006/04/18/balance-01-alpha-released/) theme from the internet. It has a lot of cool Ajax features, and even supports [Gravatars](http://site.gravatar.com/) in the blog comments. If you don't have a gravatar, I suggest you head on over and get one.

So instead of reinventing the wheel with my own theme, I think my current plan is to spend some time extending this one with some of the cool features I've been thinking of. Also, this theme seems to have broken support of the Crossroads plugin, so I have to do some work on that and get it working again.

If you have any cool ideas or comments, let me know. I'd like to get the blogroll back ASAP, and then clean up a few of the visual things that bug me about this blog. But for now, this is it. Enjoy.

I'm also a bit behind on my blog entries, so I'm gonna try and hammer out a few in the next 24 hours.

Ignore this next part -- this is an image test for Fancy Excerpt.

And now a video test.
