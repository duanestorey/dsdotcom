I picked up a new cell phone the other day -- the Samsung a920. This thing is pretty cool because it has a build in mp3 player, and a 1.3 MP digital camera. The best part is that it's possible to post the photos right from the digital camera into my flickr account, so I can take photos on the fly and have them show up on my blog. Pretty cool if you ask me. Here's a sample shot taken of my desk at work (yeah I know I need to clean it). I haven't figured out how to make it send the original image (it seems to scale it down all the time), but it's a neat feature regardless.
