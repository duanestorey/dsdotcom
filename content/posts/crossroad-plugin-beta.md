I finally cleaned up the main plugin for this website enough that I'm ready to release it to whoever wants to test it out. You can read about it and download it from the [Crossroads Page](http://www.migratorynerd.com/crossroads-plugin/). Basically all the flickr pieces on this website are handled by that plugin, so if you like what you see on this website, then feel free to test it on yours.

I still have a ton of work to do on it, mainly in the speed optimization area, but I figured it's good enough now for some people to test out. Enjoy.
