Given that I'm about to head out on my second round of travel this year, I thought it might be fun to tally a few metric from my travels so far.

First, some quantitative metrics:

- Flight Segments: 15
- Flight Distance: 51,908 (kilometers)
- Total Flight Costs: $4,240
- Total Cost / 100 km: $8.17
- Countries Visited: Six

Next, some qualitative ones from this segment:

- Favourite Experience: [Visiting a penguin rookery](/2011/update-from-the-end-of-the-world/) in Ushuaia, Argentina
- Favourite Restaurant: [Lupita](http://www.lupitaweb.com.ar/), Las Ca√±itas, Buenos Aires, [La Cabrera](http://www.parrillalacabrera.com.ar/) is a close second
- Best Photography: [Iguazu Falls](/2011/weekend-trip-to-iguazu-falls/), on the border of Brazil and Argentina
- Notable Drinking Adventure: Drinking Guinness from a self-pour in Limerick on my birthday

In terms of the next round, I currently have 8 flight segments booked representing 37,000 kilometers at a cost of around $2,200 ($5.94 / 100 km). That will take me from Vancouver to Japan to Thailand to Malaysia to Auckland to Australia and back to Canada.

So in terms of flights, by the end of the year I'll have flown 89,000 kilometers at a cost of $6,480. Given that it represents almost full year of travel, that works out to about $540 a month.

I actually save about $450 a month by not having my car on the road, so that in itself nearly pays for all my flights. I may try playing with an Around The World ticket next year to see if I can save even more money.
