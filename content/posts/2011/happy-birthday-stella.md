As many people know, I spent the last four months bouncing between South America and Europe. It was a fun time, and I met a pile of great people over the course of my trip.

One such person is Stella Maris, who lives just outside of Sao Paulo, Brazil. I was at a random pub in Buenos Aires called "Sugar" when I ran into Stella and her cousin. I was a few sheets to the wind, so I honestly don't remember too much that night, other than meeting up with them. But thankfully I've kept in touch with Stella over the last few months, and it so happens that I can wish her a virtual birthday from afar!

Stella is what we would call in Vancouver "good people", so please drop her a note and wish her a happy birthday if you pass by these parts!

Happy Birthday Stella!
