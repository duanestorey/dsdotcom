So I'm currently at my mom's place looking at her new computer. While checking out her new monitor, she spilled the goods:

Mom: "Hey, you know that blog entry about people getting to your blog by googling duanestorey.com" Me: "Yah" Mom: "Don't tell anyone, but it was us.. That's what we do"

So there you have it. My mom needs a few lessons in how to browse the web. I still love her though. Even though it means I might be adopted.
