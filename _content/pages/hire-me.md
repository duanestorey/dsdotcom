If you’re looking for a talented WordPress developer or strategist with over a decade of real world experience (including building and selling a seven figure WordPress company), then this could be your lucky day.

I have organized three international WordPress conferences, two in Vancouver, Canada, and one in Whistler, Canada. I was the primary developer for the WPtouch mobile plugin, previously voted the #1 plugin for all of WordPress at the primary WordPress event, WordCamp San Francisco. Other projects I’ve worked on include the personal website for Juno-winning musician Matthew Good, WordPress.org’s profile site, Vancouver’s Vision Critical, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, and Rogers Communications Inc.

Prior to working with WordPress, I helped develop the voice and video engine that was used in Yahoo! Messenger and deployed to 80 million end points. For more information about my background and experience, head on over to [Linked-In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duanestorey/).
