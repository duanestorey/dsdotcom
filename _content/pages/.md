One of my favourite outdoor activities for the spring and summer months is outdoor hiking. Over the years I’ve completed several long distance hikes, and plan to continue trying to get one in every year or so. Obviously with COVID19 things are still a bit up in the air, but it’s still nice to work on planning some of the other ones.

## Completed Hikes

- [West Coast Trail](https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/activ/SCO-WCT)– BC, Canada – 75km
- [Camino Frances – Spain (2017) – 800km](/travel/walking-the-camino-de-santiago/)
- [West Highland Way – Scotland (2018) – 154km](/hiking/walking-the-west-highland-way-in-scotland/)
