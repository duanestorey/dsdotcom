This morning I woke up and decided to make some plans. Strangely enough, that line from Shawshank Redemption kept going through my head — “get busy living, or get busy dying. You god damn right.”

Anyways, it also didn’t help matters that [Dave and Lauren](http://mezzoblue.com) took off the other day, as well as [Tanya](http://www.netchick.ca) and [Gus](http://gusdigital.com/2009/07/camping-quick-update/). Even Dale left yesterday to go do some relaxing at a cottage. So Instead of just heading south without a plan (something I’ve done many times before and been burned for), I decided to call a few campgrounds first.

Thankfully the little KOA right outside of Portland had one tenting spot available, so I made a reservation and then started to pack my car. Unfortunately for me, someone was moving in at the time, so I had to carry about six loads of camping gear down four flights of stairs to my car. It was actually pretty tiring. Afterwards I swung by my sister’s house and left her my keys, hoping that she’ll somehow make it over there every few days or so to water my plants.

I’m currently in Cascade Locks, Oregon hanging out on a little patio at the campground here. I have six beer waiting for me back at my tent, along with some chips and some firewood. So, I’m just going to have a chill night by the fire, and wait until the morning to think about what I’m going to do while I’m down here.
