I read an article this morning that made mention of QR codes, and to be honest, I had never heard of them before. After doing some research, it appears that [QR codes are essentially two-dimensional bar-codes that are fairly popular in Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code). A user with a camera phone can simply point their phone at a QR code and, assuming it is QR code aware, will decode the symbol.

QR codes can be used to encode URLs, phone numbers, text information, and SMS messages. So you can have an advertisement and simply put your URL as a QR code. A user passing by could simply hold their camera in front of the code, and it would grab the URL address, all without any typing. It’s interesting that QR codes actually have a primitive form of error correction in them, so small changes in the look will generally still be decoded properly.

Here’s a quick QR code I generated for my website using this [cool QR code generator](http://qrcode.kaywa.com/). If you can decode it, let me know:
