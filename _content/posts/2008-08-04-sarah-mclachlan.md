Blog traffic is pretty low, even by weekend standards. So I can only assume that everyone’s out enjoying the long weekend. I’ll keep this post short for now.

We all had a rather crappy sleep last night, so we’re a bit tired. We went down to the main stage early in the morning and managed to catch a few artists doing sound check. Here’s a quick shot of Sarah McLachlan.

Here’s a quick video I took of sound check. It’s not finished converting yet, [but head over and take a look](http://blip.tv/file/1145175).
