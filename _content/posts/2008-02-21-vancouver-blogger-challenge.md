So, I didn’t start this challenge, but I gladly played along with it. I just checked, and I”m still in the #1 spot for Vancouver Blogger. The festivities tonight start at 6pm, so I’m assuming that’s when Northern Voice officially starts.

I was sort of expecting someone to fly ahead at the last second, and maybe that will still happen. But unless something major changes or Google does another index, it’s looking pretty good for camp Duane.

Anyone want to concede defeat at this point? 🙂
