A few days ago I started getting a soreness in my throat and lungs that has since progressed into what I figured was bronchitis. I hit the medical clinic in Yaletown tonight and got a full check-up, and sure enough, it’s what I thought it was. They’ve prescribed Zithromax, which should hopefully have me feeling a lot better in a day or two.

After filling my prescription on Pacific, I decided to check out a new coffee shop that opened up there. The coffee shop is Waves Coffee, and it’s a quaint little spot right on the West Side of Yaletown. It reminded me a lot of the coffee shops I used to spend a lot of time at in Kitsilano back when I was a student.

While Waves is definitely comfy looking, they also provide full 24 hour service as well as free wireless internet (as an added bonus, most of the tables are next to power outlets). To be honest, I’m really happy to see something like that opening up around here. While there are certain aspects of the Bay Area that I don’t like, one of the nice things about that area is that you can usually find places that are open 24 hours a day, including coffee shops, gyms, food places, etc. As a somewhat creative person who hates 9-5 (I’m a night owl), it’s sort of nice knowing there’s a place I can go at 2am if I just want to chill, surf the web, or meet up with other night owls.

In addition, I think it’s really great for students in the area, since it’s far more enjoyable to be studying into the wee hours of the morning in a nice, cozy coffee shop as opposed to your bedroom.

So if you’re in the neighbourhood, or looking for somewhere to have a small meeting with friends or co-workers, I highly recommend checking them out. They are at the corner of Drake and Pacific – make sure you tell them you read about them on my blog!
