I may have the opportunity to go to London, UK for a week at the beginning of July. Originally I was going to take a week of holidays next week and go camping in the rockies, but in light of this recent opportunity, I’ve been thinking of postponing my vacation, and using it up in Europe. I have never been to Europe, so I think it would be pretty cool to have a week there.. The question is, what should I do with a week off in Europe, knowing that I’ll be starting in London? I’d like to fly to Paris, and then maybe explore a bit by train. Does anyone have any suggestions?
