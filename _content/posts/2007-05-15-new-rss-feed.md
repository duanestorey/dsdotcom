For those of you that primarily read this blog via my RSS feed, I’d appreciate it if you can update to my new feedburner one. I plan to add some flickr photos to the stream from time to time, as well some goodies from a few other sites.

You can [access the new link here](feed://feeds.feedburner.com/duanestorey?format=xml). I’ll override the old one too at some point when I have time, but it helps if you do this manually for now. Thanks.
