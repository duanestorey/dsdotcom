I just went to get a few groceries, and had this weird feeling my stomach like I was forgetting something. I looked at the time on my iPhone and realized that it was three years ago to the day that I [went through that window in Vancouver](http://www.migratorynerd.com/blog/2006/saturday-night/).

Times flies I guess, as do people.
