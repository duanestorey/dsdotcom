Tomorrow night Tonight there is a Vancouver technology mixer down at the trendy night club Republic on Granville Street. I haven’t been out to one of these in a long time, mainly because I’ve been feeling a bit under the weather for the last few months, but I think I’m going to check it out tomorrow.

Launch Party recently launched a [new website](http://www.launchpartyhq.com/), and if you look very, very closely, you may recognize the header image on it 🙂

So, hopefully I’ll still feel like heading out tomorrow. I will be good to catch up with some old tech friends and see what’s new. Plus, it gives me an excuse to go buy a new shirt or something tomorrow at lunch.
