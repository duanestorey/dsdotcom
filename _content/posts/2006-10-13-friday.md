Ahh, I love Friday. Even though a bunch of people are going into work this weekend (including me), I’m looking forward to a few days of relaxing. I want to check out Departed and Trailer Park Boys the Movie this weekend, so that’s definitely on the list of things to do. I was also invited about to my friend Megan’s birthday party tonight in Yaletown, **along with about 10 single 26 year old girls**. Me. Beers. Cute single girls. Does it get any better?

As for tomorrow, not sure yet. Tiffany was trying to get a bunch of people together to watch UFC, so I might end up doing that.
