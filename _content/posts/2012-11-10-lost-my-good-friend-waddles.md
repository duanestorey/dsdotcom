I went into my backpack tonight to look for my good buddy Waddles, but alas he’s nowhere to be seen. I’ve looked everywhere, but I just can’t find him 🙁

So, here’s the official wanted poster.

One Argentine penguin. Answers to the name of “Waddles”. Last seen in Malta, but visited Rome briefly. Could be anywhere between Sliema, Malta and Novi Sad, Serbia. A handsome reward, in beer, for his discovery.

Thanks.
