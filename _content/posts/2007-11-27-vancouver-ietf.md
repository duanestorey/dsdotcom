For those of you who don’t know, the Internet Engineering Task Force is a group of people that ultimately decide the technologies that will ultimately be engrained into the internet. UDP, TCP, SSL, HTTP – these are all examples of technologies that were originally put through the IETF before becoming standards.

Next week, the [70th IETF meeting](http://www3.ietf.org/meetings/70-IETF.html) will be hosted here in Vancouver. A bunch of people from our company usually participate in the sessions, and I might swing by and check out what’s new and exciting. One of the best parts about meetings like this is that it brings together a bunch of the amazingly bright people in the industry that I usually only see once a year. I believe I’ve even offered my couch to someone during that time, and for sure there will be a few nerdy drinking sessions (assuming I can drink next week).

I’ll probably do a few posts next week as all the activities unfold, and will hopefully snap a few photos from within the IETF, which will probably be down at the Westin on the water I believe.
