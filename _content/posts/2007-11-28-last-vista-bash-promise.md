I just read this while surfing the internet – that in a [comparison of Windows XP SP3 against Vista SP1, XP blew it completely out of the water](http://www.news.com/Windows-XP-outshines-Vista-in-benchmarking-test/2100-1016_3-6220201.html):

> Vista’s first service pack, to be released early next year, is intended to boost the operating system’s performance. However, when Vista with the Service Pack 1 (SP1) beta was put through benchmark testing by researchers at Florida-based software development company Devil Mountain Software, the improvement was not overwhelming, leaving the latest Windows iteration outshined by its predecessor.
> 
> Vista, both with and without SP1, performed notably slower than XP with SP3 in the test, taking over 80 seconds to complete the test, compared to the beta SP3-enhanced XP’s 35 seconds.

80 seconds in Vista. 35 seconds in XP. It can be yours for only $200, plus associated hardware upgrades.

Oh, and while I’m at it, check this out. Do you have a windows box at home that randomly starts playing classical music? Think your ears are playing tricks on you? No, guess again! Here’s the actual excerpt from the [Microsoft Support issue around the random music](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;261186).

> During normal operation or in Safe mode, your computer may play “Fur Elise” or “It’s a Small, Small World” seemingly at random. This is an indication sent to the PC speaker from the computer’s BIOS that the CPU fan is failing or has failed, or that the power supply voltages have drifted out of tolerance. This is a design feature of a detection circuit and system BIOSes developed by Award/Unicore from 1997 on.

Pure awesome.

I think this guy below just upgraded to Vista and was a tad pissed off:

  
  
Ok I’m done now.
