Ahh yes, the end of a long weekend. And not just any long weekend, the last long weekend of the summer. So long summer of 2009, it was nice to know you.

My niece and nephew head back to school tomorrow, which is sort of exciting for them. I always liked going back to school for some reason. Maybe it was buying a whole new batch of school supplies, or seeing some of your friends again after a summer apart. Granted, after about a week I was sick of the new year, but that first week was usually fun.

As for me, I took it pretty easy this weekend. I was originally supposed to go camping, but opted out of that at the last minute due to weather. Instead, I cleaned my apartment, moved a few things around, and ate most of my meals from the comfort of home. Tonight I even roasted a chicken and tried making some zucchini/goat-cheese appetizers that Dale told me about.

This upcoming weekend is the Canadian Country Music Awards in Vancouver. Despite having a media pass, I think I’m going to take a pass and skip the event. Truthfully, I just have a bit too much on my plate, and know that if I go next weekend I’ll be playing catch-up for weeks afterwards.

My main focus right now is preparing for my WordCamp Portland presentation that’s rapidly approaching. For some reason I thought I’d be only speaking for a half-hour, but turns out I have a full-hour slot, which means I need to add a pile of more content to my presentation. So I’ll be spending most evenings this week doing research and trying to flesh it out a bit more. Next weekend I’ll spend a bit of time going through it from front to back, so hopefully I’ll be ready before the event. I don’t think I’ve ever given a full hour-long presentation before, so we’re definitely in uncharted waters.

Other than that, it’s a fairly busy month work-wise. Thankfully we have nothing really on our plate for October, so we’re going to take a bit of a breather and relax after September.

PS – Not really sure why, but ever since I started taking a few vitamins a few weeks ago, I’ve found myself super hot most of the time. I know it’s not menopause, but even with the A/C on as low as it goes I’m pretty warm.
