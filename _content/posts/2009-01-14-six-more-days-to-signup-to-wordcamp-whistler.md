Yes folks, in only six more days we’ll be forced to close down registration for WordCamp Whistler so that we can give our final numbers to the Fairmont. Tickets are still available, [so if you’d like to come, make sure you sign up now.](http://tinyurl.com/9dv9q8) Included in the price of a ticket is a full day of WordPress and social media related talks, lunch, a few drinks at the social event, and a piece of one-of-a-kind WordPress schwag.

The participants of WordCamp Whistler have also been extended an invite to a Beer For Bloggers event up in Whistler on Friday, the 23rd. So if you’re up in Whistler by then, there are even more reasons to be a part of WordCamp Whistler. Also, we want to thank our current sponsors ([6S Marketing](http://www.6smarketing.com), [Molson](http://www.molson.com), [Automattic](http://www.automattic.com) and [RideBooker.com](http://www.ridebooker.com)) for helping make this a great event. We still have a few sponsorship spots available, so if you’re interested, [please visit the sponsorship page](http://www.wordcampwhistler.com/sponsorship/).
