I know I said I wouldn’t post again until after my surgery, but I took a few shots tonight, and liked this one the most. So enjoy.

The countdown is officially on — I had that exciting call with the nurse today, and got the green light from Houston to go ahead with the launch. I find out tomorrow afternoon the exact time of my surgery, and will spend part of the day cleaning up and getting ready for it.

Take care of the internet for me for a few days while I’m gone. Talk to you soon guys.
