My step mom was apparently trying to hang a picture or something this morning and accidentally banged her toe. The end result is clearly displayed in this photo:

Clearly her toe is broken. They spent a few hours in the hospital in Chilliwack today and finally put that sucker back in the correct spot. Unfortunately, sheâ€™ll be on crutches for a few weeks.
