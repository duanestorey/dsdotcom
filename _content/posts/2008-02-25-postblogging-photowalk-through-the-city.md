Today was a good day. I woke up this morning fully refreshed thanks to the 10 or 11 hours of sleep I got last night. I basically had no plans upon waking up, but found a message on my cell phone this morning from [Boris](http://bmannconsulting.com) saying that people were meeting up on commercial drive for some brunch.

There I met up with about twelve or so people, most of which attended Northern Voice. [Matt Mullenweg](http://ma.tt) (now with a +1 from here for his battle against the dancing dude) also swung by for some brunch, and to take his Nikon DSLR for a spin in our city.

All in all a really enjoyable day with some good people — the perfect end to Northern Voice and the weekend.
