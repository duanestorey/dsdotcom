Well, I just finished packing, and I’m heading out the door for the rockies. I’ll probably stop in Lake Louise tonight, maybe for two nights, and then do the Columbia Icefields highway to Jasper for another night. I should be back Sat night to see the fireworks. Apparently I’m heading to North Carolina next week with work, so my travelling isn’t over yet.
