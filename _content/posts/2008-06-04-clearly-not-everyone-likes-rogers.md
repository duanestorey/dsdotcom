Jay from [Giant Ant Media](http://giantantmedia.com/) just emailed me a few awesome YouTube videos they did with regards to [Roger’s customer service](http://www.rogers.com/web/resources/service/selectLanguageNonFlash.jsp?targetURL=%252Fweb%252FRogers.portal). I thought I’d share them with everyone, because they’re a riot.

Given the content of my last post, I think these are particularly relevant.

Now, I’ve been a Bell Mobility customer for a long time, and I can honestly say that they’re not very good either. I suspect the grass is always greener, but I’m fairly certain most wireless users in Canada would agree that we need some new blood in the market to help keep the current breed of wireless providers honest and competitive.
