I’ve always been a big fan of four day work weeks, or better yet, working at the rate which you are most productive. That’s why I have always gravitated towards jobs that don’t have fixed hours. Where I currently work, I really don’t have a fixed schedule. If I wake up early, I’ll stroll in at 8:30am. If I have a rough night sleeping, nobody cares when I stroll in at 10:30am. Given that flexibility, I’ll often do a bit of work at home during the evenings when I’m listening to music or whatever.

Utah recently announced that they are switching their government employees to [four day work weeks](http://money.cnn.com/2008/07/03/news/economy/utah_work.ap/index.htm). A four day work week has a lot of advantages. First, it gives people every Friday off to spend time with their families, or catch up on errands. Second, since you’re already at work and have already commuted there, it just is more efficient to work a few extra hours while you’re there. Also, as the article points out, it means less money spent on gas and reduced pollution.

Some people probably won’t like a 10 hour day, but I imagine most people would gladly work a few extra hours to get every Friday off. I know I would.
