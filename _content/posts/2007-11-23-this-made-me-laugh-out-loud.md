Mainly because I hate windows and I like star trek.

  
I removed the inline image once I realized it was 1.6 MB. You can view it [](http://farm.tucows.com/images/2006/06/data_bsod.gif)here.  
And also a neat little tidbit of information that I learned about by reading the history on the blue screen of death. In the new Mac OS, Leopard, the Finder shows all Windows machines it finds on the network as a CRT with a Blue Screen Of Death in it.
