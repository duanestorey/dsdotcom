I get enough of these types of emails that I basically don’t even really read them any more.

Here are a couple of things that bother me when I get these:

- I’m not really a Linux expert, something they’d know if they scanned my resume on this site. I also don’t have any ANDROID experience
- The grammar and spelling are screwy in a few spots — I’m expected to proof read my resume before submitting it, I think they should do the same
- I have no idea what Brussels is like. Given that my website is obviously Vancouver/BC based, it would probably be more effective to tell me things about Brussels I would like, or have a few links to life in Brussels

Anyways, I obviously already have a job I like, I just have never understood the lack of personal touches to these types of emails. It’s like going in for a job interview and having the interviewer read your resume for the first time while you’re sitting there — leaves a really bad taste in one’s mouth.
