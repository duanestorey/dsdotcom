I’m watching this video right now on YouTube. It’s fairly interesting, and I’ll place a few of my comments below:

1. Around 20:00 the guy actually sort of destroys his own thesis statement by saying how much they should have lost based on the calories consumed. If that were certain, there would really be no point in doing a study on macronutrient composition
2. Around 39:00 he mentions insulin resistance, which is what I talk about on here all the time (hyperinsulinema)
3. Around 41:00 he has another important thesis statement, “reducing the glycemic load may be especially important to achieve weight loss among individuals with high insulin secretion”
