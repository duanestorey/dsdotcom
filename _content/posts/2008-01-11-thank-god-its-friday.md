Ahh yes.. Friday.. So exciting.. This was a really good week. I hung out with friends, got some stuff done in the office, and have a pile of fun things to do this weekend. After work I’m meeting up with [Rebecca](http://miss604.com), Kasia and maybe [Keira](http://www.keira-anne.com) for some wings and beer. Life’s rough I know. Plus on the way over I want to buy a flash diffuser over at Leo’s Camera on Granville, something that I used at the last wedding I shot and wished I actually owned.

Tomorrow there are two parties, one for Rebecca’s birthday and one for Kasia’s. I have to make appearances at both, but I think I can pull it off. And on Sunday is the beach photowalk I’ve been organizing. Should be a great time. I’ll post some links to the photos once they start making their way onto Flickr.

I’m also listening to “Starts with One” by Shiny Toy Guns right now, and I have to say it’s fairly kick ass.
