Ok, so this is super geeky, but as a kid I used to love playing Transformers. For those of you who don’t know, Michael Bay (Armageddon) has been working on a full length action movie about the transformers, and it’s coming out July 4th.

The new exclusive trailer was just released a few minutes ago on Yahoo, and it looks pretty wild. It will probably suck as a movie, but it should be entertaining.

[Check it out here](http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/transformers.html;_ylt=Ag7nD4U_PTJ7WWTxEfAxzHtfVXcA).

\*\* Update — I have a new posting up about [The Transformers Movie](http://www.migratorynerd.com/2007/06/19/transformers-the-movie-almost-here/), so check it out.
