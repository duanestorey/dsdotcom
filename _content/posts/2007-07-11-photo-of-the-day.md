After talking it over with a few friends, I think I’ve finally decided to do a photo of the day on my blog. I plan on contributing a lot of my own photos to this, but I’m also calling on any readers to submit whatever photos they want and I’ll grab a few of those from time to time.

If you are on flickr and want to join the group, [you can find the group link here.](http://www.flickr.com/groups/391852@N24/) For now, I’m going to include the photo of the day in my main blog stream as well, but I also created [photooftheday.duanestorey.com](http://photooftheday.duanestorey.com) that has a custom, photo-centric view of the photos which I think is a nice way to view them.

This is a work in progress, and I plan to change some things around a bit more, but it’s a good start. Let me know what you think! Oh, and Stewart Marshall gets to be my first photo of the day.
