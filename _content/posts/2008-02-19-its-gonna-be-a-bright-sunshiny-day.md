Wow, what’s with this weather? It’s been absolutely gorgeous this winter. I’m lucky enough to have a bedroom with basically a full-wall window view of the downtown core, and every morning the sun reflecting off buildings wakes me up. It’s been rather nice having sunshine instead of the dreary rain Vancouver is known for in the winter.

I went out to Joey’s last night on Burrard Street to have some dinner with friends. It’s your typical Earl’s type restaurant with token hot girls and funky music. The food was pretty tasty though, with Cajun wings actually being served with a real hibachi type stove so you could blacken them at will. It’s nice to see a few more places pop up here and there to check out.

Today is of course another full day of work, but I’m hoping this sunshine carries on into the weekend. I’ll be out at UBC attending Northern Voice — I’ll do another blog entry soon about that. I hope some of you manage to get out and enjoy the sun a bit today.
