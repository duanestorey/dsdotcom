My friend Kelly sent me along this information, and I wanted to share it with everyone. Apparently Shaw Cable has been aggressively trying to hurt Novus in the Vancouver market. Here’s some information from the [10buckstoo.com](10buckstoo.com) website:

Shaw has been offering residents in buildings wired for Novus wildly aggressive rates that it’s not offering anyone else. This appears to be an attempt to eliminate Novus, its only local cable TV competition, which is unethical and unfair.

One of these offers is selling their Shaw Digital TV with:

- Two months free
- 200 digital channels
- $9.95/month for 10 months
- One year free rental of two PVRs
