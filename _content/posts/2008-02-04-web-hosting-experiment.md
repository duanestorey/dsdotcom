Hey guys. I want to do a fairly simple web experiment this week. I want to try to assess real-world uptime and latency for a bunch of popular hosting sites. I need a bunch of volunteers to help out. Basically all I’ll need you to do is upload a file to your root directory and allow me to ping it from time to time to do some measurements. I’ll tabulate the data next week and put it online for everyone to see.

So, if you can help out, drop me a comment and let me know:

1. The name of your hosting company
2. The address to your site
3. Your email address where I can contact you about this

The more people the better. Thanks. I am currently on [Media Temple](http://www.mediatemple.net/) and HostMonster, so I can represent those two.
