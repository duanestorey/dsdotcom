I went down to the Atlantic House the other day with [Rebecca](http://www.miss604.com), [John Bollwitt](http://www.johnbollwitt.com), and [John Biehler](http://www.johnbiehler.com). We did our best to help the Atlantic House with their excess beer problem, and eventually had to solicit the help of a few other people, namely Robert Scales and Kris Krug, who happened to be in the area and swung by.

Since I had my video camera on me, I thought I would take a quick stroll and see if I could find out what some of the people in Atlantic House thought about the Olympics. The end result is this 13 minute video, which Iâ€™m hoping to have on Blip.TV and/or YouTube sometime soon.
