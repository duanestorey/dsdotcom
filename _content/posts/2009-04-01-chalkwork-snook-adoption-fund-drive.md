Dave Shea is trying to help a fellow designer raise a bit of money for their adoption fund. To that end, he’s [donating the proceeds of the sales of his Chalkwork icons to the Snook adoption fund](http://www.mezzoblue.com/icons/chalkwork/snook/) for the next few weeks. If you’re looking for icons, now’s a great time to grab a set and help out a good cause at the same time.
