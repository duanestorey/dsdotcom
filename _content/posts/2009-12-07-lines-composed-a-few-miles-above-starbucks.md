Well, maybe not \*above\*, but at least \*at\* Starbucks. Feels weird being back into the groove again to be honest. I have never been on a two week vacation before, and it’s strange coming back again and trying to fire the engines up again, especially when the engines have been soaked in beer for two weeks.

I’m down at my local Starbucks in Vedder Crossing here trying to get everything in order so that I can hit everything hard again starting tomorrow. I started the evening with 400 messages in my inbox, and am down to around 15 now, which is a nice improvement. Once my inbox gets past about 50 messages, I start losing track of things I’ve replied to, so I like having it down to a more manageable level.

Dale and I planned out a six month strategy for BraveNewCode over the holidays, and tomorrow we’re going to start executing on it. Lots of exciting things coming down the pipe, and I don’t plan on sharing any of them until we’re done. But definitely [follow along with us](http://www.bravenewcode.com), especially if you’re using WordPress or any of our plugins (WPtouch, WordTwit, etc.).

I managed to hit the gym quite a few times while down in the Dominican, enough that I didn’t feel super guilty drinking beer most evenings. Thankfully when I got back I was the exact same weight I was when I left, so my strategy seemed to have worked. I’ve been to the gym twice here since getting back, and plan on trying to go five days a week again starting tomorrow. I’m pretty sure I get a free consult at the gym, so I’ll probably take advantage of it and try to get some kind of realistic five-day workout plan going.

Thanks to everyone who gave me some new music suggestions — I’m going to start buying/borrowing some of them over the next few weeks. Anyways, back at it.
