Well, ladies and gents, we just passed the halfway mark over here. I have to say, writing 24 blog entries has turned out to be more difficult than I imagined. I managed to close my eyes for a few minutes there are recharge my batteries slightly, but I’m currently in this weird groggy limbo that is making it hard to write anything.

For those of you arriving here on the day shift, welcome. Please browse the pages and visit all 24 entries so far. As you know, I am doing this 24 blogging marathon to support the Union Gospel Mission. If you are a reader and wouldn’t mind supporting their cause, then please head on over to lend some support. The only way these blogathons are a success is if we’re able to raise some money for charities such as the Union Gospel Misson.

I’m once again going to be on the lookout for exciting articles to post about. If you see or read anything, please feel free to pass it my way.
