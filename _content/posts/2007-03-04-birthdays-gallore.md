Wow, everyone’s getting older. This is a quick entry, because I just got in from Chilliwack and I’m a bit bagged. First, my mom’s birthday was on Friday, so a big happy birthday to her. Also, Jennifer, Cory, Robbie, Margo and Mike all turned 30 in the past few weeks. Tonight was also another Jen’s birthday out here in Vancouver. So, a big happy birthday to all of you.

Some of us met out in Chilliwack tonight for a dual housewarming / birthday party for everyone. Cory and Tanya’s new place is really awesome, and it was great to see some old high school friends again.
