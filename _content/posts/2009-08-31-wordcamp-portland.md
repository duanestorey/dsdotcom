I just finished booking my flight to WordCamp Portland, so I figured now was a good time to write a post about it. I was a co-organizer for two WordCamp Vancouver events, as well as one up in Whistler, but strangely enough I haven’t actually spoken at a WordCamp for almost about two years now. So having me up front should make for some interesting entertainment.

I’ll be speaking on mobile blogging, with an emphasis on our WPtouch plugin. I’ll probably also talk a bit about mobile blogging in general, similarly to what I talked about at the Network Hub a few years ago. If I have time, I’ll probably also touch on the WordPress iPhone application a bit, and whatever else in the mobile sphere I can find. [Matt Mullenweg](http://ma.tt) will also be holding a town-hall type of event where the audience can ask a bunch of WordPress questions, so that should be fun.

I’ll be flying out of Bellingham on the 18th of September, and returning late at night on the 20th. I’m not sure where I’ll be staying yet, but a few people pinged me on Twitter with some possible options, so we’ll see where those lead. I believe I’m currently slotted to speak on Sunday sometime, so Saturday will probably be the day I start putting my slides together. I imagine there will be some type of social on Saturday as well, so that should be fun.
