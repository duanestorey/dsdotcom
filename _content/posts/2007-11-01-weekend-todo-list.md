I’m so far behind on everything, it’s not even funny. Being in the hospital set me back over a week, and my recent trip out east set me back even further. I’m going to try and use this weekend to catch up. Here’s what I need to do.

1. Tidy apartment and do laundry. I hate this part.
2. Unfuck photoshop some how
3. Mail photos to everyone
4. Backup computer and free some space
5. Install XP via boot camp so I can play games
6. Finish wedding photos for Mike and Kim (sorry guys)
7. Answer a bazillion emails that I haven’t yet. If I haven’t answered you, I’m sorry 🙁 If I have, feel lucky!
8. Drink some booze to celebrate being off of antibiotics
9. Catch up on Heroes season two
10. Go outside a shoot a pile of photos. I haven’t done this in quite a while, and I miss it.

On another note, seems like a I have a few more people interested in me shooting their weddings, so stay tuned.
