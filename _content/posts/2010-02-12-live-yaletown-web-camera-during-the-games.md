If you’re stuck at home during some of the festivities over the next few weeks, don’t fret entirely. Yes, you’ll miss out on TONS of great events, but the good news is you can catch a few things remotely.

To that end there’s a new Yaletown web camera that’s now operational that gives views to the North and South. Tomorrow you’ll be able to see the Torch Relay go through that area by watching on the web cam.

The webcam is sponsored by Wasserman + Partners Advertising, and can be viewed [here](http://www.wasserman-partners.com/) (the links to activate it are in the top-right corner). Enjoy!
