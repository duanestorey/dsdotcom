A few months ago I had an offer on my website to send a few people some free photo prints. Due to my hospitalization and recent health battles, I never got around to mailing any of them out. Thankfully, I found some time tonight to put a bunch of them together, and they will be going out in the mail.

Unfortunately, not all the people who were supposed to receive one sent me their address, so I still have some to send out. If you were pretty sure you were receiving one, can you please fire me off an email with your address and which print you wanted? Thanks.

Also, once these are all out of the way, I will be doing a contest for a one shot item, something that I think will be really nice. Check back next week.
