Update: Here are the [slides from the presentation](http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/GoingSocial1.pdf) – enjoy!

I’m giving a talk in a few hours down at [The Network Hub](http://www.thenetworkhub.ca/), and wanted to start a post here for some of the information.

For those of you who can’t make it or are stuck on the waitlist, I’ll be talking about the following items:

- Creative Commons Licensing
- WordPress and Social Media Stats
- Plugin: Copyrighted Posts (Licensing Content)
- Plugin: Tweet, Like, Google +1 and Share (Sharing)
- Plugin: ShareThis (Sharing)
- Plugin: Sociable (Sharing)
- Plugin: Flickr RSS (Flickr)
- Plugin: MudSlideShow (Flickr/Picassa)
- Post From Flickr to WordPress (Flickr)
- Plugin: Viper’s Video Quicktags (Video)
- Disqus Commenting System
- Plugin: Add Link To Facebook (Facebook)
- Plugin: TweetMeme (Twitter)
- Plugin: WordTwit (Twitter)
- Plugin: WordTwit Pro (Twitter)
- Custom short URLs courtesy of YOURLs

It’s a pretty demo-heavy presentation, so the slides will only be useful in that they’ll point you in the right direction. But the list above should help, and are some of the plugins I’ve used and would recommend to make using WordPress with social media a bit easier.

I’ll try and snap some photos as well tonight and post some of them here as well. Looking forward to meeting some new people, and catching up with some of the old ones!
