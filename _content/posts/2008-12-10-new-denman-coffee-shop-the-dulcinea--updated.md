My friend Stacey just sent me a message on Facebook and told me that her family just opened a new coffee shop on Denman called Dulcinea. Apparently they have really great Spanish Coffee, as well as some great chocolate drinks. Here’s a [little blurb on the internet](http://tastyturntable.com/2008/10/06/dulcinea/) about them from last month:

> After my favorite chocolate cafe, Koko, closed it’s doors earlier this year – I was heartbroken. To my relief, it finally reopened on October 1st. Well, not exactly – it’s still a chocolate cafe in the same location – but the new place has different owners, a different theme, and a different name: The Dulcinea. I no longer have access to Koko’s amazing premier chocolates, but something wonderful has taken its place. This new chocolate cafe has a strong Spanish streak running through it and staff that know what they’re doing when it comes to chocolate.
> 
> The Dulcinea offers a variety of desserts, espressos, spanish chocolate drinks and a selection of tapas. The prices at first glance may seem a little steep – but are actually reasonable considering the excellent quality of their offerings. \[…\]
> 
> The service is quick and uber-polite. The staff is trying real hard to iron out the little unexpected problems with a new business. The kids running the place and the Spanish flair certainly cement Dulcinea’s early reputation already making them more lively than surrounding shops. Hopefully they’ll flourish.

Their website is [still a work in progress](http://www.dulcineachocolatecafe.com/), but it looks like it’s coming along. If you’re in the area, stop by and tell them Duane sent you!
