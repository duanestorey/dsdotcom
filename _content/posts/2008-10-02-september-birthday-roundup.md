There were a few birthdays last month that I sort of missed in terms of blog entries. I do my best to get them all, but sometimes my schedule gets the best of me.

The first birthday was my step-mom, Cathy’s. Cathy’s been an important person in my life ever since I was a little kid, and she’s still there to help out today.

And the other birthday was [John Bollwitt](http://www.johnbollwitt.com), who recently celebrated the big three-oh.

Happy (belated) birthday guys.
