Many people don’t realize that if they are in another country that they will often have to pay for all their medical expenses out of their own pocket. A simple visit to a doctor’s office probably won’t set you back too far in most countries, but being hospitalized can potentially bankrupt a person in certain parts of the world, such as the United States. I had a friend who got into a scooter accident in Thailand years ago, and only avoided hefty medical bills thanks to the travel health insurance he purchased before leaving Canada.

So without a doubt one of the first items that should be on everyone’s to-do list for an upcoming trip is to either insure that you have adequate travel health insurance for your trip, or purchase travel insurance before leaving.

### Check For Pre-existing Coverage

If you have a higher end credit card, often one that has an annual fee, it will sometimes include travel health insurance for a period of time. In my experience they usually cover trips for 14 days or less, but nothing that’s of a longer duration.

If you have a health care plan through your work or through a third-party, you can check if there are any provisions in your policy to provide health insurance while travelling. Chances are though your health insurance policy won’t provide any substantial coverage for travelling, so you will likely need to buy your own.
