I turned on the computer in the other room for the first time in a while. My goal was to pull off some of the nearly 10,000 photos I have on it and put some of them up on flickr, and some onto an archival drive I have around. I’ve added some of the photos here for your viewing pleasure. I wasn’t as good with photoshop in the old days, so not all of these are that great by my standards today. A lot of these were actually taken with an old Nikon digital point and shoot I had. But, I still like most of these.
