[![](_images/happy-birthday-tony-1.jpg "1786474743_b7f66e1fa4")](http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/1786474743_b7f66e1fa4.jpg)

Today is [Tony Pierce’s](http://blog.tonypierce.com/) 104th birthday. Tony’s a great guy who has built himself quite the media empire down in LA. The last time I saw Tony, it was at some dimly lit, somewhat seedy strip club in east Hollywood. Prior to that, Tony and I sat in his car in some parking lot, drinking cheap beer out of a brown bag and reminiscing about life. Good times.

Have yourself a good birthday dude, and try not to get into too much trouble.
