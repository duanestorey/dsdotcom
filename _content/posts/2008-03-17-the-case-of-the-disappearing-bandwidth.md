This morning I went to use my internet and was redirected to a page that indicated I had exceeded my bandwidth for the month. Granted, with my recent purchase of Apple TV, I have been using more bandwidth. But as far as I’m concerned it’s not anything crazy (the odd TV show), and it’s strange to me that I hit my limit.

I upgraded to the next plan up which is a small SoHo package for now. The part that concerns me is that my upstream bandwidth was larger than my downstream, which makes no sense at all based on the things I do with my computer. My NAT is locked down, so it’s basically impossible for someone to be stealing my bandwidth from me, and I rarely torrent. So for now, I really have no idea what’s going on.

I’m going to keep a watch on it from my admin panel for Novus and see what happens. Do all you guys on Telus and Shaw have pretty hardcore limits these days?
