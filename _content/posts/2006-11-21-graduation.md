Iâ€™ll be graduating from UBC tomorrow at 1:30pm. If anyone wants to check out a live feed of the ceremony, go to [the UBC website and watch the stream](http://www.graduation.ubc.ca/webcast/index.html).

My degree is a Masters of Applied Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering (with a Specialization in Multimedia and Video Compression).
