I thought I had a blog entry ready to go here, but apparently I didn’t. We just listed to Mojave Band play a few songs down here at Workspace, and it was really awesome. Given that I only had five hours of sleep last night, I should feel way worse than I already do. But strangely enough, I feel not bad. I went down to the Lamplighter and picked up a few beers with Paul, so I’ve been casually sipping a few while staring out onto the water.

Anyways, I’m only $30 away from goal #2, so I’m hoping I hit that in the near future! Thanks everyone.
