I finished my presentation about an hour ago, and have just been drinking a bit of beer since then. I just wrote a little post over at BraveNewCode about a cool little addition I had for my WordCamp Portland presentation, and wanted to post about it here. Both Andrew Sampson and comedian Stephen Fry contributed some data and a video for my presentation, talking about WPtouch and WordPress. It was very much appreciated, and was extremely well received down here.

You can read the whole entry over at [BraveNewCode](http://www.bravenewcode.com/2009/09/19/stephen-fry-talks-about-wptouch-and-wordpress/), or check out the video here:
