So that stupid opacity problem has finally pissed me off enough to start to do something about it. There has to be a bug in my theme somewhere that’s doing it, but I haven’t been able to pinpoint it exactly. For now I’m switching to this theme, even thought it’s a bit buggy too (it’s only temporary)..

Actually, after disabling my theme and all plugins, the problem still exists in other themes.. I’ve only noticed it on my mac using Camino or Firefox, so I wonder if there’s something wrong there.. I don’t see the problem on a PC. Grr…

\*\* Update – so, after spending a few minutes on it, I’m prepared to say this. It’s in no way related to any plugins I am using, and the opacity problem spans multiple themes by multiple authors. And it only seems to affect Mac OS X and any browser based on the Mozilla engine (including Camino and Firefox). Weird. So, if you want the problem to go away, you have to use Safari for now.
