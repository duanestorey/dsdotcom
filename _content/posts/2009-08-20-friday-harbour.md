First, I gotta say, I’m all over this little pub at Cultus Lake. I first came up here with Rebecca and John on the weekend, but it not only has one of the nicest patios I’ve been on in a while, but a pretty decent selection of food and drinks as well. I’m fairly certain they’re all gonna know me by name here pretty soon.

This weekend I’m meeting my friend Lynn down in Anacortes, WA, and we’re going to take the little ferry over to [Friday Harbor](http://www.fridayharbor.com/) for the day. I actually was there a very long time ago (it was a field trip back in high school for some of us), and I remember it being fairly cool, especially the ferry ride. So I’m definitely looking forward to heading back and seeing it again, some 14 years later.

My only hope for the trip (other than catching up with a friend) is to hopefully find a little hole in the wall establishment that serves fresh fish and chips. Other than that, I’ll be packing my camera around, and hoping to take a few shots near the ocean. Should be fun.
