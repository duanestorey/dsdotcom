Wow, I just woke up. Not a very exciting day, but it’s nice to have a good rest. I got up earlier and went for a walk, stopped by the plant shop, and headed home to see what was on TV. I was pleasantly surprised that [Garden State](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333766/) was on, so I watched that (I saw it about 6 months ago, and really liked it — although Natalie Portman was a bit stiff as always). Several things stuck out this time:

- Natalie Portman isn’t a very good actress (IMO)
- Zach Braff directed the movie (I didn’t know that the first time around)
- He also looks a lot like John Ritter did when he was younger
- The soundtrack kicks ass

After the movie, I went online and “bought” the soundtrack, and proceeded to fall asleep on my couch listening to it. And here I am now, awake at song 12. I think I’m going to charge up my iPod, put the soundtrack on it, and head outside to see where I end up.
