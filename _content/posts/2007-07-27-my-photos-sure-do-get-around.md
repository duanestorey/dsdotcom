As everyone who hits my blog these days knows, I really like taking photos. My passion for photography started about seven years ago, and is still going strong today. I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to afford a really nice camera and a full suite of lenses, and while I sort of understand what’s needed to take “good” photos, my camera really does the majority of the heavy lifting.

My friends routinely use my photos in blog posts (which I really appreciate), but every once and a while I do a quick search via [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com) to see who else is using my photos. Tonight, that search led me to one of the coolest sites ever to link to a photo set of mine — a semi-local blogger and nude-model, [Kris Madison](http://www.krismadison.com/blog/2007/07/summer-fun.htm).

If you want to [head over and check it out](http://www.krismadison.com/blog/index.htm), by all means. I should point out though that it is definitely **not safe for work**.

I would like to encourage all other nude models in the city to link to my photos. If you have any trouble, please do not hesitate to contact me — I’d me more than happy to assist you.
