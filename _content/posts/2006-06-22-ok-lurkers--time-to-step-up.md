I check my weblog periodically to see who actually reads my web page.. I mean, if nobody is coming here, there’s not much point in putting tons of effort into it (although it gives me something to do). However, I’m averaging a between 200 – 400 unique visitors a month that aren’t web crawlers, but only about 2 or 3 of you are commenting. So my question is, who are the rest of you!?

If you stop by here, please sign my guestbook so I can see where you came from and maybe check out your web page too! Thanks!

Here’s a random shot from when I was in Costa Rica.
