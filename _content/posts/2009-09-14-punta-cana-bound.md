It’s official – vacation is booked. I’ll be leaving Vancouver on the 19th of November, and heading to the Dominican Republic for two weeks. I’ve never really been anywhere on vacation for two weeks, so it’ll be an interesting experience.

I’m heading to [the Bahia Principe Punta Cana ](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147293-d478252-Reviews-Gran_Bahia_Principe_Bavaro-Punta_Cana_Dominican_Republic.html) with Dale and Sara for a few weeks. I’ve been told that the beaches in Punta Cana are fairly amazing, so I’m looking forward to that. Plus, we’re staying in the Golden Club section which means we should hopefully be near the beach.

Anyways, should be a great time.
