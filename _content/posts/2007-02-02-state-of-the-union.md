Well, I haven’t had an interesting blog entry in a while, so I thought I’d give an update. I went out with Jana tonight to Sandbar on Granville Island — it was a great time, and an absolutely amazing night to spend on an outdoor patio with good company and a bottle of wine. After I came back home and demonstrated my oh-so-rusty guitar skills in front of a live audience.

This week is completely packed solid, so look forward to a pile of photos from the events.. Next update will probably be in a few days 🙁
