I watched Test The Nation tonight to see how the Bloggers and Rebecca faired on the show. The bloggers, in pure geeky awesomeness, managed the win!

Congrats guys! You did us all proud.

[John Biehler](http://johnbiehler.com/) posted some great clips of Rebecca rocking Test The Nation. Check it out (and listen to the idiots booing in the background — I guess they thought they’d win?)
