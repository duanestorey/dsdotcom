It seems that after eight years of university I’ve acquired a fairy large array of engineering books. Since I haven’t read any of them in years, I figure I might as well sell a few of them off. Here’s a list of some of them. If you’re interested, drop me a comment. Also, please feel free to forward this list on to any physics or electrical engineering students.

- Digital Signal Processing, Emmanuel C. Ifeachor
- Introduction to Electrodymanics, Griffiths
- Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Griffiths
