I finished my antibiotics last week, which in theory meant I should have been completely fine and back to normal. Unfortunately, that’s not the case, something that sometimes happens with this type of infection I have. I spent a bit of time in the doctor’s office yesterday, and for whatever reason, they want a full spectrum of tests done again just to make sure they didn’t miss anything. Except for some cramps, it’s not really affecting me that much, but I’m anxious to be all over this.

I’m heading down to the lab right now to get a blood draw, and then off to work. Going over to a friend’s house for dinner later, and to play with baby Maya!
