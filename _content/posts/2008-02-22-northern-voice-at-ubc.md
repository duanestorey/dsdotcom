Northern Voice is officially rolling out at UBC. Since today is an unconference, people are putting their ideas up on the wall for sessions that will happen during the day. I’m still waiting to here when the Internet Bootcamp and Photocamp sessions are.

Will drop a few more blog entries as the day goes on. Check my Flickr stream for photos as they happen.
