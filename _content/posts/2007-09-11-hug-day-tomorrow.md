I was just over at [Rebecca’s blog reading about “Free Hug Day” in Vancouver](http://www.miss604.com/2007/09/free-hug-day-in-vancouver-today.html). I think it’s a great idea, and I feel like I really need to do my part to help out.

So, for tomorrow only, I’d like to encourage all single girls to come up and give me a hug. I’ve been told I’m quite huggable, and it’s the least I can do to help out with this great Vancouver event.

I mean come on, who wouldn’t want to hug the guy on the tractor?
