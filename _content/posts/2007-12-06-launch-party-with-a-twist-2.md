Tonight I went down to the Republic to partake in the second Launch Party. It’s basically a mixer for technology enthusiasts, and an opportunity for a few startups to showcase their new products.

The Sxip GirlsI’m still on some drugs, so I refrained from drinking, which was actually rather nice in a way since I spent $0 at the function tonight.
