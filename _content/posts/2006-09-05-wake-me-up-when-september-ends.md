Man, it’s been quite a while since I posted a blog entry.. My apologies to the three people who read this on a regular basis — I won’t let you down again. The truth is, I haven’t had much time to do much of anything recently. I spent most of the weekend at work, or at least on my couch with my laptop working — there’s still a lot to do for VON, but it’s starting to shape up… It’s only the start of September, but I already know it’s going to be one of those crazy busy months that I’ll be glad is behind me when it’s all over..

I’ve slowly been working myself back into the dating scene.. I started with lavalife a while ago (when I was “shopping” last time, I had about six dates before finding my last gf, of which maybe three of them were pretty cool).. Unfortunately, it seems like all the good ones are gone, because all the ones I’ve chatted with seem really superficial or overly self-important. Maybe Matt Good was right.

Next I tried craigslist a few times, but that hasn’t really been much better. I’m at the point where I’m just going to cut out some cardboard, tie it around my neck with the words “educated. have job. available.” and head to to granville street with a cup. If that doesn’t work, I’ll come back once I add the words “free nachos.” because let’s face it — who doesn’t want free nachos?

I really gotta start getting out more and meeting new people.. And the truth is, I really don’t know what the answer is anymore. Everyone always says “go hang out at the library,” but seriously, I don’t want to hang out at the library. Who hangs out at the library anyways? I remember being in Ottawa and doing the Parliament tour.. They show you the big library at the back, and hey, guess what — nobody is in there — all the books are on CDROM now, and everyone is looking at the goods in their offices.

Not much else new. It’s almost time for the pig party. That’s right. The pig party. I have this piggy bank that I’ve been feeding for over a year (I actually had another piggy bank that was full, but some fucker stole him from my elevator when I was moving in), and he’s nearly full. I weighed him yesterday on my digital scale, and he has 19.5 lbs of money in him. So anyways, I said when he was full, I was going to have some people over to help drink a piggy bank’s worth of booze one night. So stay tuned for something in the next few months. Any body have any idea how much money 19.5 lbs of change is?
