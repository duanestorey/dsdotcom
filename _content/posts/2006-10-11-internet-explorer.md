Someone pointed out to me that my blog looks a bit stupid in Internet Explorer (IE). So, if you’re using IE, and my website sucks more than usual, that’s why. I’ll attempt to repair the IE CSS at some point, but until then, do yourself a favour and [switch to Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/).

Based on my weblog, 56% of the people are using Firefox (yay!) and 32% are using IE (boo!). A few of you wild, crazy people are even using a version of Netscape.

From like five years ago. 🙁
