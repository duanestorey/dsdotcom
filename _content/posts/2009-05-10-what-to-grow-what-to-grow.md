I was thinking about setting up a little garden on my patio. Obviously, I don’t really have a lot of room out there, so growing things like potatoes are out of the question (not that I’d grow potatoes or anything). I could grow some herbs maybe I guess, but I’m not really sure when they grow best. I’m also thinking about putting a little compost bin outside so I can make some healthy soil for all my plants here.

Any thoughts?
