Today is my mom’s birthday! Like almost everyone older than me, she just turned 39 today. That means she has many long, happy years of bingo playing ahead of her!

My mom was pretty sad when I moved out of Chilliwack, but she’s been taking my absence like a trooper. I try and do a call with her at least once a week, and we catch up on all the excitement back in cow town. I hope she has a great day today, and that people at work treat her to lunch or something awesome like that.

Happy Birthday Mom!
