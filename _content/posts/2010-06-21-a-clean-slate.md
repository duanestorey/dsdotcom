As you can see, things around here have changed. I finally got around to doing something I’ve wanted to do for quite sometime – I’ve removed all my old entries. Obviously I have backups of everything I wrote, and can reimport things at a later time. But truthfully, pretty much everything I wrote in the old days is all over the map, and I’ve been thinking about starting to write consistently in a few different areas.

In terms of the look and feel, this is the default 2010 theme with WordPress 3.0. I debated spending some time re-theming this site again, but just don’t really feel like spending the time and effort this time around. So for now, I’m just going to use the default theme and place my focus on generating content for a change.

The two areas I’ll probably focus on in the short term are food/cooking and finances, the latter of which I’ve started to become more interested in these last few years. I’m obviously no expert in either, but since I enjoy both topics and I enjoy writing, I figure it’ll be fun to explore both of them over the next few months.
