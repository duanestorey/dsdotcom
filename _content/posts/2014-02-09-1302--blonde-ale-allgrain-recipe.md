I friend of mine recently asked if I was putting all my beer recipes online, and I unfortunately was forced to answer no. When I started brewing I tried to put them all online, but the write-ups just took too long.

So I’ve decided to start posting them again, but in a very limited format. That way it doesn’t take me long to post them, and hopefully I can solicit input from others.

#### Beer Information

My goal for this beer was to make something easily drinkable for some of my family that generally prefers lagers, and tend not to like really bitter ales. I find most blonde ales a bit boring, so I mashed it at 152F to add a bit of body to it, and also used some left-over hops (in small quantities) from a recent IPA I had. I’m hoping these end-up having a subtle presence (due to the lower amounts used), even though they are hops with noticeable characters on their own.

Here are the target stats for this brew:

- BJCP Style: Light Hybrid Beer, Blonde Ale
- OG: 1.049
- FG: 1.012
- IBU: 17
- Color: 4.7
- Batch Size: 5G

- Mash Temperature: 152F

**Grain Bill**

Fairly typical grain bill for a low gravity ale, although I added a tiny bit of wheat malt for some added complexity. Had I had normal Canadian 2-row malt on-hand I would have used that, but instead I used grains from my sack of Pale Alt malt.

- 11lb 8oz – Canadian Pale Ale Malt
- 8oz – Wheat Malt
- 4oz – Caramel 10L
- 2oz – Caramel 15L

**Hop Bill/Schedule**

- 0.25oz Citra @60 mins
- 0.25oz Centennial @30 mins
- 0.25oz Chinook @10mins

**Fermentation**

- Yeast: Wyeast 1056
- Temperature: 68F
- Duration: 2 Weeks
- Dry-hopping: None

### Notes

I haven’t tasted this one yet, as it’s been clearing in a fridge at home for the last 5 weeks. But I’ll update this post when I get back and tapped. Looking at it before I left though, it seems slightly darker than predicted, likely because the SRM for the pale alt malt I used didn’t quite match the one in BeerAlchemy. Not a big deal though.
