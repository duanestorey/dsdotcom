In less than 8 hours, Blogathon 2009 will begin. I’m currently hanging out at [Rebecca’s house](http://www.miss604.com), watching Stand By Me and eating popcorn. I started working on a little spreadsheet of blog entries for tomorrow, but only filled in about 15 spots or so, which means the other 34 will have to be decided sometime tomorrow.

To be honest, I’m fairly beat. I don’t even recall last year’s Blogathon at this point, although I do remember hanging out at my place with Rebecca, John and Raul, sometime around midnight. I imagine somehow I’ll make it to the end tomorrow, but at this point I think it’s going to be a fairly challenging day, even with the copious amounts of caffeine I’m undoubtedly going to drink.

I have my SLR camera with me, so I’ll probably mix up the postings tomorrow with some semi-live shots of people and the areas around Gastown. There’s talk about an impromptu photo walk in the area as well, so we’ll probably get some fresh air at some point and take some photos.

Thanks to everyone’s support, I’m currently sitting at about $600, which is 60% of the way towards my $1,000 goal. If you’d like to support my Blogathon effort, or the BC Children’s Hospital Foundation, please consider [donating here](http://www.canadahelps.org/GivingPages/GivingPage.aspx?gpID=4875). I’m heading to bed in a sec — next stop, 5am, and a full day of blogging.
