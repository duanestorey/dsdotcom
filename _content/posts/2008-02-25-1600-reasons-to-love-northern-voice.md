[![Northern Voice 2008 Mosaic](http://www.migratorynerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/2289944327_ec09f6bf03.jpg)](http://www.migratorynerd.com/data/nv08mosaic.jpg)Last night while lying in bed I had the crazy idea to try and make a mosaic out of all the photos from Northern Voice. Tonight, while sitting in front of the TV, I decided to make an attempt at it. So, here is the end result.

Itâ€™s 40 tiles wide by 40 tiles tall, for a total of 1600 individual images. If you want to see it large, click on the image to download a huge version (approximate 9MB).
