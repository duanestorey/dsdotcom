No real surprise here, but [this article talks about the seemingly inevitable death of the newspaper](http://news.slashdot.org/news/08/03/30/1828252.shtml). I don’t think I’ve picked one up in ages, and for the most part get most of my news from various news agencies on the web and from RSS feeds for peers.

Some people argue that user-generated content is bound to be less reliable, but as most of you know, many of the huge news organizations are incredibly biased. Which is better, I’m not sure, but I’d rather trust my peers than some dolled up girl on TV reading off a teleprompter.
