I had a guy come up to me at work today (yes, you know who you are) and complain because my blog didn’t look good in IE6. If you’re using IE6, and you’ve having problems, here’s what you should do:

Upgrade to a real browser!!! 

Seriously, Firefox is free and I believe so is IE7 now. I really don’t have the time to customize every theme for every browser. IE6 is old and it’s so not standards compliant it’s not even funny. Stop living in a cave and upgrade to something decent already. And if you don’t want to, then subscribe to my RSS feed and read my blog that way.
