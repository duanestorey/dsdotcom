Last night I pulled my camera off the shelf, blew a layer of dust off of it, and headed down to gastown for a quick photowalk. [Kris Krug](http://www.staticphotography.com) has done a pretty stellar job of organizing these from time to time, and it’s a good chance for people to get together, learn a few tricks, and hang out with good company.

We strolled around the tracks is Gastown, then made a loop around and came back through Blood Alley. Afterwards, we stopped at the Six Acres for some beers, and then eventually went to Kris’ house for a little wine.

I took tomorrow off, and I’m heading up to Cultus Lake with a few friends to enjoy some R &amp; R time by the water. So, you can consider the blog out of service during the weekend.
