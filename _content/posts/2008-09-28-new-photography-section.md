One of the areas of my website that I lost with the last theme change was my photography section. To be honest, it wasn’t that complete before, but since photography is such a big part of my life, I miss having it around.

Tonight I sat in front of the TV and put together a new one. I extended some recent code I had written for SmugMug to pull in my photos from there. I’m going to slowly add some of my photos that I think might interest organizations looking for Vancouver photos, or various photography from some of the concerts I’ve attended.

So, feel free to [head on over](/photography/) and check out the new photography page.
