This Thursday, I’ll be photographing a charity fundraiser down at the Sanafir Restaurant &amp; Lounge in Vancouver. The event is put on by local fashion designer [Roberta Cheema](http://www.tushltd.com/swimwear.html) from [Tush](http://www.tushltd.com/), and will consist of swimwear and lingeree.

In other interesting news, I’m somehow the number one website that shows up when you do a Google image search for Heroe’s Kirsten Bell. The image was in [that entry I did about the hottest girls from 2007](http://www.migratorynerd.com/2008/01/hottest-movietv-girl-from-2007/).
