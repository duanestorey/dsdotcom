My friend Kim owns a store on the border of gastown called [Discollection](http://www.discollection.ca), and it turns out that to celebrate their one year anniversary [they are having a big fill-a-bag sale](http://discollection.ca/2007/03/01/one-year-anniversary-customer-appreciation-sale-saturday-march-3rd/). So, if youâ€™re into vintage clothing or just want to check out some cool stuff, head on down this this Saturday and join in on the fun.

You can find the store location [here](http://discollection.ca/contact-discollection/).
