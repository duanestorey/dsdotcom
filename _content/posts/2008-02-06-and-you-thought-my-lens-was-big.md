[![Canon 1200 f/5.6L](http://www.migratorynerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/67748045hxh0zjhscanon12005.jpg)](http://www.pbase.com/)Image from PBase.comThat, my friends, is Canonâ€™s biggest lens, the Canon EF 1200mm f/5.6L. For obvious reasons, they only make a handful of these every year. The cost? Approximately $10,000 $100,000 if I remember correctly.
