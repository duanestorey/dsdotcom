CNN [posted some videos](http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/01/17/usair.splash.video/index.html) from the Airbus plane that ditched into the Hudson the other day. Ditching is actually a fairly common practice for military aircraft, obviously less common for passenger aircraft. To pull of a successful ditch, you basically have to have a perfect landing such that the wings donâ€™t dip and hit the water. Thankfully the pilot pulled it off, and every single person survived this incident (which is rare for a commercial passenger jet).

Kind of strange though that this current incident was caught by so many independent cameras, and yet the airplane that hit the Pentagon on September 11th generated basically no footage, except of course the blocky, blurry footage released by the Pentagon.
