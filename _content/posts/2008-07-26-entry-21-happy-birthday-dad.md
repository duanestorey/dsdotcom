Today is my father’s birthday. He has been spending the last few days on a great fishing trip adventure, flying around various parts of British Columbia with some friends and fishing. As I’ve pointed out before, my dad is not only my father, but also one of my good friends. We’ve had lots of great adventures together, and hopefully we’ll keep the tradition going.

Given that we’re both so busy these days, it’s not very often we manage to get together and hang out. But that fact makes the time we do spend together that much more enjoyable.

So on that note, I want to wish my dad an awesome birthday. Happy Birthday bud.
