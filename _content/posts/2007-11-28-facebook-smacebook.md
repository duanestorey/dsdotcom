Is it just me, or is facebook getting a little old these days? Except for the event planning thing, which I think is fairly useful, there’s not really a lot about it that I really think is that great anymore. And to be honest, I’m getting a little tired of saying ignore to things like the funwall, or turkey tossing and what have you. I know people are just having a little fun with it, but I’m just not that interested in alot of those things everyone is inviting each other with. It’s not really a big deal, as I don’t get enough of them to where it takes a lot of time out of my day, I just don’t really get the appeal is all I guess.

It would be nice if facebook kept track of which apps you’ve said no to, and would automatically pull you out of invitation lists based on your past history. If I’ve said no to funwall once, chances are I don’t really want it.
