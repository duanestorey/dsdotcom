I was talking to good pal and fellow blogger [Rebecca Bollwitt](http://miss604.com) (aka miss604) online today, and she told me that she has recently been accepted to be on CBC’s [Test The Nation](http://www.cbc.ca/testthenation/) show in a few weeks. This is obviously really exciting, and Rebecca will be part of a team of bloggers attempting to show off their combined knowledge on national TV.

Congrats Rebecca, and best of luck on the show. We’ll do a group watching event here when the time comes. You can read more about it [over on her site](http://www.miss604.com/2008/01/toronto-is-giving-me-an-iq-test.html).
