I’m in the market for a new laptop bag. I currently have a backpack which holds my laptop and my camera gear, but when I don’t carry my camera gear I find the bag is fairly big and bulky. So, I’d like to pick up a nice, slim laptop bag that goes over my shoulder.

I googled a bit this morning trying to find recommendations where to go, but most of those sites just talked about bags and didn’t really point me in any useful directions. Rebecca gave me the name of a site on Robson, but when I went by this morning they were still closed.

Can anyone recommend a good place to buy a laptop bag? I’d like something a little more modern and less London Drugs-like.
