I’m just heading out the door to take my car in to get looked at. There’s nothing wrong mechanically with it, but Mazda called me out of the blue last week and asked me to swing by so they can look at my stereo. Apparently they might have put in the wrong one when I had it replaced about a month ago (which is strange, because it works and fits fine). I suspect there’s some recall they aren’t telling me about.

But anyways, they are going to replace the CD player I imagine, and they also offered to detail my car for me in exchange for the hassle.

It’s supposed to be a nice sunny day out in Vancouver today (28C I’m told). There really aren’t that many days like this left before the rain hits, so take advantage of them while they last.

I was processing a few old photos last night, and found one of Feist I had never played with before. Enjoy.
