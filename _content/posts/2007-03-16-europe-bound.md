This morning I came into work fully expecting to have a long day and then go home to bed. But it now appears I have to go home, do laundry, and pack for a last minute trip to Finland. Which is cool I guess, since I’ve never been anywhere in Europe before (which in itself is strange considering how much travelling I’ve done). It’s going to be a work related trip, so I probably won’t have too much time to relax, but I’m taking a few days at the end (I hope) to explore a little bit and see what it’s like.
