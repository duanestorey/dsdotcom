So tonight I had originally planned to come home and work on some costume ideas.. However, while on my way home, Hesty stopped me and thought it would be a good idea to go grab a drink or two at a pub on the way home.. Thinking I wouldn’t be out very late, I tagged along.. However, Adrian then invited us down to the Wild Coyote for a cool Russian Party. Since I’m part Ukrainian, and I happen to think Eastern European girls are pretty cute, it didn’t take us long before we wer down there having a few drinks. Good news is that cute Ukrainian liked me, so she took my number and wants to go for lunch this week..

Tommorow night is [Mel’s big Halloween Bash](http://www.2bitstudios.com). I hope I can figure out a costume before it starts!
