Wow, that seems like a title from 24. Anyways, Ryland Haggis was by tonight for a few beers, which was definitely cool, since we’ve been talking about it for a while now. For those of you who don’t know Ryland, he’s an extremely talented photographer who also happens to be an amazing bass player — he’s currently in [Jessie Farrell](http://www.jessiefarrell.com)‘s band, and has been touring with her this last year.
