So tonight Jeff and Michele invited me over to their place for dinner. It seems that lately everyone is cooking for me, which is really cool, because I just am not in the mood for cooking lately. I’ve been really tired lately, and I end up sleeping most of my free time. After dinner at Jeff’s, I was sitting on their couch admiring their new 40 some inch LCD screen, when I woke up about 30 minutes later while a movie was playing. I guess I had just passed out.

What’s kind of cool is that I think I’m going to get to be in Jeff’s wedding party — again.

You see, they got married in Costa Rica a few years ago, but I guess for some reason the paperwork went missing, or the guy who performed the ceremony took the cash and ran. Nobody is really sure the reason, but I guess after two years of trying to get some indication they were actually married they are just going to go ahead and redo it here. Which is cool, because I had a lot of fun at their wedding the first time, so the second time has got to be even better.
