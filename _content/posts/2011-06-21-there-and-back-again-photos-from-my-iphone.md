I pulled about 6 GB worth of photos from my phone the other day, most of which were taken from my four month adventure in South America, New York City and Europe. The photos aren’t as high quality as the ones from my SLR or my EPL-2, but they still represent a portion of my trip that brings back fond memories.

Here’s the slideshow for your viewing pleasure. I recommended clicking the fullscreen button in the bottom right and then clicking “Show Info” in the top right to view the captions.
