Rebecca is only a few hours away from crossing the half-way point for blogathon. 100% of the contributions she receives will be going to the Surrey Food Bank — it’s not too late to [head over to her site](http://www.miss604.com) and drop a few dollars to support a good cause.

I contributed a guest post on her website for the 3pm blog entry — [you can check it out here](http://www.miss604.com/2007/07/tired-of-flyers-in-your-mailbox.html).
