![Leaves](_images/free-falling-1.jpg)

Time comes, time goes. Yesterday was June, and today’s September. No fierce battles, only casualties. Last night I picked up a nice steak and threw it on the BBQ. Half way through cooking I ran out of propane. First time in two years that’s happened. I guess change is floating in the air these days, little wisps of something else to do, somewhere else to be. The leaves will fall soon, and then the rain, and then the snow. Turn a few more weathered pages in the book and it’ll be June again. Wash, rinse, repeat. It’s cold in here – grab the axe and help chop down another few years for the fire.

I miss the autumn. Not the autumn we get out here, but the ones out east, with splashes of color and brisk air that can blow it all away. Long walks with nothing on my mind, nowhere to be, nothing to fix or do. Lost a long time ago, but still remembered. A pile of leaves long since blown asunder.
