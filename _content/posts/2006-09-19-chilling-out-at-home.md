So, I’m all over this “chilling out at home” thing. I’ve spent the last few nights just pittering around my apartment, drinking coffee, and listening to music. Hell, I even cooked my own dinner tonight (it wasn’t very good though). I feel a lot better now that I’ve had a few good nights of sleep, even though I could still use a bit more.

I rediscovered some panorama software on my computer, and decided to try and stich a few together. Here’s is a stich of a few shots from my apartment this weekend. Sean asked me to try one at night, so I’ll do that soon too.

On another note — does anyone have high definition at home? Is it just me, or does the HD programming royally suck? I’m always excited when I watch something in HD, but I’m so sick of watching the news of some weird animal kingdom program. Why can’t I see Lord of the Rings in HD or something arguably cooler?
