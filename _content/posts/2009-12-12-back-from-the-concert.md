It was a great show, and I’ve just started processing all the photos. You can check out the full set [over on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanestorey/sets/72157622859546165/). I still have a lot more to put up, but I’m beat so I’m hitting the sack.

My favourite shot so far is this one of Kathleen Higgins.

Not sure why I like it, but I just do.
