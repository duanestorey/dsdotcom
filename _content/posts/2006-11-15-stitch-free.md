I had the ones on my head out today, so I’m officially stitch free. Whoo hoo!

Here’s a photo of myself I took tonight using my cell phone. Although my eye is still a bit wonky, it’s a pretty big improvement over where I was a week ago.

Once my eye improves, I think I’ll work on figuring out how to put my glasses on straight.
