I took this on my way home tonight, using the nearest garbage can as a makeshift tripod.

Also, tonight Jason, Sheila, Cisco, Michele, Ralph and myself went out to [Cru](http://www.cru.ca) restaurant on Broadway. We ordered a pile of appetizers, and a couple bottles of wine. My favourite I think was the cheese platter, but the smoked tuna was really tasty as well.
