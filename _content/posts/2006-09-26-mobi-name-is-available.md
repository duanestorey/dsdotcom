I was reading about this this morning. Apparently landmark registrations for .mobi names begins today.. I thought about getting duanestorey.mobi, but considering not a lot of people look at my website from a **normal PC**, I don’t think many people are going to from a mobile phone.. I tried briefly to get google.mobi, but alas, it’s already taken 🙁
