I quickly stopped by Future Shop on my way home tonight and picked up a brand new power supply for my server at home. They had a really nice (that is, if power supplies can be described as such) $150 one that was on sale for $75, so I went with that. The good news is that my old power supply was basically taxed in terms of connectors, and it would have been impossible to add anything else to it. This new one has an extra 300W of headroom on it, and also 3 more SATA connectors.

To be honest, I wasn’t even really sure it was the power supply, but it seemed like a pretty reasonable guess. The good news is I replaced it in about 15 minutes, and as you can see, we’re up and running again.

Sorry for the little blip in the service there. If you haven’t filled out the survey in my previous post, make sure you [head on over](http://www.migratorynerd.com/2008/07/want-to-win-a-nintendo-wii) and make yourself eligible for a free Nintendo Wii. I didn’t get a whole lot of sleep last night, so yours truly is going to curl up on the couch and have a nap.
