Friday afternoon I logged into my myspace account after a long absence and, after debating about it for about 3 seconds, deleted my account entirely. It’s not like it caused me any headache or anything, but I just don’t use it really at all anymore and don’t have time to maintain that and my facebook account. So, after searching around for a while, I managed to find the “Delete Account” button and forever put it into the trash.

Anyone else actually still use myspace, or has everyone migrated to Facebook now?

Also, a few people have been tracking my new blog entries with twitter – if you have twitter, you can add me by somehow visiting here -&gt; http://twitter.com/duanestorey
