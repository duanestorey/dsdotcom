Well, I can honestly say that as much as I like travelling, it sure is nice to be back home. Leaving my home city always makes me appreciate it more when I get back home. Von was a great time, but I’m looking forward to relaxing and catching up on sleep for the next few days.. I just got back from the mall where I bought a bunch of new clothes (winter’s coming after all). I also picked up the new John Mayer CD (Continuum), and have been listening to it. It’s pretty mellow, but it’s actually really good. His concert is coming up next week here in Vancouver.

Here’s a shot from my patio a few minutes ago.
