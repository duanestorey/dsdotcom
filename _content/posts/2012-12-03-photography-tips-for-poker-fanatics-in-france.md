Poker is not only fantastically interesting and thrilling to watch live, but it also makes an excellent scene for artsy photography. As a keen poker player and photographer, you might be interested in finding out how you can merge two of your hobbies together.

Slow Shutter Speed – Begin by setting your camera to the manual setting as this allows you to adjust everything from the shutter speed to the aperture. If you’re playing poker indoors, then increase your ISO to around 1000 as this will let more light in. Sometimes players will flip their poker chips and catch them – this makes a really cool photo especially if it’s shot using a slow shutter speed. The flying chip will be a blur in the air but the player will be in focus – this makes very artistic and eye catching photo.

Shallow Depth of Field – As the game progresses, the best players piles of chips will get bigger. Try photographing piles of chips using a shallow depth of field. This arty effect will focus on the chips closest to the lens and gradually blur out the ones in the background. Shallow depth of field photos are best achieved when using a fixed pancake lens like a 25mm or 30mm lens.

Editing – As you know, poker chips are bold and brightly colored. Make sure you bring out these colors when you are editing your photos by increasing the saturation and enhancing the contrast levels.
