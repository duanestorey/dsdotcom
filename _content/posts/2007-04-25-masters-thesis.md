I’ve had a few requests lately from people asking if I could send them a copy of my master’s thesis. So in the interest of saving time, I’m throwing it up here in case anyone wants to download it and read themselves to sleep.

My research was primarily in the area of high definition video compression, specifically on a new codec called H.264 that is used in the new HD DVD formats such as [Blue-Ray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc) and [HD-DVD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_DVD). I proposed a novel scheme to combine concurrently broadcoast MPEG-2 standard definition (SD) streams with H.264 spatial difference information to create a HD broadcast stream at a reduced bitrate.

So, [here it is](http://www.migratorynerd.com/DuaneStorey_Thesis.pdf). Enjoy.
