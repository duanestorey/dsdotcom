Ok Mac guys, please don’t kill me. But for you windows people, I’m trying to figure out who has the .NET framework installed on their machine. Using some javascript trickery I’ll populate this box below with information regarding whether or not you have .NET installed. **If you’re on Windows, please visit this page using IE.**

Can everyone please answer the poll answers after reading this post. Thanks.



For you Windows users, the box will have something like this in it:

“Windows, IE  
.NET CLR 1.1.4322,.NET CLR 2.0.50727,.NET CLR 3.0.04506.30,.NET CLR 3.0.04506.648”

That means you are running Internet Explorer, and you have version 1, version 2 and version 3 of .NET installed. In that case, please add three entries for the poll at the bottom (you can pick more than one).

\[poll id=”13″\]
