Today is my sister and brother-in-law’s 15th wedding anniversary. Hard to believe really, since I vividly remember being at their wedding years ago and doing the chicken dance over and over. It was a nice little wedding, right up at Cultus Lake, in a tiny little community hall that held around 80 people. In true Ukrainian fashion, the bar was completely open (a definite requirement for when I get married — I’m willing to compromise on everything else, but the bar has to be open).

The wedding photos were across the road and on the edge of the lake. So this afternoon I’m going to be heading up with my camera, and taking a few new shots of them in the same spot, 15 years later. In addition, there will be a few shots with my niece and nephew, two happy additions to the family over the years.
