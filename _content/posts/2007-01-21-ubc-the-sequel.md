So tonight Joe called me and told me to head down to Au Bar for Ben’s Sister’s Engagement Party. I didn’t really have much to do, so I thought it would be a lot of fun.

It was really cool seeing some of the old guys from UBC — Joe, Balhar, Ben.. All of us used to be a bunch of dorky guys in 1995 at Totem Park, and now we’ve all done pretty good for ourselves.. So it’s a lot of fun seeing everyone again. Joe and Jane are getting married soon, so it should be a really fun party.
