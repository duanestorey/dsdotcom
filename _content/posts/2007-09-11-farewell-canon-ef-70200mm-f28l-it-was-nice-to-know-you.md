I got a call from Canon today about my lens with water vapour in it. They verdict: completely unfixable.

To be honest, I’m a bit pissed off. When I shipped it out to them, I followed it up with a call telling them it was rather urgent, and they needed to get to it first since it concerned water damage. The lady on the phone told me they were 5 days behind, and there was nothing she could do. Anyways, when they finally get to it, it was corroded inside and not worth fixing.

The replacement cost of the new lens is around $1600, so I’m going to be submitting my first ever insurance claim. The shitty part is that I have special insurance on all my camera equipment, except of course that lens since it’s rather recent. Had anything else bit the dust, I would have been able to get a new one without any deductible at all.

My main concern right now is that I have a wedding to shoot in 3 weeks, and that lens is part of it. I can always rent one, but I’m hoping insurance doesn’t take forever to get the cash to me so I can go grab a new one. We’ll see
