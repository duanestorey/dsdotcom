I’ve been attending an IPTV conference here in Vancouver for the last day or so. Definitely some interesting stuff coming out of here. The main goal of this conference is to make sure everyone can work with each other’s equipment, but the devil is in the details. Lots of different approaches to Digital Rights Management (DRM), media transport, and session establishment.

I went out for a while with Chris, Derek and Cisco last night, hopping between SoHo (Yaletown), Milestones and the Granville Room. Not a very late night by CounterPath standards, but fun anyways. I’ll post some photos later when I’m at home.
