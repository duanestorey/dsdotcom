Eight easy steps:

1\. Toss and turn all night  
2\. Fall asleep at 5am  
3\. Get up at 9:30am and try to head to work  
4\. Call a cab, and tell him to take you to work  
5\. Pay cab driver. Drop money all over the cab and look dumb.  
6\. Exit cab and close door, making sure to slam your iPod touch in the door  
7\. Stand there looking at iPod touch drive away with cab driver, only to fall off a half block away  
8\. Pick up iPod touch on the concrete, now without headphones
