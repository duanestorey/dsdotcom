I took a quick break this afternoon from work and decided to hash out a quick WordPress plugin that would push my blog entries into my Twitter feed. The end result is [WordTwit](http://www.migratorynerd.com/wordtwit), and itâ€™s available for download if anyone wants to try it on their WordPress blog.

Drop me a comment or two and let me know what you think.
