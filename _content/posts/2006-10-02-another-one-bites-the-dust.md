For the last few months, I’ve been telling everyone just how wicked the TV show “24” was. I got hooked a few months ago on the show at Jason’s recommendation, and spent about two weeks straight on the couch watching episode after episode until I finished all four seasons. I’m eagerly waiting for season 5 to come out on DVD so I can kiss another full weekend goodbye watching it.

When my dad was in the hospital, Cathy rented the first four episodes of season one for him. I tried to talk to him online tonight and he was like “sorry, gotta go, episode 13 just started.” That’s 13 episodes in about 48 hours, which is nearly as good as my record with that show.

Way to go Jack Bauer — you’ve destroyed yet another social life.
