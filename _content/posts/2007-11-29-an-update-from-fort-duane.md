Yesterday I didn’t really have much time to blog, and I doubt I will today either. I’ve just been a bit busy with everything.

Looking outside right now, it looks like there’s an official snow line in the mountains around downtown, which probably means skiing and snowboarding will start soon. It’s a fairly nice day in Vancouver (in fact, it’s been really nice this winter so far), and you can check out a live feed if you want at [KatKam.ca](http://katkam.ca):

That camera is about one block from my apartment. What else is new. Well, I’m still feeling a bit under the weather in terms of my health. Tomorrow is a little party at work, followed by hanging out with [John](http://audihertz.net/blog) and [Rebecca](http://miss604.com) for a while. A I haven’t pulled my camera out really for a few weeks, so I’m looking forward to snapping a few photos before I rust from lack of use.

Sunday I may try to sort things out around home, pay some bills, and finally get XP running on my iMac at home. Should be a busy weekend.
