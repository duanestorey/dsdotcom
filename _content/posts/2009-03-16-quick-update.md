On Thursday I’m getting on a plane and heading out to Hamilton for a few days prior to heading down to the Mayan Riviera. I have a lot of things to get off my plate before then, and am hoping to even hit the mall at some point to do a bit of shopping. My laptop has been down in Vancouver getting fixed, and hopefully I’ll be getting it back tonight (that’s a whole blog post in itself). I have to say that not having a laptop around has been a total pain in the rear end. Tomorrow I plan to work from a coffee shop again, as I find it’s a really nice atmosphere (and the scenery is a bit better as well!)

I have a haircut tomorrow morning so I should be good to go for the Mayan Riviera adventure. Other than sit around the pool bar and sip beer, I really don’t have any grand adventures for Cancun. I’ll probably check out some of the ruins one day, and I wouldn’t mind renting a scooter and exploring a bit. I’m going to hit Coles or Chapters before I leave and buy a pile of books as well, as I’m really looking forward to lounging around the pool and reading a bit during the days.
