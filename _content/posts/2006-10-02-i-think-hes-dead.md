I read this link tonight, and it reminded me of my friend Jeff’s cousin who died while running from the police in California (not sure why he ran, but the police didn’t really seem to care — they just shot him a few times and he stopped running). Now the guy in this article I just read \*was suspected\* of killing a cop, but seriously: did they really need to shoot him 68 times?

Here’s a great quote:  
“I suspect the only reason 110 rounds was all that was fired was that’s all the ammunition they had,” Judd said. “We were not going to take any chance of him shooting back.”
