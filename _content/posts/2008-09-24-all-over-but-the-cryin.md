Just got back from my appointment this morning. Some lady spent 20 minutes giving me impromtu eye tests, and measuring my face and eye positions. There’s one tool they use to measure eye displacement which is actually slightly painful because they force it to sit on the edge of your eye socket and press it there. Unfortunately, my left orbital bone is slightly out of place so it’s hard to get an accurate measurement using that device.

Anyways, once I finally talked to the surgeon, he basically indicated that another surgery at this stage is probably too risky. He said even though the end result isn’t completely ideal, given the magnitude of the original injury, he thinks the end result is fairly successful. There are small cosmetic revisions they can make if I want, but I really don’t think I want to go down that route.

So that’s it I guess. Not sure if I’m relieved or disappointment. I’m just kind of numb to it all at this stage. But at least there are no more surgeries on the horizon.
