I set up a small photography website over at [photography.duanestorey.com](http://photography.duanestorey.com) a while ago. I think I’m going to over haul it this weekend and make it a bit better. I also want to get a domain name for it and make it a proper stand-alone site. If anyone has any ideas for a cool name for a photography site, fire me off an email. I’ve been trying to come up with west-coast oriented names, but so far no go.

I’ll give a free 8×12 print and a blog entry on the new site for the person that picks the winner!

Thanks!
