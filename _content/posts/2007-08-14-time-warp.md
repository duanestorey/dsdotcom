A few years ago, I was the best man in my friend Jeff’s wedding. One of the responsibilities of the best man, as you probably know, is to organize the stag and to get the groom insanely drunk. I didn’t do anything amazing crazy for Jeff, but I did organize a big drinking pub crawl with some of his friends around town.

I also bought a bunch of disposable cameras and distributed them to all the people attending, hoping that we would get some great shots of the event. After I got home that night (and I can’t honestly remember how I got home), I ended up with a plastic bag of disposible cameras, which I promptly put on a shelf to be dealt with later. Unfortunately, one month became two, and two became four, and that bag of cameras sat collecting dust on a shelf for the better part of two years.

So this morning, upon seeing it in my laundry room, I decided to finally do something about them. I walked by Custom Colour on my way into work and dropped off a few of the cameras, along with two rolls I’ve shot with my new digital body (one of which is on slide film, which I’ve never shot before). So, Thursday I’ll get to see just how much fun we had two years ago at Jeff’s stag. Should be rather interesting I imagine.
