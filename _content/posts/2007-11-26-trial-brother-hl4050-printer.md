So a while ago [Darren posted on his blog that Brother was looking for a few west coast bloggers to potentially review a printer or two](http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/2007/11/any-western-canadian-bloggers-want-to-test-drive-a-printer.html). Considering I take a ton of photos and ultimately end up printing a pile of them out, I thought it might be a good opportunity to test out a fairly nice printer from Brother.

Well, this big boy showed up at work today, and once I figure out just how in the world I’m going to get it home, I’ll test it out and see what it can do. I plan to try printing out a bunch of my artwork to see how it performs in that capacity, as well as a few other tests with the card readers.

Thanks to Darren for getting this going.
