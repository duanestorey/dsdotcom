I went out with a few friends last night, which was fun. I ran into my good friend Kasia at the bar, which was pretty cool.

It also reminded me how much I’m going to miss all the people I’ve gotten to know in Vancouver. But hopefully I’ll be out here from time to time, or people will come visit me once and a while.

Only a few more days. Still looking forward to it. Gotta start packing soon though.
