Amanda called me last night and asked if I wanted to go to the Vancouver Aquarium with her, Andie and the kids. She had a free ticket, so I thought it would be fun. Traffic was a bitch getting to and from the Aquarium, but we all had fun while we were there. Iâ€™m thinking about maybe playing tennis tomorrow, and finally getting around to cleaning up my apartment.
