Well, I am officially 31, and I feel old. Tonight, Keira, Amy, John and Rebecca came by and spent the night eating nachos and watching Apple TV with me. I easily had over 100 messages between email and Facebook related to my birthday, which considering where I was last year, is totally amazing and completely appreciated. You guys are all awesome.

On the plane today I ran into my old high school friend, Laura Street, and we spent the flight chatting about old times. I think there’s a camping trip in Banff on the horizon for all of us. But until then, thanks so much.

Tomorrow I’ll write about all the Junos stuff I haven’t talked about yet! But until then, thanks to everyone who took a few minutes out of their day and wished me a happy birthday.
