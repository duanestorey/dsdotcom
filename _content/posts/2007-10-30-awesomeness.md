So it’s not very often something can make me bust out loud laughing, but this did the trick. I’m a closet Star Trek nerd, and used to sit around and watch episodes with my dad growing up. One of my favorites is when Kirk takes sand and rocks and shit and blows up that Godzilla looking guy on that weird planet. He’s that good.

I found this photo on Christie’s facebook page, and she told me it was cool to blog it. This thing still cracks me up every time I see it.

\*\* Update, the green Godzilla looking thing is a Gorn. Thanks guys.
