Well, tonight I completed the update procedure, which went off with out a hitch. I’m currently back to 10.4.8, and so far so good. I’m not sure if I’ll upgrade to 10.4.10, or wait for Leopard to come out next week and grab that. We’ll see.

I also spent a bit of time talking to the Lacie drive support guys today. They basically said the drive was hooped and to take it back to Future Shop. So tonight, I went down, returned the Lacie drive, but instead of getting the same one, grabbed an LG drive (which said it didn’t support Mac). I figured it was more money, and I had all the system software installed for the Lacie version, so in theory it should just work. Good news is I was right — Lightscribe and burning both work on it, so I’m good to go.
