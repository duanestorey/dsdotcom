I read a few articles last night on what 2008 holds in terms of new movies. Most of the list was fairly yawn-inducing for me (even though they author was clearly excited about them), but a few stood out. The movie 21, for example, about six MIT students who battled Vegas, seems fairly cool, even though I’m sure they’ve completed deviated from the real story.

Check it out. Also on the list was the new Star Trek movie, which is essentially a prequel for the original series. To be honest, I have a hard time thinking that one is really going to fly. I’ll be down there on opening night with the other geeks and my bag of popcorn, just to see the Enterprise sail through the skies one more time, but I’m pretty sure it’s going to suck.
