Welcome everyone the Blogathon 2009! Over the next 24 hours, I will be consuming insane amounts of caffeine while writing blog entries in an effort to generate some exposure and hopefully a bit of financial support for the charity of my choosing, the BC Children’s Hospital Foundation.

I can’t imagine many things worse in this world then being a parent and watching your child get sick. The BC Children’s Hospital is known Canada wide for the work they do with children, which is why I’ve chosen it this year as my charity of choice.

I decided on the way to Workspace this morning that I was going to try to also post at least one photo an hour, showing what Blogathon was like from my perspective. So without further ado, here’s a photo of my view for Blogathon:
