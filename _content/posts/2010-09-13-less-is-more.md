I got on the scale this morning, and I’m down about 11 pounds since the beginning of summer. I’ve actually been in a steady decline since the start of the year, mainly because I’ve been pretty careful about what I’m eating. I’ve also forced myself to go to the gym a few times a week as well, tossing in the odd yoga class whenever I have some evening time available.

My goal is to be down 30 pounds before I leave in January, which would basically put me at the weight I was back when I used to play sports and what not. Still got a ways to go, but with the rain and lack of patio beer-drinking engagements, it should be a lot easier going forward.
