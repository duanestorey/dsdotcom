I normally have an immune system of steel. Not only is it pretty rare that I get sick, but when I do it normally doesn’t last too long. In fact, I don’t think I’ve taken more than three sick days in my entire life, and one of them was faked way back in high school.

However, I am now officially a full week into being sick with seem weird virus, and while I no longer seem to be getting worse, I’ve been stuck at the “pretty darn sick” alert level for a few days now, and it’s getting tiresome. I wake up each morning hoping that I’ll take a deep breath without coughing, but that just doesn’t seem to be happening.

When I left San Francisco, I was hoping that I wouldn’t have gotten my hosts down there sick, however it appears that not only is Jason now really sick, but so is his wife, which obviously sucks. Maybe I picked up some weird Las Vegas hump-alot virus or something crazy that you can only get while walking the strip at 1am, I have no idea. But I really hope it starts to clear up soon while I still have enough Kleenix and toilet paper around to combat it.

In other news, I’m meeting up with a group of people in a few hours to watch the new Transformers Movie — very exciting. I’m bringing my little camera (which I just found a few minutes ago, wedged tightly down inside of my couch), so I’ll try and post a few pics later.
