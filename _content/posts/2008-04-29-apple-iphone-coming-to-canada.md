It’s official — Roger’s has made what they call a public statement regarding just that:

> TORONTO, April 29 /CNW/ – Ted Rogers, President and Chief Executive  
> Officer of Rogers Communications Inc. today issued the following statement:  
>  We’re thrilled to announce that we have a deal with Apple to bring the  
> iPhone to Canada later this year. We can’t tell you any more about it right  
> now, but stay tuned.

Not very informative, but I guess it dispels the myth that it’s not coming. Although, most people thought it would get here eventually. I also read that Rogers is testing out a $20 unlimited data plan as well, which would make sense.
