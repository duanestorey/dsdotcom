I have almost exactly one month until my 30th birthday, and I’m going to try and make a few changes for the month leading up to it. As I mentioned in an earlier posting, as of tonight, I’m going to try and get a good night’s sleep and wake up early during the week. That means bedtime for me tonight at 11pm, and up at 7am. I’m gonna shift my work schedule a bit so I’m home a bit earlier in the evenings. And get this, I’m even gonna go for a run in the morning. Also, although it’s going to be hard, I’m gonna abstain from drinking until my birthday and give my liver a chance to recouperate. Hopefully I’ll be able to save some a little cash and to spend a bit more time at home.

March is gonna be a bit busy, but then hopefully things will die down a bit…
