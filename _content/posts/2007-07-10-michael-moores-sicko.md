So I actually managed to watch a copy of Michael Moore’s new movie, “Sicko”, a few weeks ago. In short, it’s a really powerful emotional argument for why the United States should move to a socialized health care system. Unlike some of his other movies, he doesn’t spend a lot of time quoting facts or statistics, which for some people might lead to a less effective argument. But considering most of the statistics can be found by spending a few minutes on the Internet, and Michael Moore is probably trying to appeal to the everyman, I think it’s a fairly effective movie. Darren Barefoot [also has a detailed review of the movie](http://darrenbarefoot.com/archives/2007/06/sicko-is-moore-at-his-best-and-worst.html) on his blog if you want to take a look.

After watching Sicko, I immediately began to think about what I had been through in the last eight months, my two surgeries, the hospital visits, etc, and it made me very appreciative that not only did I not have to pay for any of it, but I also didn’t have any of the emotional stress associated with worrying about any of it. When I had my second surgery, I walked into Vancouver General Hospital, slid my Care Card across the table, and that was that. It’s hard for me to even imagine a system that isn’t like that, and my heart goes out to families that have medical misfortune and are forced to endure that type of system.

Since it’s release, I’ve been watching the media response to ‘Sicko’. A few weeks ago, Michael Moore was scheduled to have an interview inside the New York Stock Exchange. However, upon arriving there, he wasn’t allowed inside the buildilng. You can watch that clip here:

  
  
During the premiere that Hillary Clinton attended, she reportedly [walked out the moment the scene came up where she was accused of selling her campaign out](http://beginnorth.com/blog/?p=82). And last night, Michael Moore appeared on CNN and bashed Wolfe Blitzer about his treatment of Sicko as well as CNN’s handling of the Iraq war. You should definitely check it out:

  
  
It’s well known in my circles that if you want unbiased reporting that you don’t watch CNN, and it’s unfortunate that they continue to distort the facts for their own agenda.

In response to the CNN footage with Dr. Gupta, Michael Moore [has put a statement out on his blog detailing the inaccuracies](http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko/news/article_10017.php). He ever goes as far to say some of it is libel:

> CNN: “But no matter how much Moore fudged the facts, and he did fudge some factsâ€¦”
> 
> This is libel. There is not a single fact that is “fudged” in the film. No one has proven a single fact in the film wrong. We expect CNN to correct their mistakes on the air and to apologize to their viewers

Also, Michael Moore will be on Larry King live tonight with Dr. Sanjay Gupta, so definitely check it out.
