I was originally going to spend my day at home researching some stats for my upcoming presentation. Since it’s such a nice day though I decided to come up to the lake and casually drink a bit of rum while working on it instead. I suspect that this is one of the last weekends where it’ll be this warm, so might as well take advantage of it while it’s here.

I just got confirmation about a pretty cool little video clip I’ll hopefully be able to include in my WordCamp PDX presentation, so that should be fun. Other than that, I’m just gonna keep plugging away at everything. I’m hoping most of it will be done tonight, which leaves me the remainder of the week to slowly modify it and do a trial run or two. I also need to come up with a demo script for some of the live demos I want to give.

Other than that, business as usual. I’m sure hoping that the weather holds for a week or two – it sure is nice to sit in the sunshine again.
