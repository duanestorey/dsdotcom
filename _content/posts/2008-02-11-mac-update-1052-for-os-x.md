For all of you who have been waiting patiently for the new 10.5.2 update, the wait is over. 10.5.2 is now available on software update. Iâ€™m installing all 350 MB of it right now.

For all of you about to update, I salute you.

Oh, and for all you people on shitty broadband, you should know I just downloaded 352 MB in 4 minutes here.
