So, I haven’t really listened to too much of their music, but I’ve been told that it’s unusually cool. Last night I was doing some shopping down at Pacific Center, and while crossing from one side of the mall to the other, I nearly walked into Jack Black. At first I wasn’t really sure it was him, but after doing a double take, I was pretty certain. He had his baby in a stroller and was just walking around checking stuff out.

I went home and Googled to see if that was him in town, and sure enough, he has a [Vancouver concert tonight](http://www.ticketmaster.ca/artist/807254/?search_redirect=tenacious%20d&tm_link=tm_header_search). So, if you’re a fan, you might want to check it out.
