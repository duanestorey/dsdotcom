I went to the Compact Sports Car show at BC Place stadium today with Brennen and Dave. I had never been to a car show before, if you can really call it that. The focus seems to be more on the car-models than the cars themselves. It was a pretty good time though, and I got lots of cool shots with Dave and Brennen.
