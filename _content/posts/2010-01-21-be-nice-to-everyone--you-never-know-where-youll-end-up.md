As most people know, I moved back to Chilliwack (a small farming community, where I grew up) last year. Recently I’ve begun looking at houses in Chilliwack and decided to solicit the help of a realtor.

I obviously had a lot of choices, but I homed in on one. My mom was in real-estate years ago, and she said very few people were very nice to her except for one guy. That guy went out of his way to be nice to her when she was starting out, and was the only person who helped her career instead consistently.

So, nearly 20 years later, I called that guy up and told him that based on how he treated my mom a long time ago, I was his guy. And since then, I’ve had awesome service that I totally trust. So, never underestimate the value of treating someone right – you never know when it’ll catch up with you.
