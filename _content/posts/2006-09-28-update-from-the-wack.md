Today is hopefully the day that my dad gets to go home from the ICU in Chilliwack. He went into New West. yesterday for angioplasty, and the initial word is that the surgery was a complete success. He’s got another 50 years of camping with the current hardware now. I spoke to him last night in the hospital via phone and he’s relieved and obviously happy to be going home.
