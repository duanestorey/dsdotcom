Last night Hesty and I tried a different view point for the fireworks. My camera was being a bit dumb, and I didn’t end up with many shots, but here’s one I rather liked.

And thanks to [Tony](http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/bloggy.htm) for the link love, much appreciated. I hope your balls feel better soon, man.
