My iMac has been a bit slow when using photoshop or garageband, so today, after picking up Hesty from the airport, I stopped at NCIX and picked up some more memory for it.

When I got home, I actually had a hard time figuring out just where the memory went. I finally found out where — there’s a little panel on the very bottom of the iMac that comes off easily with one screw. After that, you just slide in the SODIMM chip and you’re up and running again in just a few minutes. Pretty slick, especially compared to how much trouble it was to upgrade the Mac Mini at work (I actually had to use a cheese slicer to pry that thing open).
