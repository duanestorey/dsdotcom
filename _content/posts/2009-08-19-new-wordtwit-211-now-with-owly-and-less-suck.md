We just did a quick update to [WordTwit](http://www.bravenewcode.com) to include support for the Ow.ly service, and also fixed a few old bugs (the most important of which is the weird one involving encoded characters in the update message). The WordPress repository is updated, so you should see it shortly.

That is all.
