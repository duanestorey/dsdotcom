Well, as you can see, I’ve started making changes to this website. They are far from done, but I think I’ve made enough headway to put it back up for a while. Here’s what I have done so far:

1. Made a new theme, borrowing a few elements from the “default” wordpress theme
2. Added a custom flickr plugin that has read/write access to my flickr account
3. Added the ability to associate abritrary images or sets from flickr with any blog entry. These images can be viewed using the ImageBox javascript library

I’ve associated my HDR set with this blog entry just so you can get an idea of how it works. Tomorrow I’m going to revise all the content, and work on integrating flickr photo comments into the main wordpress comment system. I scoped this out tonight and it’s alot harder than I originally thought, but we’ll see.

I’m also going to add a slider or two to alter the look and feel of the website on the fly. At least, that’s the plan. It might turn out to be a stupid idea, but I’m gonna test it out. If you have any comments on the new look and feel, let me know. I’m really curious how it looks on a mac, since I don’t have access to one.
