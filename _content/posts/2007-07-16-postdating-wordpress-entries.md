So I found out something pretty cool on Friday night with WordPress. It was around 11pm and I wanted to put a new post up but have the date say the next day at 1 minute past midnight. The idea being that I could post Saturday’s photo of the day Friday night before I went to bed. However, once I modified the timestamp in WordPress and published the article, it didn’t show up at all, which I thought a bit odd at first.

However, after reading through the documentation, WordPress has the ability to schedule posts in the future. That is, whenever the timestamp of the post is in the future, it is put into a queue for automatic publishing when the time is reached.

That’s a really cool feature, and it will make it easy to add several photos of the day in advance if I ever go away for a few days and don’t have access to a computer.
