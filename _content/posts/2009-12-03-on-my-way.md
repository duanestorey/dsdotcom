I’m currently at the Punta Cana airport doing a quick entry on my iPhone. John and Rebecca just got here and apparenly Rebecca has free drink tickets to a bar here. So I imagine we will probably have a few drinks before boarding.

Dale has one more day on the resort, and then he’s heading home. Not exactly ideal, but it was hard to align Vancouver and Toronto with the flights. We all had a really great time on the resort and forged a few new great memories.

I am however looking forward to sleeping in my own bed tonight, and going for a little drive in my car tomorrow. I’ll spend this weekend just getting back into the groove again and slowly letting my Cuban paint job fade.
