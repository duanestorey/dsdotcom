I met my friend [Keira-Anne](http://keira-anne.com) for a quick lunch down at Pacific Center a while ago, and then hit the mall hard on a quest to buy some clothes. I rarely shop for clothes, not because I don’t like buying clothes, but because I’m really picky and always end up leaving frustrated.

Since I only had 45 minutes, I decided to be less picky and just go with the flow. I ended up buying two pairs of nice jeans, and a few cool shirts for the weekend. Pretty much everything I bought was on sale, but it still ended up being around $400 after tax. Not bad for 45 minutes of work.

I have so much to do tonight it’s not even funny. I have to charge all my camera gear, finish getting my blog ready, do some laundry, go grab some podcasting equipment from [John Bollwitt](http://johnbollwitt.com), call my friends in Calgary, and somehow get enough sleep so I can walk straight during the press conference tomorrow. Urban Vancouver is setting up a Junos aggregator, so hopefully that will be set up tomorrow. Make sure you check both sites during the weekend, since I’m going to be posting on both. I’ll cross post from time to time, but will try to keep the content separate when I can.
