I haven’t been sleeping very good lately, and as a result, I tend to be awake at weird hours.. Take this morning for example — up at 6am, even though I typically don’t get into work until 9:30am. So, I’ve just been killing time on the computer, reading articles, taking a few photos, and working a bit on my thesis defense presentation. It’s funny because even though I consider myself a night person, I always like getting up at this hour — it makes your day seem so much more productive for some reason.

Here’s a shot off my patio a few minutes ago:
