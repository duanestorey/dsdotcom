It’s here, Northern Voice 2008. Tonight is the big social down at the Tiki Lounge in East Vancouver. I’ll be heading down with [Rebecca](http://miss604.com), [John](http://johnbollwitt.com), and [Keira](http://keira-anne.com) for some drinks and a full roast-pig. I still haven’t figured out what I’m going to say at PhotoCamp, but I’ll spend some time thinking about it during the day and see what I can come up with.

I went to the mall to pick out some new clothes tonight, but turns out I’m just way too picky. I’ve decided that next time I need to bring a girl or two with me to help me spend some money.

I’m hoping to see a lot of people out at PhotoCamp, or walking around the conference. If you see me, make sure you pull me aside and say hi. I’ll take a bunch of photos tomorrow and post them when I get home.
