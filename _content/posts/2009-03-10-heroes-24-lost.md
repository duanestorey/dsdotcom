Now that I have cable again, I’ve been watching a bit more TV. Except for last night’s Heroes and 24, I’ve been keeping up with all three shows.

Of them all, Lost is the only one that’s really keeping me interested. I think the whole concept of 24 has just gone on too long now. I thought season two was pretty awesome, mainly because it focused on character development. Now it’s more of an action flick. They had a good opportunity with that cute FBI agent, but they really haven’t used her to her full potential yet.

I’m not sure why, but I find Heroes pretty boring these days. I guess because everyone and their dog has some super power now, it’s really hard to get worked up when anyone is in danger. I kind of miss the old days when Peter and Sylar were going at it more.

What do you guys think of this year’s season of those shows?
