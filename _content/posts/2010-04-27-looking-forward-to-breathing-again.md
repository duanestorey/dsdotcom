Ever since I’ve moved back to Chilliwack, I’ve been having a lot of sinus headaches and routine problems breathing through my nose. I’ve never really had allergies before (at least, nothing other than an allergy to penicillin ), so I haven’t really known what to do with it all.

While cleaning my office last weekend, I found a few medical reports from my injury in 2006, most notably my first CT scan. While the doctor pointed out the obvious facial fractures, he also made note of [sinusitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis) in both sinuses, something that was never pointed out to me. Regardless, I’ve been taking a lot of allergy pills since moving back here, most of which haven’t really helped all that much. What does seem to help are over the counter nasal sprays, but those are supposed to be pretty bad for you long term.

I decided to go down today to the clinic and get checked out. After explaining everything to the doctor, she took at look up my nose and was surprised and just how swollen my sinuses were. So, needless to say she prescribed nasal corticosteroids for me in the hope it would help reduce the inflammation. Apparently it’ll take up to 3 weeks for full effect, and I can say after one day I don’t really notice much improvement (especially compared to the rapid action of the over the counter sprays), but I’m hoping at some point in the near future I won’t spend most of my days walking around with a plugged up nose. Given how I’ve had sleeping problems on and off over the years, I wonder if the two might possibly be related. I’ll soon find out.
