As you can see, I’ve been trying to push out some of these plugins that have been on my plate for a while. The Media Burner one is now officially in beta.

Media burner automatically extracts media files (MP3, FLV, YouTube, etc) from your blog posts and creates a site-wide player.

The standard WordPress plugin database just fell over, so I have no way to tell the world about this. So if you check the plugin out and like it, please forward the link around or do a blog post about it.

Head on over to the [Media Burner Plugin](http://www.migratorynerd.com/media-burner-media-plugin-for-wordpress/) page for more information. I will probably be moving some of these plugins to a centralized location in the near future, but I want to beta a few of these to get the bugs out before then.
