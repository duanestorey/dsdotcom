When I started redoing my blog about a month ago, I thought it would be cool to add an area where somebody could SMS me if they wanted. That way, if you were on my blog and you wanted to get a hold of me quickly, you could. For some reason, it really did seem like a good idea at the time. However last night, somebody from Spain decided it would be a good idea to SMS me and let me know that my plugin wasn’t working for him. Unfortunately for me, it was about 4am in the morning, and my cell phone was about 4 inches from my head. So, I woke up wondering what in the hell was going on, only to see a big SMS asking how to fix my plugin.

Oh well. Thankfully they can’t take my degree back.
