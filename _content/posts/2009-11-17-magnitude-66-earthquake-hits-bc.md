I actually woke up last night and thought things were shaking a bit, but thought it was due to the wind. Turns out several earthquakes struck off the coast of British Columbia last night, the largest one being a 6.6 on the Richter scale. Iâ€™ve actually experienced a few earthquakes now, one in the lower mainland when I was about 17 years old, and another one when I was visiting Tokyo (which was a bit scary, given that I was on the 37th floor or something and my cell phone was bouncing around on the table due to the quake).

Anyways, you can [read more about it here](http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5g15ulXOjPmDVYqhnpRFSL7SU4AYA).
