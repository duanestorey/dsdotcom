I’m sure many of you know already know who [Leslie Feist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Feist) is. She’s one of Canadian’s most recognized young musicians now, thanks to obvious talent and also having her song 1-2-3-4 included in one of Apple’s largest marketing campaigns.

If I remember correctly, Feist snagged five awards at the Junos, which is as close to a landslide as you can really have at an event like that. I unfortunately didn’t get to meet her (she was rather popular that night), but I did get to hang out a few feet away from her and snap a few photos.

I was doing some reading in my RSS reader this morning and came across this [cute video of Feist](http://purplegables.com) that was recently on Sesame Street over on my friend Kasia’s blog. I used to watch that show a lot as a kid (I’m sure most of us did), and I found myself smiling and counting with the video. So, considering this big kid likes it, I think lots of little ones will as well.

Not only is it a pretty catchy tune, but the video is actually pretty awesome from a technical perspective. You’ll notice that the entire two and a half minutes is essentially one video take. That’s tricky by anyone’s standards, more so given that she’s interacting with puppets throughout the entire piece.

Also, compare the Sesame street video with the video for 1234.

There are some obvious stylistic similarities between the two, which is actually kind of cool that they integrated a few concepts into the Sesame Street piece.

Now I have that song stuck in my head. Hopefully you will too!
