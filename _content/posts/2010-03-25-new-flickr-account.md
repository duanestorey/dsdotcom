I realized last night that I’m sort of envious of the people who only post their best photos to their Flickr stream for the purpose of showcasing work or soliciting opinions on techniques. Given that my current Flickr account is pretty jam packed of personal photos, I thought I would start a second account for mainly my high-quality photos or photos that I’ve taken time to process and enhance.

If you’re interested in following along, the new account is [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanepro/). Feel free to add me as a contact and I’ll add you back. I’m going to challenge myself to try and do a setup shot each week to try and improve some of my techniques. Also, it may help with the occasional boredom that occurs from time to time.
