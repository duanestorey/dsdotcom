Curious to know what happens in the cockpit on French airlines when your dinner is being served? You might have though that the pilots were busy doing complicated fuel calculations, or checking safety systems.

Think again! The stewardesses are coming up from and putting on a little strip show for the pilots. Added union incentives no doubt. Makes me wish I would have gone to pilot school.

  
  
You can read more [about the strip show](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=511677&in_page_id=1811) here. Iâ€™m guessing that lady is in need of a new job.
