After work, I was feeling a bit tired so I laid down for a quick nap. When I woke up a few hours later, not only did I have a wicked headache, most of my joints hurt too. I’ve since turned the heat up in my apartment to around 28C, and I’m still shivering on the couch with some blankets on.

The next couple days are pretty busy for me, so I can’t really afford to be sick. I’m going to head to bed now and hopefully wake up at a reasonable hour. My cute maid is coming again in the morning — so exciting.
