Everyone has a bunch of movies they like to watch over Christmas. Without a doubt, my favourite Christmas movie is actually Die Hard. I love watching Bruce Willis blow stuff up over the holidays. If thereâ€™s a special someone on the couch next to me, Love Actually rates fairly highly as well.

How about you guys? What are your favourite movies to watch over the holidays?
