Hey everyone,

I’ve started a new website called [TapasForever](https://tapasforever.com) detailing my goal for living for a year in Spain. If you’re interested in the journey, or perhaps want to move to Europe for a year or longer in the future, head on over and check it out.

I recommend visiting the [Start Here](https://tapasforever.com/start-here/) page for information on the various resources that will be available. I’m looking forward to getting my visa and checking off a lot of boxes in terms of things I would to accomplish in life (Spanish language, I’m looking at you!).

Cheers,  
Duane
