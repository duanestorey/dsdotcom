Updated – I booked a flight and a hotel for this weekend, so I’ll definitely be at [WordCamp on Saturday](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/08/06/wordcamp-san-francisco-2008/). I love San Francisco, and I’m really looking forward to meeting everyone in the Bay Area. If you see me on Saturday, feel free to flag me down and say hi. Drop a comment if you’ll be there, and I’ll try to find you!

This Saturday is [WordCamp down in San Francisco](http://2008.sf.wordcamp.org/). I registered to attend, although the jury is still out on whether or not I’m going to go. Flights aren’t that expensive to be honest, but accommodation is kind of a killer considering how much traveling I’ve done lately. I’d really like to attend since WordPress is obviously pretty integral in my day to day life, but I’m not sure it’s going to happen unless I can find somewhere cheap to stay for two nights.

Boris is trying to find me something down there, but I thought I might drop a line on my blog to see if anyone might have a floor I can use. I’d probably arrive Friday night if I come down and leave Sunday morning. If you have a line on something, please [drop me a quick email](http://www.migratorynerd.com/contact) or a comment. Thanks.
