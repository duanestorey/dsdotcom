I woke up this morning feeling even worse than I did when I went to bed last night, so I bit the bullet and changed my flight — I’ll be coming home later this evening. If I’m to get any more sick, I definitely want it to be back in Canada where I can hit a clinic up and not have to worry about costs or insurance. I’m pretty sure I have health insurance down here through my work insurance, but I can’t imagine the hassle with trying to actually use it.

My car is at the airport, so I should be all set when I land. It works out well since I have a lens to return to Leo’s camera in Vancouver. Since I worked Monday down here in San Francisco, I’ll be taking tomorrow off back home and simply relaxing. Hopefully I can find a way to beat the SARS and get back on my feet again.

I’m on Alaska Airlines fight 685 out of San Francisco if anyone is interested.
