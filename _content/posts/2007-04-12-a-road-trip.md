For some reason, as this weekend approaches, I find myself yearning to get in the car and simply disappear for a few days.. I’m actually in a really good mood, just with the sun shining and the air warming, I feel like going on a little road trip.

The only problem is that I don’t really want to blow a lot of money. I have no problem camping if I have to, but I’m looking for somewhere to go that’s not more than a three or four hour drive. Anyone have any suggestions?
