We’re getting pretty close to releasing WPtouch 2.0 soon. We haven’t officially set a date, but the release will probably be counted using weeks, and can probably be counted using the fingers on one hand. We’ll hopefully firm that up next week.

Dale wrote a pretty informative post [over on BraveNewCode](http://www.bravenewcode.com/2010/05/the-big-changes-in-wptouch-2-0/), so check it out. In short, we’ll be releasing a very reasonably priced paid version that includes support first, then will eventually roll out another free version using the new codebase. The major addition to WPtouch 2.0 is a new theme framework for creating mobile themes. WPtouch 2.0 will also ship with more than one theme, so that should be an exciting addition for people who use WPtouch.
