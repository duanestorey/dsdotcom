I started playing with a new look and feel for my blog last week, and finished most of it off tonight. I had hacked my other one quite a few times and ended up breaking a few things on it. Hopefully this one will stay lean and mean a little while longer.

I still have to fix up the content on many of the subpages, but the main pages should be working mostly. Iâ€™m also going to be modifying the content to reflect my move out to Chilliwack in a few weeks, and of course going full time with [BraveNewCode](http://www.bravenewcode.com).

I have a few more ideas with regards to showing images and what not, but this is a pretty good start I think.
