My dad sent me this link today: [Oaxaca Crisis](http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/international/ticker/detail/Fox_sends_federal_police_to_Mexico_s_Oaxaca_crisis.html?siteSect=143&sid=7203253&cKey=1162075073000). That’s really near where I’m going in a few weeks. It seems whenever I go somewhere, there’s always some big crisis that happens right before. When I went to Cuba a few years ago, our plane was turned back halfway in the air because of [Hurricane Michelle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Michelle).

Hopefully things get better for the people down in Oaxaca soon.
