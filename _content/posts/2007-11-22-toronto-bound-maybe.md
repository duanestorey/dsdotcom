So I spent about two hours tonight talking to [Tony](http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/bloggy.htm), and I think we both agreed on one thing â€” spending New Years in our own cities was pretty fucking lame. So, right now, weâ€™re both thinking about heading to Toronto for New Yearâ€™s eve, which might be a fairly large mistake for me, Iâ€™m not sure.. To be honest, Iâ€™m not sure Toronto wants to handle me for that long. I need to convince Chad and Danielle to come with me.

But, Iâ€™d love to get out of Vancouver for the holidays and just be me for a while. Not Duane the programmer, or Duane the engineer, or Duane the anything.. Just duane the eyeballl smasher. I miss that guy. So, if youâ€™re in Vancouver, and can swing flying to TO for New Yearâ€™s drop me a line, and letâ€™s see what we can do.

PS â€“ I havenâ€™t really eaten since coming back from Toronto a few weeks ago, so yes, Iâ€™m getting skinnier.

PPS â€“ After tomorrow, Iâ€™m done my spread of vancomycin, and it didnâ€™t work at all. I havenâ€™t really talked about it at all, but when I was in the hospital with pneumonia, I acquired a life-threatening superbug, once that is extremely hard to get rid of. So if I suddenly disappear for a few weeks at a time, it probably means iâ€™m in the hospital on IV antibiotics. Because, besides for a serious spread of IV, the only option at this point is to remove my colon. Way to go hospital.

PPPS â€“ I routinely get people stop me off the streets and think Iâ€™m Ed Norton. I think I sort of look like it here.

PPPS â€“ I didnâ€™t mean to scare anyone with this entry â€” Iâ€™m ok for now. I have a bunch of treatment options left, but nothing really has done much so far. Iâ€™m still the same old lovable me ðŸ™‚

PPPPS â€“ Tony said heâ€™s only going to TO if a bunch of cute canadian girls hang out with him. So you guys have to sign up and go.
