So, I know there are a bunch of programs available on the Mac for doing photo work and what not, but Iâ€™d like to ask everyone what they use on a daily basis. I have for the most part made due with iPhoto, but the organization capabilities of it suck, and I end up with directories full of photos without any real means to identify them. Unfortunately, I also need something with a relatively quick workflow (photoshop is too slow to use for me except in extreme cases).

Any recommendations?
