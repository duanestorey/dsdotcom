I’ve been busy making plans for April. I haven’t pulled the trigger yet on most of it, but I’ve done a preliminary timetable and the budget works. So this is what it’s looking like.

March 31 – April 5 – New York City, USA  
April 6 – April 10 – Shannon &amp; Limerick, Ireland  
April 11 – April 15 – Edinburgh, Scotland  
April 15 – April 17 – Dublin, Ireland  
April 17 – April 21 – London outskirts, England  
April 21 – April 26 – Paris, France

There’s a bit of bouncing around there, but I’m coordinating meeting up with a few other people, and that’s how it has to happen to work. For example, I’m meeting up with my friend Tanya in Dublin, and my old roommate from university, Jerome, in Paris. I also am trying to stay put during the weekdays so I can get some work done, with most of the travel and changes occurring on the weekends.
