The $1 price point has long been touted as the holy grail for solar technology. At that price, it is basically comparable to fossil fuel based delivery of electricity, making it an economically viable replacement for current technologies. On Tuesday, that [price point was finally reached](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/4306443.html). That doesnâ€™t include the cost of installation currently, but it does show some real progress in that area.
