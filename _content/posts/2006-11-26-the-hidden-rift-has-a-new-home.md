I finally got tired of leaving my computer on 24-7 for this web site, so I set up a hosting account through godaddy. Surprisingly, it wasn’t that hard to transfer everything over from my machine. The funny thing is that I probably am going to save more money on power by having it off than it costs me to host it.

I’m sure there will be a few things here and there that don’t work, but I’ll fix them as I hit them. So, as of now, the computer in my room is completely off, and hopefully I can finally have a good night’s sleep.
