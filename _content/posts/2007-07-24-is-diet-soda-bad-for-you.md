Sylvain [sent me this link today](http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2007/07/24/sodapop-consumer.html) that basically concluded that one or more cans of diet soda can lead to health risks such as [the metabolic syndrome](http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4756)

> “We found that one or more sodas per day increases your risk of new-onset metabolic syndrome by about 45 per cent, and it did not seem to matter if it was regular or diet,” Dr. Ramachandran Vasan, senior investigator for the Framingham Heart Study, said Monday from Boston.

Those are all real bad. The researchers state at the end that they aren’t really sure why, but I’ve read enough over the last few years to have an idea why.

Last year I read a pretty interesting study about the effects of caffeine on the body. The researchers started with pop, and eventually went to caffeine supplements. What they found is that caffeine, in general, causes the body to over-react with insulin. That is, for the same amount of food, the caffeinated person will release far more insulin into their blood than the non-caffeinated person. Insulin, while vital to survival, hardens arteries, and makes it hard to lose weight (since glucagon, the hormone responsible for breaking down fat, will go low in response to the high insulin levels). Also, the current theory is that perpetually high levels on insulin can eventually lead to type-2 diabetes.

That being said, the researchers also noted that this caffeine effect did not seem to happen with coffee. For whatever reason, there is something in coffee that seems to negate the effect of the caffeine on the body.

So, while everyone points to sugar and high fat as the leading causes of obesity in North America (and for sure, they have contributed), there’s growing evidence (at least in my mind) that caffeine (which you can also look as as an almost necessary side-effect of the North America lifestyle) has played a pivotal role. I’ll post some links to studies tonight when I have more time.
