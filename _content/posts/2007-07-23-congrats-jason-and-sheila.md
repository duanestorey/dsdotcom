My friends Jason and Sheila had twins the other night (well technically, Sheila had twins, but I’m sure Jason did his part).

Jason sent an update email yesterday:

> Sheila and I are very proud to announce that the twins were born at  
> 11:44 and 11:45 on Thursday, July 19th, 2007. Their names are Louis  
> Marc Fischl and Hanna Michelle Fischl. Louis was born 6 lbs and Hanna  
> was 5 lbs 7 ounces. Both babies and Mom are doing well and should be  
> home from the hospital on Monday.

So drop Jason and Sheila a comment and congratulate them on their new family. Also, for all you old timers, give them some advice — they’ll need it!
