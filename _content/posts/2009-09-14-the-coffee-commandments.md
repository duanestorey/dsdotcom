Some random thoughts of mine from a coffee shop.

- Thou shalt know thy order before approaching the counter
- Thou shalt not hog the cream station for extended periods of time
- Thou shalt wipe up thy coffee mess after a spill
- Thou shalt not prefix thy coffee order with more than three descriptive words
- Thou shalt not setup a laptop on a table for six when drinking alone
- Thou shalt not order any item that cannot be reliably pronounced
- Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s coffee barista
- Thou shalt not order the devil’s brew – “non fat, no-foam, extra hot latte”
- Thou shalt not put 5 cent syrup in a 5 dollar drink
- Thou shalt not spend more on coffee than on RRSPs or 401ks
