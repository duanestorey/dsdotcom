Back at it again. Now that the Junos are over, I’m basically full swing back into the daily grind. I have an interesting optimization problem at work that I’ll write about at some point (from the perspective of how to speed up compilation of a project), but other than that, it’s just business as usual.

I started getting a tickle in my throat yesterday which has somehow exploded into a full-on sore throat today. So, while I’m at work, I feel like I’m on the verge of getting sick. It’s most likely related to being on a few crowded planes and shaking hands with tons of new people last weekend, and I’m hopeful it passes. I’m going to use this weekend as a chance to catch up on sleep and put my body back on schedule.

I’ve been working on a few projects on the side, one of which involves the homeless community in Vancouver. While not for certain, we might have something to show regarding it next week. So, I’ll keep everyone in the loop.

And finally, [thanks to](http://www.keira-anne.com/2008/04/07/you-cant-trust-mondays/) all [of the people](http://www.miss604.com/2008/04/happy-birthday-duane.html) who [sent me](http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2008/04/yesterday-was-mr-duane-storeys-birthday.htm) some [link love](http://johnbollwitt.com/2008/04/07/duane-does-the-2008-junos/) on [my birthday](http://www.matthewgood.org/2008/04/woops-2/).
